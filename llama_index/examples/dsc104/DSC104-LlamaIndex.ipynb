      "Document(text='President Trump is likely to enter the history books in a new category by the end of Wednesday: as the third president in U.S. history to have been impeached by the House. The votes on impeachment bring to an end the House’s months-long inquiry into whether Trump improperly pressured Ukraine to conduct investigations that would benefit him politically.\\n\\nHere’s how we got to this moment, and what you can expect in the Senate trial that comes next.\\n\\nFirst, what’s happening Wednesday?\\n\\nThe House will spend the day Wednesday debating the two impeachment articles on the House floor. The first article is for abuse of power, and the second is for obstructing the congressional inquiry.\\n\\nLawmakers allotted themselves six hours to debate, but procedural maneuvers mean the proceedings could go well into the evening. Once debate is over, they will vote separately on the two articles of impeachment. If just one passes with a majority vote, Trump will be impeached.\\n\\nThat won’t mean Trump is removed from office. The Senate determines whether that will happen. But let’s back up before we explain that.\\n\\nHow we got here\\n\\nThe events that led to the impeachment inquiry span years, and you can dig into them in this exhaustive timeline. Here’s a shorter recap.\\n\\nSpring and summer 2019\\n\\nThe alleged quid pro quo\\n\\nCongress and the Defense Department approved nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine in early 2019. Out of public view, diplomats were urging Trump to meet with Ukraine’s newly elected president in the Oval Office — a meeting the Ukrainians viewed as an important signal to Russia. But that meeting was pushed off, and the military aid was ordered stopped by the White House. In late July, Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, asking him to “do us a favor though” that included investigating his political opponents and the Biden family.\\n\\nIn August, a whistleblower filed a complaint about that call, alleging Trump had dangled a meeting with Zelensky in exchange for launching investigations into Joe Biden and his son Hunter and into a conspiracy theory about a Democratic National Committee server.\\n\\nSeptember\\n\\nImpeachment inquiry is launched\\n\\nThe Post’s editorial board writes that it had been “reliably told” that Trump was pressuring Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. The existence of the whistleblower complaint is reported by The Washington Post and other outlets. The White House releases a transcript of the call with Zelensky, and the whistleblower complaint becomes public. And Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announces the House will conduct an impeachment inquiry into Trump to see whether his actions on Ukraine render him unfit for office.\\n\\nOctober and November\\n\\nA public investigation\\n\\nThe investigation is underway. It happens behind closed doors at first. Then we get dramatic public testimony by White House aides, many of whom say Trump held up an Oval Office meeting with Ukraine’s president to get those investigations, and many of them say they believed Trump withheld the military aid for the same reason.\\n\\nTrump also blocked his top aides from complying with congressional subpoenas to testify in the investigation.\\n\\nDecember\\n\\nThe vote to impeach\\n\\nThe House Intelligence Committee released a report on the findings of the investigation, and based on that, the Judiciary Committee wrote up the two articles of impeachment the House will vote on Wednesday.\\n\\nWhat the Constitution says about what happens next\\n\\nA president who has been impeached by the House can still serve as president. It’s up to the Senate to hold a trial to decide whether to remove him from office. The two other presidents impeached by the House, Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson, were both acquitted by the Senate.\\n\\nThe Constitution only says that the Senate has to hold a trial, with the senators sitting as jurors, House lawmakers serving as prosecutors known as managers and the chief justice of the United States presiding over it. They must take a public vote, and two-thirds of senators present must agree on whether to convict the president and thus remove him from office. But the Constitution doesn’t lay out exactly how to hold a trial.\\n\\nHow a Senate trial works\\n\\nRules the Senate approved in the 1980s give some guidelines, but the really important stuff — like whether to call witnesses and what kind of evidence to admit and how long to make it — is up to the senators themselves to decide. The only modern guide we have is the Clinton impeachment trial, which allowed no new evidence and only taped witness testimony of key witnesses. It was largely considered a successful example of bipartisan cooperation, as Republicans worked with Democrats to put together as fair a trial as possible.\\n\\nA majority of senators need to agree on the rules for Trump’s impeachment trial. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) will likely try to come to a compromise beforehand on what witnesses to call to avoid a big, dramatic battle during the trial. But they have vastly different views on how to do this. Schumer has said he wants people close to the president during this time, like Trump’s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, or former national security adviser John Bolton, to testify. The Post has reported McConnell wants no witnesses at all. Republicans are also feeling pressured by Trump, who appears ready to use the Senate trial to attack his political opponents and try to undermine his impeachment.\\n\\nOnce senators come to an agreement, we will have a start date for a trial. We expect that will be in January. Senators will start by taking an oath of impartiality and will work six days a week until they’ve voted on both articles of impeachment. If there are witnesses, senators can ask them questions in writing, which the presiding official, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., will read out loud. The president can choose his own lawyers, and they can cross-examine witnesses. The chief justice can overrule something that happens in the trial that he feels is out of line with the rules, but senators can overrule him with a vote.\\n\\nIf Trump is convicted on even one count, the Constitution says he has to be removed from office. Senators could take yet another vote to prevent him from running for office ever again.\\n\\nWhat is the likelihood of the Senate convicting Trump?\\n\\nIt’s low. House Republicans have displayed remarkable unity during the impeachment process — none of them are expected to vote for impeachment. Outside Congress, Trump remains popular among his base. Against that backdrop, it’s hard to see mass defections among Senate Republicans to override their party’s voters and kick the president out of office.\\n\\nA mass defection by members of his own party is what it would take to convict Trump and remove him from office. Twenty of the 53 Republican senators would need to join all Democratic-voting senators to reach the two-thirds supermajority the Constitution requires for impeachment. We count 14 who have expressed at least some level of concern with Trump’s behavior on Ukraine policy, but there are only three senators who have the track record of speaking out against Trump consistently: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah. In addition, it’s not a given that all Senate Democrats stay together. Someone like Joe Manchin III of West Virginia has crossed party lines before.\\n\\nSo, there likely aren’t enough senators to convict Trump as the evidence stands now. But there are enough senators in the middle of the political spectrum to put weight on Senate leaders to conduct a fair trial.\\n\\nWhat does the public say about impeaching Trump?\\n\\nAmericans started out skeptical of removing Trump from office, and after more than two months, they are split basically 50-50 on whether Trump should be impeached by the House and removed from office by the Senate. That includes the all-important independents, who are split, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.\\n\\nPOLL Washington Post-ABC News Poll Americans still split along partisan lines over impeachment Q: Based on what you know, do you think Congress should or should not impeach Trump and remove him from office?

      "Document(text='Disappearing Dan has finally disappeared.\\n\\nOne of America’s worst chief executive officers lost his job this month, and hardly anyone noticed.\\n\\nDan McCarthy presided over what was probably the worst takeover ever in the cable industry when his Frontier Communications purchased Verizon Fios broadband and cable TV accounts in Texas, Florida and California. The transfer happened, appropriately, on April Fool’s Day 2016.\\n\\nAt first, most customers didn’t know the sale occurred. Then when thousands of cable TV, internet and phone accounts suddenly shut down, customers figured it out.\\n\\nThe Watchdog’s inbox overflowed with complaints.\\n\\nAfter receiving internal company documents, I reported after the one-year anniversary of the takeover that Frontier had lost 100,000 Texas customers. That was fully one-fifth of its Texas customer base. It didn’t get much better.\\n\\nFinally, earlier this month, the Frontier board waved bye-bye to McCarthy, a 29-year company veteran.\\n\\nWhat took so long?\\n\\n$17 billion debt\\n\\nTo no one’s surprise, Disappearing Dan left the company in horrible shape, on the verge of bankruptcy. The company stares down a $17 billion debt. During one three-month period last year, the company lost $5 billion.\\n\\n{\"unitName\":\"dfpPosition1\",\"display\":\"mobile\",\"isMobile\":false} hidden ad unit\\n\\nRemember that cable service companies have a license to print money. (Look at your bill.)\\n\\nMcCarthy fired thousands of longtime employees, many of whom go back to the early GTE days. (Bell Atlantic bought GTE and renamed it Verizon.)\\n\\nMcCarthy, in my opinion, was so harmful to the industry that he made his AT&T counterpart, Randall Stephenson, look like Alexander Graham Bell.\\n\\nStock jumped\\n\\nWhen the Frontier board pushed McCarthy out, the company stock price jumped 7%.\\n\\nWhen former Frontier CEO Dan McCarthy lost his job in December 2019, the company`s stock price went up. (Screen shot from company video)\\n\\nOn one stock-related message board, comments were scorching.\\n\\n“Jesse James has left the gang,” a commenter wrote.\\n\\n“Wall Street will soon own a valuable company on the cheap at the expense of many,” another predicted.\\n\\n“How can you do such an awful job for this long, while collecting a seven-figure paycheck?” another wrote. “Wow. This dude made a killing.”\\n\\n{\"unitName\":\"dfpPosition2\",\"display\":\"mobile\",\"isMobile\":false} hidden ad unit\\n\\nCustomers’ frustration\\n\\nI don’t need a stock market message board to illustrate McCarthy’s failures. I have a file full of complaints from this year alone. The common denominator was that customers couldn’t get their problems solved.\\n\\nMichael Randazzo said his internet speed didn’t match the speed he was promised in Frontier’s TV ad.\\n\\n“Frontier would make a great case for musical chairs when it comes to finding anyone in their organization taking responsibility,” he said.\\n\\nMike Howard told me how he paid his monthly bill by check, but Frontier didn’t deposit it. Howard got penalized for late payment.\\n\\nJerry Frankel was quoted one price for service, but the email he received to verify the contract was for a much higher price. With some difficulty, he cancelled.\\n\\nBecky Tharp had a problem involving a cable that had to be buried on her property.\\n\\n“This is the worst company I have ever encountered,” she said. “When you call you are on hold for literally hours. No kidding.”\\n\\nJan Peak paid her monthly bill 13 days early. She still got hit with a late fee.\\n\\nSue Murray was quoted a price of $140 plus tax, but $336 was extracted from her bank account through autopay. She was promised a refund for a portion of the difference. But actually getting it was like rolling a boulder up a hill.\\n\\n{\"unitName\":\"dfpPosition3\",\"display\":\"mobile\",\"isMobile\":false} hidden ad unit\\n\\nAnna Brechoteau had a billing issue and complained to the Texas attorney general. “Frontier was supposed to investigate and get back with me,” she said. “They never followed up, and then they wrote to the A.G. that we had come up with an agreement. I told the A.G. that is not true.”\\n\\nMarie Amarante saw her bill shoot up from $176 to $456. “The internet was disconnected for almost a whole week,” she said. Trying to fix her bill, she spoke to more than a dozen employees. “They always promise to call back and never do. I am really at the end of my rope.”\\n\\nAs he cut employees and appeared to de-emphasize customer service, McCarthy kept, by modern CEO standards, a low public profile in his company’s Connecticut headquarters. He ran one of the nation’s largest cable companies, but when he left, the Wall Street Journal didn’t bother to write a story.\\n\\nNo answers\\n\\nI sent Frontier vice president Javier Mendoza a set of six questions for this Watchdog column.\\n\\nHe responded by sending me a copy of the company’s two-week-old news release, which I’d already read.\\n\\nThe good news here is that the new CEO has an impressive resume.\\n\\nMeet Bernard “Bernie” Han. He knows the industry, having spent 11 years at DISH Network, where he served as chief financial officer, chief operating officer and executive vice president. One of his areas of authority was customer service. (The Watchdog rarely hears complaints about DISH.)\\n\\nTwo months ago, Frontier brought Han on as a financial adviser.\\n\\n“He has a passion for serving customers,” the company announcement states.\\n\\n{\"unitName\":\"dfpPosition4\",\"display\":\"mobile\",\"isMobile\":false} hidden ad unit\\n\\nHan previously worked for 20 years in the airline industry. He was CFO at Northwest Airlines and also worked as a financial analyst for American Airlines.\\n\\nBloomberg News reported that Frontier’s creditors are antsy and pushing for changes.\\n\\nA corporate reorganization is likely, and a big debt payment is looming, the news service reported.\\n\\nThis is a fresh start for Frontier and its customers.

      "Document(text='Basketball season is back.\\n\\nA year after Franklin ran the table and finished a perfect season with a Tournament of Champions title, the 2019-20 season figures to be one defined by parity and equity.

Brynn Farrell, a Florida commit, leads that group after an impressive debut season at the Belmar school. Lafayette commit Makayla Andrews played a big role in the second half of last season after transferring in from Neptune and point guard Abigail Antognoli developed into one of the state`s best floor generals. Expect big things from the Purple Roses this season with a T of C title well in sight.\\n\\nSecond year coach Mary Beth Chambers will miss the first two games of this season as punishment for a recruiting violation.\\n\\n2-Trenton Catholic | Final 2018-19 ranking: No. 6\\n\\nPerhaps no team will see a better year-to-year improvement at the top of the rankings than Trenton Catholic, coming off an appearance in the Non-Public B title game. The Iron Mikes welcome back a pair of Division-1 bound seniors in West Virginia commit Giana Boulden and UCF recruit Maniya Custis, but add in some key pieces that could put TCA over the top. Long Island Lutheran transfer Aalyah Del Rosario, behind a 6-5 frame, will make an immediate impact, as will incoming freshman Zoe Brooks.

Destiny Adams, now a junior and one of the most sought-after prospects in the country, will elevate into a bigger role this season. Kemari Reynolds, a UPenn commit, returns as a senior to run the floor and Manchester Township should get a major lift from two promising freshmen: Gabby Ross and Angelica Velez.\\n\\n4-Rutgers Prep | Final 2018-19 ranking: No. 11\\n\\nRutgers Prep returns all but one player from last year`s lineup. The Argonauts are going to be one of the most talented teams and one of the deepest squads in the state as they look to take back control in Somerset County and Non-Public B. St. Joseph`s commit Olivia Mullins and Rider commit Molly Lynch will lead this team as starting guards, but also keep an eye on 3-point ace Kylie Favours. It`s going to be hard to guard a combination of talent like that and Rutgers Prep also has size that is going to bother teams this year. Center Christina Dalce is one of the best rebounders in the state and she should be even better in her second year at Rutgers Prep. Katherine Donahue showed a lot of grit and poise as a rookie last season. She`ll look to take on an even bigger role this winter and add to a loaded lineup at Rutgers Prep. Macey Mento, Julia Nilsen, Belle Pellecchia, Mia Yanogacio, Leyla Castro, Toni Polvere and Morgan Ryan are also back for the Argonauts.\\n\\nTom Horak | For NJ Advance Media Bishop Ahr Head Coach Brittney Griffin holds up the GMC conference championship plaque after defeating Edison 47-32 in the Greater Middlesex Conference Tournament final at Middlesex County College on 2/22/19. Tom Horak | For NJ Advance Media\\n\\n5-St. Thomas Aquinas | Final 2018-19 ranking: No. 8\\n\\nFormerly known as Bishop Ahr, St. Thomas Aquinas opens the season as a Top-5 ranked team — and for good reason. Coming off perhaps the best season in school history, St. Thomas Aquinas returns its entire starting lineup from a team that ended a nearly-two-decade-long drought in the Middlesex County Tournament and battled perennial power St. John Vianney in the state tournament.\\n\\nEmma Boslet, Kelsey Ransom and Akiyah Baker will headline St. Thomas Aquinas` lineup this season, while Madison Ruddy and Megan Herka will be essential in that starting five again.\\n\\n6-St. John Vianney | Final 2018-19 ranking: No. 5\\n\\nSt. John Vianney will lean on its young talent this season after a disappointing finish a season that ended without a championship despite its senior-heavy lineup. Now, juniors Katie Hill and Christina Whitehead and surging sophomore Madison St. Rose will look to drag St. John Vianney out of its postseason slump and get the Lancers back on top. This will be one of the youngest teams that Dawn Karpell has fielded in some time, but that could work to Vianney`s advantage with the absence of mounting pressure night after night.\\n\\n7-Immaculate Heart | Final 2018-19 ranking: No. 7\\n\\nImmaculate Heart put together a great season a year ago, but this winter could be even better for the Bergen County squad. Northwestern commit Anna Morris is one of the best two-sport athletes in the state and she is looking to end her career with a Tournament of Champions title in basketball to go along with the ones she`s captured on the volleyball court. Morris is one of the best forwards back in the state this season and she`ll be the centerpiece of this veteran team. Junior A`Nyah Barker missed most of last season as she recovered from a knee injury, but if she`s back at full strength, she`s going to one of the most dynamic guards on the court this winter. Seniors Brittany Graff, Emma Matesic and Samantha Rinaldi are all back as well for the Blue Eagles, who have won the last eight North, Non-Public A championships. It`s been five years since Immaculate Heart won an overall Non-Public A title though and this year`s squad is dead set on ending that drought.\\n\\n8-Franklin | Final 2018-19 ranking: No. 1\\n\\nThe defending Tournament of Champions winners bring back guards Keona and Kennady Schenck. Losing Diamond Miller and Tiana Jackson to graduation and Christina Midgette to injury leaves some big holes to fill, but the Schenck twins have been hitting clutch shots and making game-changing plays for years. Now, they`re ready to take over as team leaders. Guard Onoseta Ufuah come off the bench and provided big minutes during Franklin`s undefeated season a year ago. The senior will have a chance to crack the starting rotation now and give the Warriors another dynamic guard to count on. Forward Kyierah Dempsey-Toney should see an uptick in minutes and her height could be a big advantage. Things are going to look at little different at Franklin this year, but this program has proven that it is one of the best in the state and the Warriors still have a lot of talent that makes this team a serious title contender.\\n\\n9-Cherokee | Final 2018-19 ranking: No. 14\\n\\nCherokee`s season has ended in a sectional title game losses two years in a row now and thought should provide plenty of motivation entering 2019-20 as South Jersey`s top-ranked team. Alexa Therien will elevate into her most prominent role yet, now as a junior after a sensational sophomore season. Kennedy Wilburn and Katie Fricker will be key returners for Ron Powell as Cherokee has a serious chance to make a run at a Group 4 title — but getting through South Jersey, Group 4 is the first hurdle.\\n\\n10-Red Bank Catholic | Final 2018-19 ranking: No. 18\\n\\nRed Bank Catholic returns nearly its entire lineup from a year ago and that continuity should put the Caseys solidly in the Top 10. Junior guard and Fordham commit Sophia Sabino will be the general on the floor with plenty of support around her. Justine Pissott will look to build off a sensational freshman season, alongside classmate Ally Carman. Lehigh commit Fabienne Eggenschwiler will give Red Bank Catholic a veteran, senior presence on the court which could prove pivotal if the Caseys make a deep run in the Shore Conference and Non-Public A state tournament.\\n\\nScott Faytok | For NJ Advance Me Tara Johnson (23) of University takes a jumper over Elley Wells (5) of Cresskill during the NJSIAA North Jersey, Group 1 girls basketball semifinal between University and Cresskill at Ramapo High School in Franklin Lakes, NJ on 3-6-19.\\n\\n11-University | Final 2018-19 ranking: No. 12\\n\\nThe two-time defending Group 1 champions aren`t shy about their expectations for this winter. University wants to make it back to the Tournament of Champions and it wants to win the whole thing. That is the type of mentality that has been set in stone at the Newark school the last five years. Hofstra commit Zyhemia Swint is one of the state`s top forwards and her ability to pull down rebounds gives University a big possession advantage and creates second-chance opportunities. Junior Tara Johnson also has a knack for pulling down rebounds and keeps getting better and better on the offensive end year after year. Senior transfer Sha`Nia Davis is joining the mix this season and will give University an offensive boost after losing point guard Tanesha Tucker to a season-ending knee injury. Davis transferred to Patrick School from Delaware last winter, but missed the season with an injury. Junior Sidney Williams and sophomore Wadiah Findley will also be playmakers to watch in this starting lineup.\\n\\n12-Saddle River Day | Final 2018-19 ranking: No. 2\\n\\nSaddle River Day`s lineup was special last year with four Division-I commits leading the Rebels to the Tournament of Champions final. The Bergen County squad is going to have to find different ways to replace all of talent, but it has players back that are ready for the challenge. NYU commit Jordan Janowski has made a name for herself with defense the last few years, but she`s going to take on a larger offensive role this winter. The senior has shown flashes and this is now her time to show everyone what she is made of. Sophomore Cierra Pearson missed the end of last season with an injury, but before she went out, the guard showed that she had the skills to crack the lineup for the Rebels. She`ll be expected to expand her game this season and give Saddle River Day another player to count on.\\n\\n13-Hudson Catholic | Final 2018-19 ranking: No. 15\\n\\nZanai Jones started to take control of this offense a year ago and she`ll be even more of a floor general this winter. Jones was part of a young, talented team last season. Well, the Hawks bring back almost their entire rotation and will be one of the deepest teams in the state. This team is full of potential and now is the time to cash in on it and break out. Kayla Beckford, Adiana Pacheco and Anasia Staton are all back after playing big roles. This is a team that does the little things well and that`s going to help the Hawks separate themselves. Beckford, Pacheco, Watson and Staton all have a height advantage and they were all solid on the boards last year. If Hudson Catholic can out-rebound teams and create second-chance opportunities, it`s going to be hard to slow this team down.\\n\\nMatt Smith | For NJ Advance Medi Manasquan`s Georgia Heine (15) looks to pass the ball during a game against Patrick School in the Coaches Choice Showcase on Jan. 27, 2019, at Holmdel High School in Holmdel, New Jersey. Matt Smith | For NJ Advance Media\\n\\n14-Manasquan | Final 2018-19 ranking: No. 9\\n\\nThis will be a new-look Manasquan team this year, oddly without a committed Power-5 conference player for the first time in nearly a decade. Even though last season ended without a trip to the Tournament of Champions, ending a five-year run, it did give its younger players a chance to gain valuable experience. Those players — namely Georgia Heine, Brooke Hollawell and Dorothy Loffredo — will be back in more pronounced scoring roles this year. St. Rose transfer Mary Donnelly will give Manasquan a big boost, but the Warriors will have some work to do to contend at the top of the Shore Conference.\\n\\n15-Rumson-Fair Haven | Final 2018-19 ranking: No. 27\\n\\nPreseason injuries didn`t do Rumson-Fair Haven any favors, but depth will be one of the Bulldogs` strengths this year with hopes of rejoining the conversation as one of the best teams in the Shore Conference. With Grace Munt`s status down the road unknown, Lucy Adams will be Rumson`s key interior player with plenty of big-game experience. Cortland McBarron and Sophia Passalaqua will anchor RFH`s play on the perimeter and a host of young talent will play big minutes for Dave Callahan this season.\\n\\n16-Bayonne | Final 2018-19 ranking: No. 19\\n\\nSophomore Eniya Scott is back and ready to roll for a Bayonne team that is ready for championship chases in Hudson County and North 2, Group 4. Scott was the Co-Player of the Year in Hudson County last season and returns with high expectations. The young guard showed she is ready for the moment last winter and she`ll be even more dynamic this season. Makoye Diawara is one of the best players around in the paint and her ability to score down low and snag rebounds is going to make Bayonne a tough team to deal with. Mary Grace Lavin transferred to Bayonne last season and was an immediate impact once she became eligible. The senior will be one of the leaders on this year`s team and her ability to score will be key. Jada Phillips and Jolyssa Moody saw a lot of time last year and Bayonne will need them both to take a step forward to fortify this lineup.\\n\\nAndrew Mills | NJ Advance Media Kylee Watson (22) of Mainland with the NJSIAA Group III girls basketball state championship trophy after the Mustangs beat Chatham, 42-35, on Sunday, March 10, 2019. Andrew Mills | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\\n\\n17-Mainland | Final 2018-19 ranking: No. 20\\n\\nA solid group is back for the defending Group 3 champions, led, of course, by Oregon commit Kylee Watson. Watson will be a legitimate Player of the Year candidate entering her final season at Mainland and, flanked by a strong supporting cast in Camryn Dirkes, Kaitlyn Boggs and Madison Hafetz, the Mustangs should be favored to reach the T of C for the second straight year through Group 3.\\n\\n18-Gill St. Bernard’s | Final 2018-19 ranking: Not Ranked\\n\\nGill St. Bernard’s finished just a game above .500 last season, but the Somerset County squad has a lot to look forward to now. FDU commit Devyn Scott and Ella Fajardo make up a really good backcourt and with their ability to score and create plays for teammates, the Knights will be a handful. Caileigh Walsh is a mismatch down low and she`s a game-changer for Gill St. Bernard’s. The junior could take her game to another level this winter and if she does, the state better watch out. Gill St. Bernard`s has all the talent to be one of the most feared teams in New Jersey. The Knights just need to put it together.\\n\\n19-Morris Catholic | Final 2018-19 ranking: No. 38\\n\\nMorris Catholic will have a new look this winter, but one mainstay that is back is floor general Mimi Rubino. The senior scored 13 points a game last season and got more comfortable running the offense down the stretch. She`s back this year as the leader of a team that will also feature Wayne Hills transfer Nicole Strumolo, Hudson Catholic transfer Jadyn Watson and freshman Tyonna Bailey. That lineup will have Morris Catholic in the championship hunt.\\n\\n20-Moorestown Friends | Final 2018-19 ranking: No. 31\\n\\nMoorestown Friends returns two of the state’s best scorers this season in Villanova commit Bella Runyan and surging sophomore Veyoni Davis. Both of those players averaged better than 20 points per game last season and should place Moorestown Friends firmly in the conversation as one of the best teams in South Jersey.\\n\\nBrian Deakyne and Brandon Gould cover girls basketball and may be reached at bdeakyne@njadvancemedia.com and bgould@njadvancemedia.com.

Now, one player from each of those teams - Mater Dei DB Clarence Lewis and Red Bank Catholic TE Kevin Bauman - are heading to South Bend to play for Notre Dame. Speaking of Bauman, his welcome video from Notre Dame’s official Twitter account may have been the best out of all Jersey recruits Wednesday (see video below).\\n\\n- We’d have to check the film, but there’s a good chance St. Joseph DB Terrence Spence was manned up against St. Peter’s Prep WR Byron Shipman at some point during their regular season showdown at Caven Point this season. Now, the two SFC United Red rivals will pair up at Holy Cross.\\n\\n- Sticking with the St. Peter’s Prep/St. Joseph (Mont.) theme, two NJ.com All-State selections - OL Luke Wypler (SJR) and LB Cody Simon (SPP) - will now be teammates at Ohio State. Both have state championship rings they can bring with them to Columbus, too. A similar case will happen at Rutgers, too, with both SJR’s Elijuwan Mack and SPP’s Isaiah Wright becoming teammates at RU.\\n\\n- Old Tappan’s Patrick Passalacqua and Ridgewood’s James Miller squared off against each other this season, both hailing from Bergen County. Ridgewood won a tight one, 16-15, that night, and now both players are heading to Columbia.\\n\\n- A different type of ‘we meet again,’ but when St. Joseph (Mont.) DL Amin Vanover arrives at Penn State, he’ll be reunited with 2019 St. Joseph graduate Smith Vilbert. In 2018, the pair of star defensive linemen helped lead the Green Knights to the Non-Public Group 4 state title.\\n\\n- How cool is this one? At some point over the next few years, Bergen Catholic OL Bryan Felter could be blocking for Don Bosco Prep RB Kyle Monangai at Rutgers. Felter was one of the first to publicly reach out to Monangai after his verbal commitment Wednesday night, tweeting at him, “Let’s go bro. #ChopNation.”\\n\\n- Another Bosco/Bergen connection here, this one at Stony Brook, as Bergen Catholic OL Collin Tunc and Don Bosco Prep DL Jahmir Greene will both be future Seawolves.\\n\\n- Cedar Creek’s Malachi Melton and Willingboro’s Chris Long met in this year’s season opener. Melton’s team got the win, but Long hauled in five catches for 140 yards and two touchdowns. Now, they’ll be teammates at Rutgers.\\n\\n- Highland LB Brad Small was dealt the task of trying to help slow down St. Joseph (Hamm.) RB Jada Byers this year in the season opener. Hand did his part, with a team-best nine tackles, but Byers’ 133 yards and 2 TD were enough to lead St. Joseph to a 34-20 win. Now, Hand will only have to deal with Byers in practices, with the two South Jersey stars teaming up at Sacred Heart.\\n\\n- The Bergen Catholic-to-Princeton wide receiver pipeline is growing. With Pierson Tobia’s commitment this year, he becomes the second Crusaders WR to head to Princeton in the last three years, joining 2018 graduate Dylan Classi. Princeton picked up three Bergen County recruits, as St. Joseph (Mont.)`s Arman Young and New Milford’s Tyler Picinic joining Tobia at the Ivy League school.\\n\\n- Bryant, with six New Jersey commits on Wednesday, was tied for second-most, behind only Rutgers. What’s the Jersey connection at a school that did not become a full Division I program until 2012? Former Paramus Catholic standout and Rutgers assistant coach Marquise Watson is currently Bryant’s defensive line/run game coordinator and Scott Lakatos, a former Rutgers’ secondary coach from 2001-03 (during Greg Schiano’s first go-around), joined the Bryant staff prior to the 2019 season. The West Morris graduate has held recent assistant coach positions at Red Bank Regional (2017) and Monmouth University (2015-16), too.\\n\\n- Stanford has been almost automatic at scooping up one New Jersey recruit per year, with this year’s Class of 2020 commit being Delbarton TE Lukas Ungar. Before that, Bergen Catholic’s Aeneas DiCosmo (‘19), Pope John’s Dalyn Wade-Perry (’17), Paramus Catholic’s Donald Stewart (‘16) and St. Peter’s Prep’s Jordan Fox (’15) all opted to head west to play for the Cardinal. Stanford has only been shutout in Jersey from the Class of 2018 over the last six years.\\n\\n- There were five notable players who remained committed to their respective schools Wednesday, though did not sign National Letters of Intent: Don Bosco Prep’s Arsheen Jiles (Sacred Heart), St. Joseph (Met.)`s K-Shawn Schulters (Villanova), Williamstown’s Brandon Perkins (Kent State), Summit’s Joe Lusardi (UMass) and Penns Grove’s Jaylen Newton (Delaware State). Additionally, Lyndhurst’s Piotr Partyla is a committed preferred walk-on to Northern Illinois, but still is receiving interest from other programs.\\n\\n- Rutgers still has at least seven offers on the table, according to 247sports.com, to notable recruits we tracked Wednesday: Don Bosco Prep RB Jalen Berger, East Orange ATH Nasir Montgomery, Paterson Kennedy LB Jamier Wright-Collins, Toms River North OL Najae Hallenbeck, Long Branch RB Jermaine Corbett, Woodbury QB Andre Parker and Peddie OL Alexander Gilbertson.\\n\\nHS teammates to college teammates:\\n\\nIan Franzoni and John Parsons - Hun to Brown\\n\\nColin Ramos and Romaine Robinson - Don Bosco Prep to Navy\\n\\nBen Silver and Colin Elliott - St. Peter’s Prep to Bryant\\n\\nQuinn Hart and Jon Wood - Williamstown to Sacred Heart\\n\\nMuheem McCargo and Dyshier Clary - Woodrow Wilson to Temple\\n\\nJJ Conrad focuses on the Super Football Conference and North Jersey Interscholastic Conference.

Now, one player from each of those teams - Mater Dei DB Clarence Lewis and Red Bank Catholic TE Kevin Bauman - are heading to South Bend to play for Notre Dame. Speaking of Bauman, his welcome video from Notre Dame’s official Twitter account may have been the best out of all Jersey recruits Wednesday (see video below).\\n\\n- We’d have to check the film, but there’s a good chance St. Joseph DB Terrence Spence was manned up against St. Peter’s Prep WR Byron Shipman at some point during their regular season showdown at Caven Point this season. Now, the two SFC United Red rivals will pair up at Holy Cross.\\n\\n- Sticking with the St. Peter’s Prep/St. Joseph (Mont.) theme, two NJ.com All-State selections - OL Luke Wypler (SJR) and LB Cody Simon (SPP) - will now be teammates at Ohio State. Both have state championship rings they can bring with them to Columbus, too. A similar case will happen at Rutgers, too, with both SJR’s Elijuwan Mack and SPP’s Isaiah Wright becoming teammates at RU.\\n\\n- Old Tappan’s Patrick Passalacqua and Ridgewood’s James Miller squared off against each other this season, both hailing from Bergen County. Ridgewood won a tight one, 16-15, that night, and now both players are heading to Columbia.\\n\\n- A different type of ‘we meet again,’ but when St. Joseph (Mont.) DL Amin Vanover arrives at Penn State, he’ll be reunited with 2019 St. Joseph graduate Smith Vilbert. In 2018, the pair of star defensive linemen helped lead the Green Knights to the Non-Public Group 4 state title.\\n\\n- How cool is this one? At some point over the next few years, Bergen Catholic OL Bryan Felter could be blocking for Don Bosco Prep RB Kyle Monangai at Rutgers. Felter was one of the first to publicly reach out to Monangai after his verbal commitment Wednesday night, tweeting at him, “Let’s go bro. #ChopNation.”\\n\\n- Another Bosco/Bergen connection here, this one at Stony Brook, as Bergen Catholic OL Collin Tunc and Don Bosco Prep DL Jahmir Greene will both be future Seawolves.\\n\\n- Cedar Creek’s Malachi Melton and Willingboro’s Chris Long met in this year’s season opener. Melton’s team got the win, but Long hauled in five catches for 140 yards and two touchdowns. Now, they’ll be teammates at Rutgers.\\n\\n- Highland LB Brad Small was dealt the task of trying to help slow down St. Joseph (Hamm.) RB Jada Byers this year in the season opener. Hand did his part, with a team-best nine tackles, but Byers’ 133 yards and 2 TD were enough to lead St. Joseph to a 34-20 win. Now, Hand will only have to deal with Byers in practices, with the two South Jersey stars teaming up at Sacred Heart.\\n\\n- The Bergen Catholic-to-Princeton wide receiver pipeline is growing. With Pierson Tobia’s commitment this year, he becomes the second Crusaders WR to head to Princeton in the last three years, joining 2018 graduate Dylan Classi. Princeton picked up three Bergen County recruits, as St. Joseph (Mont.)`s Arman Young and New Milford’s Tyler Picinic joining Tobia at the Ivy League school.\\n\\n- Bryant, with six New Jersey commits on Wednesday, was tied for second-most, behind only Rutgers. What’s the Jersey connection at a school that did not become a full Division I program until 2012? Former Paramus Catholic standout and Rutgers assistant coach Marquise Watson is currently Bryant’s defensive line/run game coordinator and Scott Lakatos, a former Rutgers’ secondary coach from 2001-03 (during Greg Schiano’s first go-around), joined the Bryant staff prior to the 2019 season. The West Morris graduate has held recent assistant coach positions at Red Bank Regional (2017) and Monmouth University (2015-16), too.\\n\\n- Stanford has been almost automatic at scooping up one New Jersey recruit per year, with this year’s Class of 2020 commit being Delbarton TE Lukas Ungar. Before that, Bergen Catholic’s Aeneas DiCosmo (‘19), Pope John’s Dalyn Wade-Perry (’17), Paramus Catholic’s Donald Stewart (‘16) and St. Peter’s Prep’s Jordan Fox (’15) all opted to head west to play for the Cardinal. Stanford has only been shutout in Jersey from the Class of 2018 over the last six years.\\n\\n- There were five notable players who remained committed to their respective schools Wednesday, though did not sign National Letters of Intent: Don Bosco Prep’s Arsheen Jiles (Sacred Heart), St. Joseph (Met.)`s K-Shawn Schulters (Villanova), Williamstown’s Brandon Perkins (Kent State), Summit’s Joe Lusardi (UMass) and Penns Grove’s Jaylen Newton (Delaware State). Additionally, Lyndhurst’s Piotr Partyla is a committed preferred walk-on to Northern Illinois, but still is receiving interest from other programs.\\n\\n- Rutgers still has at least seven offers on the table, according to 247sports.com, to notable recruits we tracked Wednesday: Don Bosco Prep RB Jalen Berger, East Orange ATH Nasir Montgomery, Paterson Kennedy LB Jamier Wright-Collins, Toms River North OL Najae Hallenbeck, Long Branch RB Jermaine Corbett, Woodbury QB Andre Parker and Peddie OL Alexander Gilbertson.\\n\\nHS teammates to college teammates:\\n\\nIan Franzoni and John Parsons - Hun to Brown\\n\\nColin Ramos and Romaine Robinson - Don Bosco Prep to Navy\\n\\nBen Silver and Colin Elliott - St. Peter’s Prep to Bryant\\n\\nQuinn Hart and Jon Wood - Williamstown to Sacred Heart\\n\\nMuheem McCargo and Dyshier Clary - Woodrow Wilson to Temple\\n\\nJJ Conrad focuses on the Super Football Conference and North Jersey Interscholastic Conference.

      "Document(text='NEWARK, New Jersey (Reuters) - In the dreary archives of a Newark, New Jersey, courthouse, Ronald Motley found a treasure map.\\n\\nLawyer Ronald Motley poses for a photo in this 1982 handout photo. .Steve Kagan/Handout via REUTERS.\\n\\nIt was an evidence log, a detailed inventory of documents and other exhibits that had been used in an injured worker’s lawsuit. And it was freely available to anyone who bothered to look for it – for this was long ago in 1978, before the routine use of protective orders, sealed documents and other tools of concealment wrapped U.S. courts in lethal secrecy.\\n\\nMotley, a lanky, deep-drawling South Carolina lawyer, had been representing sick workers in lawsuits against companies that used asbestos. And he was losing, as defense lawyers convinced juries that the companies had only recently learned of the dangers of the cancer-causing mineral. Now, the log might guide him to proof that the companies had long known that asbestos exposure could be deadly.\\n\\nThe proof came in a carton of documents that had belonged to Sumner Simpson, once president of manufacturer Raybestos-Manhattan Inc. The documents exposed a conspiracy of suppression and silence among multiple companies even as workers sickened and died. “I think the less said about asbestos,” Simpson wrote in a 1935 letter to a lawyer at another company, “the better off we are.”\\n\\nMotley shared the documents with other plaintiff lawyers and with Los Angeles Times reporter Henry Weinstein, who was with Motley in Newark that day in 1978 and recounted the lawyer’s discovery to Reuters. A member of Congress got them, too. In a matter of months, the Sumner Simpson papers unlocked what one prominent plaintiff lawyer had dubbed a new “industrial Watergate.” Congress held hearings, workplace safety rules were enacted, workers won more lawsuits, and scores of companies, including Raybestos, declared bankruptcy. The companies set up victim trust funds that have paid out more than $30 billion in settlements and that continue compensating victims even now.\\n\\nToday, there’s little chance a lawyer – or a journalist or a concerned citizen – could do what Motley did. That’s because in the intervening decades, big business and its legal lieutenants succeeded in a focused, concerted campaign that has ensured that secrecy cloaks lawsuits alleging that their products can kill or injure people.\\n\\n“The federal judiciary’s commitment to open justice has come under sustained attack by corporate lawyers and lobbyists,” said Representative Hank Johnson, a Georgia Democrat and member of the House Judiciary Committee. “Corporations are allowed to hide evidence that they sacrificed their customers’ health and safety in the name of corporate efficiencies.”\\n\\nThe asbestos settlements – the biggest mass tort in U.S. history by number of claims – ushered in a wave of product-liability litigation. Suddenly, corporate America had a new problem: myriad demands from plaintiff lawyers for internal records that could expose executives to broad scrutiny for what they knew and failed to do about potential threats their products posed to public health and safety.\\n\\nA CLOSED SYSTEM\\n\\nIn response, the corporate defense bar and its allies transformed the taxpayer-funded courts into a much more closed system, according to a Reuters review of hundreds of judicial policy documents and court filings and dozens of interviews. The corporate lawyers found ready support from judges and court staff overwhelmed by all the litigation and the paperwork it produced.\\n\\nOver the years, they threw a blanket of confidentiality over discovery, the pretrial exchange of information between opposing sides. They turned protective orders into pro forma exercises to muzzle lawyers who might otherwise share pertinent information with regulators or the public. And they succeeded in getting judges to routinely seal court filings, thus ensuring that when lawsuits are settled before trial, as usually happens in product-liability cases, the evidence remains hidden.\\n\\nThe toll is high. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed or seriously injured by allegedly harmful products after judges in recent years allowed litigants to file under seal, beyond public view, evidence that could have alerted consumers and regulators to the dangers. The secrecy allowed drug makers to market painkillers as safe while the body count from the opioid-related epidemic mounted; auto makers to sell cars with lethally weak roofs that killed people in rollovers though tests had years earlier revealed the risk; gun maker Remington to knowingly sell rifles with bum triggers that killed scores of people.\\n\\nHad today’s secrecy-friendly court rules been in place 40 years ago, the evidence log Motley found in Newark wouldn’t have been filed publicly. Even if he had found the Sumner Simpson papers by other means, he almost certainly couldn’t have shared them as he did. And had he filed them in court to support his case, Raybestos would very likely have requested – and been granted – a court seal.\\n\\nThe forces of secrecy wore down the longstanding norm of openness in the judicial system by exploiting a pivotal Supreme Court decision and lobbying Congress and the obscure but powerful panel that sets the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\\n\\nThey argued that U.S. businesses had a right to privacy similar to what individuals enjoy, and that limiting that right threatened the foundations of American free enterprise. They said it was the courts’ responsibility to protect companies from the unfair and damaging publicity that can arise from unproven allegations that their products are dangerous. As a Ford Motor Co lawyer told Congress in 1994, such allegations cause “substantial harm” not only to defendants, but also to the public because they are misleading.\\n\\nAmong the most forceful fighters for secrecy was lobbyist Al Cortese. Companies defending against lawsuits need protective and sealing orders to contain costs, prevent negative publicity and safeguard trade secrets and intellectual property, Cortese said in an interview. Now retired, Cortese remains a true believer in the cause: Company files are not public information, even when they are a part of a public court case, he said. “It’s private information, and therefore there is a right to protect that information in litigation … It’s a fundamental principle.”\\n\\nAs Reuters revealed earlier in this series, judges sealed evidence relevant to public health and safety in dozens of the biggest defective-product cases consolidated in federal court over the past 20 years. Those cases comprised nearly 250,000 individual death and injury lawsuits, involving drugs, cars, medical devices and other products used by millions of consumers. Broadly worded protective orders gave the parties the power to mark almost any document as confidential in 45 of the cases.\\n\\nAfter Reuters published its first report on court secrecy, U.S. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said at a hearing on transparency in the courts that he planned to reintroduce the Sunshine in Litigation Act. Prior versions of the bill would have allowed litigants to share evidence related to public health and safety with regulators, regardless of protective orders. Those earlier bills, introduced regularly over the past 30 years, stalled amid opposition from business groups that argued the legislation would increase the costs and burdens of civil litigation.\\n\\nJudge Richard Story, speaking for the federal judiciary at the September hearing, did not dispute Reuters’ findings. He acknowledged that judges sometimes fail to scrutinize sealed documents, as required, to determine whether secrecy is justified. “That can happen,” he said. “I will be honest with you.”\\n\\nTRADITION OF TRANSPARENCY\\n\\nWhen plaintiff lawyers like Ron Motley started suing the asbestos industry on behalf of dying workers in the 1970s, the federal courts were radically different. They operated under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as drafted in the 1930s by a committee of lawyers and law school professors. They imbued the rules with the tradition of open trials that had evolved over centuries of Anglo-American common law.\\n\\nThe rules on public access to the courts also reflected the progressive politics of the era, said Stephen Burbank, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School. Progressives believed that transparency was essential for public institutions to govern effectively and that secrecy impaired the public’s ability to gauge whether the courts decided cases fairly, Burbank said.\\n\\n“The spirit of the times calls for disclosure, not concealment, in every field,” law professor Edson Sunderland, one of the drafters of the rules, wrote in 1925.\\n\\nWhen the original rules took effect in 1938, they required litigants to file key forms of pretrial discovery in court. This included witness depositions, which are interviews conducted under oath, and written answers and documents produced in response to requests for information from opposing parties.\\n\\nIt was because of these rules that a New Jersey plaintiff lawyer publicly filed the evidence log Motley later found in Newark. Motley then went back to court and filed a motion that compelled Raybestos to turn over the Sumner Simpson papers.\\n\\nTo address conflicts between the public interest in transparency and privacy rights, the rules allowed for protective orders. Originally, the rules allowed judges to decide on a case-by-case basis what deposition subjects could be shielded from scrutiny. The rules were refined in 1970 to specify that protective orders cover anything that could be a source of “annoyance, embarrassment, oppression,” including trade secrets, such as the formula for Coca-Cola.\\n\\nBy the late 1970s, some defendants sought protective orders, but the tactic was far from routine. A few courts had even begun to invalidate them, ruling that they ran afoul of the constitutional right to free speech by gagging plaintiffs and their lawyers from disclosing evidence of alleged malfeasance.\\n\\nBecause no protective order stopped Motley from quickly making the Sumner Simpson papers public, the documents had immediate impact beyond the courtroom. At the time, the asbestos industry was lobbying in Congress for a bill that would have mandated that the government pay some workers’ claims, essentially foisting the cost on taxpayers. The evidence that companies knew of the health risks for decades undercut their efforts, and the bill never advanced, said John Lawrence, former top staffer for then-Congressman George Miller. Within months of Motley’s discovery, the California Democrat featured the Sumner Simpson papers in hearings.\\n\\nHIGH COURT EFFECT\\n\\nSix years after Motley’s discovery, an unexpected Supreme Court decision ended the legal debate over protective orders and handed the defense bar a new weapon to beat back a rising wave of product-liability cases.\\n\\nThe case, Seattle Times v Rhinehart, had nothing to do with defective products. An obscure religious group called the Aquarian Foundation had obtained a protective order to keep its membership rolls secret during discovery in a lawsuit it had filed against the Seattle Times. The newspaper appealed to the high court, and the case caught Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr’s attention.\\n\\nDecades of work as a corporate defense lawyer had made Powell a rich man by the time President Richard Nixon named him to the high court in 1971. His clients had included the tobacco industry, and he had served as a director of cigarette maker Philip Morris, grappling at the time with the release of research showing that tobacco causes cancer.\\n\\nTwo months before his nomination, Powell’s passionately pro-business views informed a secret memo he wrote for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, titled “Attack on American Free Enterprise.” In it, he warned that American capitalism was under attack not just from “the Communists” and “New Leftists,” but also “perfectly respectable elements of society,” including “the college campus, the pulpit, the media, the intellectual,” as well as consumer advocate Ralph Nader.\\n\\nPowell urged the Chamber to build a roster of “attractive” speakers, scholars and media handlers to defend “our side.” Civil rights, labor and consumer rights groups were winning cases “often at business’ expense,” Powell wrote. “Other organizations and groups, recognizing this, have been far more astute in exploiting judicial action than American business.”\\n\\nOn the bench, Powell had been voicing concern about the growing burden of discovery on the U.S. legal system – particularly in complex cases – when Seattle Times v Rhinehart came before the court in 1983. As Powell read the clerk’s memo briefing the justices on the case, he saw the clerk had characterized all information received by a litigant in discovery as “protected in some way” under the First Amendment’s guarantees of free speech and thus more difficult to shield from the public. Powell marked that sentence with a question mark, according to the justice’s notes, housed at the Washington and Lee University Law School.\\n\\nHe and four colleagues voted to hear the case. A few days after oral arguments, eight of the nine justices voted to uphold a judge’s order blocking the discovery documents from public disclosure. The original discovery order was “extremely broad,” compelling the Aquarian Foundation to disclose its membership and sources of financial support, the justices ruled. Powell was assigned to write the opinion.\\n\\nOver the next three months, the justices debated how broadly the court should interpret the constitutionality of protective orders.\\n\\nAt one point, Justice William Brennan, one of the court’s liberal leaders, asked Powell to remove language from his draft opinion that flatly stated that pretrial depositions “are not public components of a civil trial.”\\n\\nPowell refused – and that single line of prose became part of the legal foundation for every protective order that followed.\\n\\nPowell’s language allowed the corporate defense bar to institutionalize protective orders in litigation across the country – shutting the public out of pretrial investigations as a matter of routine, even when the concealed discovery material could alert the public and regulators to potential danger.\\n\\nAnd protective orders have become an excuse for secrecy beyond discovery. Litigants routinely cite protective orders themselves as an argument for filing evidence in court under seal, thus ensuring that secrecy endures for the life of a case.\\n\\nJudges rarely object when litigants file evidence under seal. In 115 of the biggest mass torts over the past 20 years, judges sealed public health and safety information in about half of them. Most of the time, they failed to explain, as they are required to do, how the need for secrecy outweighed the public interest in transparency.\\n\\nNader said that during his 1960s investigation into safety issues around the Chevrolet Corvair sportscar – the work that made him famous – some of the best evidence came from depositions filed in court or obtained directly from lawyers suing General Motors Co, material that today would typically be hidden behind a protective order.\\n\\n“I’d call the lawyers and say I want the information. They’d say ‘Sure you can have it. Just pay copy costs and we’ll give it to you.’ “ The protective order that has since then become the norm, he said, “is an abuse of the judicial process. It limits the case for the plaintiff, tilts the case in favor of the defense and deprives the public of potential life-saving information … It’s censorship by another name.”\\n\\nTHE IDEAL CANDIDATE\\n\\nA year after the Supreme Court’s 1984 ruling in support of protective orders, a judge overseeing a wrongful death lawsuit against Ford Motor Co observed that the courts were being “bombarded by an ever increasing number of requests” for them.\\n\\nThe defense bar’s leading trade group, the Defense Research Institute, published a 1987 guide citing the Supreme Court’s decision and urging corporate litigators to seek protective orders “even where defense counsel can make no special claim of confidentiality.”\\n\\nIn a statement emailed to Reuters, DRI said it supports “the legal right of clients to seek protective orders when circumstances dictate.”\\n\\nThe drive to limit transparency wasn’t without pushback. Newspapers published investigations about the harms of court secrecy in individual cases in the late 1980s, and some elected officials, supported by the plaintiffs’ bar, began to resist. They devised what corporate lawyers called “the perennial Kohl bill,” which Senator Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat, introduced in the Senate for several years starting in the early 1990s. This proposed legislation – the precursor to the Sunshine in Litigation Act that Representative Nadler has pledged to reintroduce – sought to limit protective orders in cases that raise broader concerns about public health and safety.\\n\\nAt the same time, big companies were facing a litigation crisis in the states. Judges and juries in what plaintiff lawyers called “magic jurisdictions” that tended to favor consumers – in states like Texas, Mississippi, West Virginia and Illinois – were giving rise to “runaway verdicts,” recalled Tom Gottschalk, a onetime partner and now of counsel at Washington, D.C., law firm Kirkland & Ellis who served as general counsel of General Motors Co from 1994 to 2006.\\n\\nCorporations needed an advocate. Gottschalk and others had the ideal candidate.\\n\\nAl Cortese grew up in a working-class South Philadelphia neighborhood and earned a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1962. He made his name defending corporations in price-fixing cases, transforming himself into an impeccably tailored oenophile whose elegant appearance belied his attack-dog style in court.\\n\\nGottschalk had hired Cortese in 1984 to work on tort reform and other legislative issues. And by the 1990s, Cortese was leading what he called a “defense bar coalition” to influence state and federal policy makers to protect corporate privacy in product-liability litigation.\\n\\n‘LET ME GET VERY BASIC’\\n\\nTo Cortese – and the defense bar he represented – the idea that courts were hiding fatal secrets in their files was “nonsense.” Rather, Cortese viewed the drive for more transparency in the courts as a publicity ploy by plaintiff lawyers and the media. Public regulators, Cortese argued, had ample power to seek information needed to protect the public.\\n\\nIn an interview at his vineyard in Solvang, California, Cortese, now 82, segued easily into the aggressive style for which he is known as he explained the ideas behind his advocacy. At first, he laughed. “Let me get very basic,” he said. “What is the public right to observe the legal system? What is it?”\\n\\nCortese smacked the table on his poolside patio to underscore his point: “The right of the public to observe the court system means that they have a right to show up in court when there is a public trial. That is the extent of the public’s right to observe … Discovery and other information in court files – that is private information, and the right of privacy protects the information constitutionally.”\\n\\nTold that this wasn’t what U.S. appeals courts say, Cortese grew angry. “Yes it is!” he shouted. “Because you are focusing on, ‘In every case (judges) have to make this 123456 analysis.’ No. They. Don’t.”\\n\\nIn his September testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, however, Judge Story made clear that documents filed in court are presumed to be public and that judges are obliged to justify secrecy. “Only the most compelling reasons justify the nondisclosure of court records,” Story said. “A judge that grants a request to seal court records must set forth specific findings and conclusions that justify nondisclosure to the public — even if there is no objection to the motion to seal.”\\n\\nAs head of the defense bar lobbying team, Cortese set about batting back sunshine-in-litigation movements in the states, as well as furnishing the judges who presided over the federal civil rules advisory committee with academic opinions from top scholars who were friendly to the defense bar’s case.\\n\\nMost important were the writings of Arthur Miller, a professor then at Harvard Law School and one of the most widely respected U.S. legal experts. He became a darling of the secrecy set with a seminal 1991 law review article in which he argued that critics of court secrecy relied merely on anecdote. There was no data, he wrote, to prove that secrecy caused widespread harm. After their first meeting, Cortese sealed his friendship with Miller by sending him a case of mixed Barolo.\\n\\nArmed with the arguments of intellectuals like Miller, Cortese set his sights on Senator Kohl’s latest attempt to get his sunshine bill passed.\\n\\nIn a 1994 Senate hearing, Kohl argued passionately for transparency. “Because the courts are public institutions funded by hundreds of millions of tax dollars, and because justice is a public good, our court system must also do its part to help protect the public when appropriate,” he said. “Far too often, however, the court system allows vital information that is discovered in litigation – and which directly bears on public health and safety – to be covered up, to be shielded from mothers, fathers, and children whose lives are potentially at stake, and from the officials we have appointed to watch over our health and safety.”\\n\\nWhile debating Kohl’s bill, Congress sought the expertise of Judge Patrick Higginbotham, then chairman of the Federal Advisory Committee on Rules of Civil Procedure. Cortese said he got to know him, too. Higginbotham made many of the same arguments advanced by Cortese and Miller: Judges should be left to monitor protective orders themselves. Kohl’s bill would multiply discovery disputes in mass torts and would eat up too much of judges’ time. Republican Charles Grassley from Iowa repeated the same talking points while arguing against the bill on the Senate floor.\\n\\nHigginbotham said neither Cortese nor anyone else had undue influence on his views. Grassley declined to comment. His office noted that the senator voted for versions of Kohl’s bill in 2008 and 2011 that contained language to guard against “frivolous litigation.”\\n\\nKohl’s bill failed by two votes. It has been introduced in every Congress since, and has failed each time.\\n\\nINTO THE SIDE ROOMS\\n\\nBeyond the courts and Congress, Cortese and the cadre of secrecy proponents focused their efforts on the federal court rules committee.\\n\\nIn the late 1990s, the committee held a series of meetings to address the rules on what types of discovery material must be filed publicly – like the evidence log Motley found in New Jersey. Judges and court clerks had been complaining for years about the voluminous paperwork produced in discovery, particularly in mass torts. Clerks struggled to store and manage documents that could amount to millions of pages in a single case.\\n\\nAt first, the judges and lawyers on the committee were cautious. They remembered the backlash that 20 years earlier had sunk a proposal to bar deposition transcripts and other discovery documents from the courthouse. Back then, the New York Times editorial page and politicians like Senator Edward Kennedy had decried the so-called “Green Tree Rule” because they feared it would undermine transparency in the courts.\\n\\nThis time, facing scant opposition, the committee got tough, changing an early draft proposal that discovery material “need not” be filed to say it “must not.”\\n\\nWhen the committee gathered in Gleneden, Oregon, to vote on the rule, the room was stocked with lawyers and lobbyists representing companies facing product-liability lawsuits. Among them was Cortese, who had become a fixture at the meetings, testifying and advocating on issues dear to the defense bar.\\n\\nThe rules committee voted in favor of the change, and no members of Congress pushed back. Without fanfare or controversy, the amended “Rule 5d” took effect in 2000. Discovery was now closed off from the public for good.\\n\\nWhile some transparency proponents had pushed back on the proposed rule during the public comment period, no one from consumer advocacy groups, First Amendment organizations or media companies showed up for the committee’s vote, according to minutes of the discussion.\\n\\nThe impediment was resources, Nader said. Public Citizen, the consumer advocacy group he founded in 1971, filed testimony opposing the rule change, he said, but consumer groups were outgunned by their opponents, backed by corporations that could pay an army of expensive lawyers. “They wear you down,” he said. “There will be ten hearings, and all you can go to is two, if you can pay to travel.”\\n\\nPAST AND FUTURE\\n\\nBy the time he died in 2013 at age 68, Ron Motley was one of the most prominent plaintiff lawyers in the United States, renowned for his courtroom theatrics and lavish lifestyle. In addition to securing settlements for more than 100,000 asbestos victims, he also belonged to the team of lawyers that battled Big Tobacco, resulting in a record $246 billion settlement, and later represented victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\\n\\nSlideshow (7 Images)\\n\\nOne of the first things he did with the Sumner Simpson papers was to persuade a South Carolina judge to reopen the case of asbestos insulator Gordon Luther Barnett, who had died in his 60s from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer of the tissue surrounding the lungs and other organs that is caused by asbestos exposure.\\n\\nIn his decision to grant a new trial – the case was eventually settled – the judge cited the Sumner Simpson papers. The documents Motley found, he said, exposed “a conscious effort by the industry in the 1930s to downplay, or arguably suppress, the dissemination of information to employees and the public for fear of the promotion of lawsuits.”\\n\\nHis words, describing the tactics of businesses in decades past, were prescient of what was to play out time and again in the years ahead as secrecy enveloped the courts.

      "Document(text='President Trump is likely to enter the history books in a new category by the end of Wednesday: as the third president in U.S. history to have been impeached by the House. The votes on impeachment bring to an end the House’s months-long inquiry into whether Trump improperly pressured Ukraine to conduct investigations that would benefit him politically.\\n\\n[Follow live coverage of today`s impeachment debate and vote]\\n\\nHere’s how we got to this moment, and what you can expect in the Senate trial that comes next.\\n\\nFirst, what’s happening Wednesday?\\n\\nThe House will spend the day Wednesday debating the two impeachment articles on the House floor. The first article is for abuse of power, and the second is for obstructing the congressional inquiry.\\n\\nLawmakers allotted themselves six hours to debate, but procedural maneuvers mean the proceedings could go well into the evening. Once debate is over, they will vote separately on the two articles of impeachment. If just one passes with a majority vote, Trump will be impeached.\\n\\nThat won’t mean Trump is removed from office. The Senate determines whether that will happen. But let’s back up before we explain that.\\n\\nHow we got here\\n\\nThe events that led to the impeachment inquiry span years, and you can dig into them in this exhaustive timeline. Here’s a shorter recap.\\n\\nSpring and summer 2019\\n\\nThe alleged quid pro quo\\n\\nCongress and the Defense Department approved nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine in early 2019. Out of public view, diplomats were urging Trump to meet with Ukraine’s newly elected president in the Oval Office — a meeting the Ukrainians viewed as an important signal to Russia. But that meeting was pushed off, and the military aid was ordered stopped by the White House. In late July, Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, asking him to “do us a favor though” that included investigating his political opponents and the Biden family.\\n\\nIn August, a whistleblower filed a complaint about that call, alleging Trump had dangled a meeting with Zelensky in exchange for launching investigations into Joe Biden and his son Hunter and into a conspiracy theory about a Democratic National Committee server.\\n\\nSeptember\\n\\nImpeachment inquiry is launched\\n\\nThe Washington Post’s Editorial Board writes that it had been “reliably told” that Trump was pressuring Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. The existence of the whistleblower complaint is reported by The Post and other outlets. The White House releases a transcript of the call with Zelensky, and the whistleblower complaint becomes public. And Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announces the House will conduct an impeachment inquiry into Trump to see whether his actions on Ukraine render him unfit for office.\\n\\nOctober and November\\n\\nA public investigation\\n\\nThe investigation is underway. It happens behind closed doors at first. Then we get dramatic public testimony by White House aides, many of whom say Trump held up an Oval Office meeting with Ukraine’s president to get those investigations, and many of them say they believed Trump withheld the military aid for the same reason.\\n\\nTrump also blocked his top aides from complying with congressional subpoenas to testify in the investigation.\\n\\nDecember\\n\\nThe vote to impeach\\n\\nThe House Intelligence Committee released a report on the findings of the investigation, and based on that, the Judiciary Committee wrote up the two articles of impeachment the House will vote on Wednesday.\\n\\n[The articles of impeachment, explained]\\n\\nWhat the Constitution says about what happens next\\n\\nA president who has been impeached by the House can still serve as president. It’s up to the Senate to hold a trial to decide whether to remove him from office. The two other presidents impeached by the House, Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson, were both acquitted by the Senate.\\n\\nThe Constitution only says that the Senate has to hold a trial, with the senators sitting as jurors, House lawmakers serving as prosecutors known as managers and the chief justice of the United States presiding over it. They must take a public vote, and two-thirds of senators present must agree on whether to convict the president and thus remove him from office. But the Constitution doesn’t lay out exactly how to hold a trial.\\n\\nHow a Senate trial works\\n\\nRules the Senate approved in the 1980s give some guidelines, but the really important stuff — like whether to call witnesses and what kind of evidence to admit and how long to make it — is up to the senators themselves to decide. The only modern guide we have is the Clinton impeachment trial, which allowed no new evidence and only taped witness testimony of key witnesses. It was largely considered a successful example of bipartisan cooperation, as Republicans worked with Democrats to put together as fair a trial as possible.\\n\\nA majority of senators need to agree on the rules for Trump’s impeachment trial. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) will probably try to come to a compromise beforehand on what witnesses to call to avoid a big, dramatic battle during the trial. But they have vastly different views on how to do this. Schumer has said he wants people close to the president during this time, like Trump’s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, or former national security adviser John Bolton, to testify. The Post has reported McConnell wants no witnesses at all. Republicans are also feeling pressured by Trump, who appears ready to use the Senate trial to attack his political opponents and try to undermine his impeachment.\\n\\nOnce senators come to an agreement, we will have a start date for a trial. We expect that will be in January. Senators will start by taking an oath of impartiality and will work six days a week until they’ve voted on both articles of impeachment. If there are witnesses, senators can ask them questions in writing, which the presiding official, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., will read out loud. The president can choose his own lawyers, and they can cross-examine witnesses. The chief justice can overrule something that happens in the trial that he feels is out of line with the rules, but senators can overrule him with a vote.\\n\\nIf Trump is convicted on even one count, the Constitution says he has to be removed from office. Senators could take yet another vote to prevent him from running for office ever again.\\n\\nWhat is the likelihood of the Senate convicting Trump?\\n\\nIt’s low. House Republicans have displayed remarkable unity during the impeachment process — none of them are expected to vote for impeachment. Outside Congress, Trump remains popular among his base. Against that backdrop, it’s hard to see mass defections among Senate Republicans to override their party’s voters and kick the president out of office.\\n\\nA mass defection by members of his own party is what it would take to convict Trump and remove him from office. Twenty of the 53 Republican senators would need to join all Democratic-voting senators to reach the two-thirds supermajority the Constitution requires for impeachment. We count 14 who have expressed at least some level of concern with Trump’s behavior on Ukraine policy, but there are only three senators who have the track record of speaking out against Trump consistently: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah. In addition, it’s not a given that all Senate Democrats stay together. Someone like Joe Manchin III of West Virginia has crossed party lines before.\\n\\nSo, there likely aren’t enough senators to convict Trump as the evidence stands now. But there are enough senators in the middle of the political spectrum to put weight on Senate leaders to conduct a fair trial.\\n\\nWhat does the public say about impeaching Trump?\\n\\nAmericans started out skeptical of removing Trump from office, and after more than two months, they are split basically 50-50 on whether Trump should be impeached by the House and removed from office by the Senate. That includes the all-important independents, who are split, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.\\n\\nPOLL Washington Post-ABC News Poll Americans still split along partisan lines over impeachment Q: Based on what you know, do you think Congress should or should not impeach Trump and remove him from office?

      "Document(text='WASHINGTON — The Democratic-controlled House voted Tuesday to pass a $1.4 trillion government-wide spending package, handing President Donald Trump a victory on his U.S.-Mexico border fence while giving Democrats spending increases across a swath of domestic programs.\\n\\nThe hard-fought legislation also funds a record Pentagon budget and is serving as a must-pass legislative locomotive to tow an unusually large haul of unrelated provisions into law, including an expensive repeal of Obama-era taxes on high-cost health plans, help for retired coal miners, and an increase from 18 to 21 in nationwide legal age to buy tobacco products.\\n\\nThe two-bill package, some 2,371 pages long after additional tax provisions were folded in on Tuesday morning, was unveiled Monday afternoon and adopted less than 24 hours later as lawmakers prepared to wrap up reams of unfinished work against a backdrop of Wednesday’s vote on impeaching President Donald Trump.\\n\\nThe House first passed a measure funding domestic programs on a 297-120 vote. But one-third of the Democrats defected on a 280-138 vote on the second bill, which funds the military and the Department of Homeland Security, mostly because it funds Trump’s border wall project.\\n\\nThe spending legislation would forestall a government shutdown this weekend and give Trump steady funding for his U.S.-Mexico border fence, a move that frustrated Hispanic Democrats and party liberals. The year-end package is anchored by a $1.4 trillion spending measure that caps a difficult, months-long battle over spending priorities.\\n\\nThe mammoth measure made public Monday takes a split-the-differences approach that’s a product of divided power in Washington, offering lawmakers of all stripes plenty to vote for — and against. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was a driving force, along with administration pragmatists such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who negotiated the summertime budget deal that it implements.\\n\\nThe White House said Tuesday that Trump will sign the measure.\\n\\n”The president is poised to sign it and to keep the government open,” said top White House adviser Kellyanne Conway.\\n\\nThe bill would also increase the age nationwide for purchasing tobacco products from 18 to 21, and offers business-friendly provisions on export financing, flood insurance and immigrant workers.\\n\\nThe roster of add-ons grew over the weekend to include permanent repeal of a tax on high-cost “Cadillac” health insurance benefits and a hard-won provision to finance health care and pension benefits for about 100,000 retired union coal miners threatened by the insolvency of their pension fund. A tax on medical devices and health insurance plans would also be repealed permanently.\\n\\nThe deficit tab for the package grew as well with the addition of $428 billion in tax cuts over 10 years to repeal the three so-called “Obamacare” taxes, extend expiring tax breaks, and .\\n\\nThe legislation is laced with provisions reflecting divided power in Washington. Republicans maintained the status quo on several abortion-related battles and on funding for Trump’s border wall. Democrats controlling the House succeeded in winning a 3.1 percent raise for federal civilian employees and the first installment of funding on gun violence research after more than two decades of gun lobby opposition.\\n\\nLate Monday, negotiators unveiled a scaled-back $39 billion package of additional business tax breaks, renewing tax breaks for craft brewers and distillers, among others. The so-called tax extenders are a creature of Washington, a heavily lobbied menu of arcane tax breaks that are typically tailored to narrow, often parochial interests like renewable energy, capital depreciation rules, and race horse ownership. But a bigger effort to trade refundable tax credits for the working poor for fixes to the 2017 GOP tax bill didn’t pan out.\\n\\nThe sweeping legislation, introduced as two packages for political and tactical purposes, is part of a major final burst of legislation that’s passing Congress this week despite bitter partisan divisions and Wednesday’s likely impeachment of Trump. Thursday promises a vote on a major rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement, while the Senate is about to send Trump the annual defense policy bill for the 59th year in a row.\\n\\nThe core of the spending bill is formed by the 12 annual agency appropriations bills passed by Congress each year. It fills in the details of a bipartisan framework from July that delivered about $100 billion in agency spending increases over the coming two years instead of automatic spending cuts that would have sharply slashed the Pentagon and domestic agencies.\\n\\nThe increase in the tobacco purchasing age to 21 also applies to e-cigarettes and vaping devices and gained momentum after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signed on.\\n\\nOther add-ons include a variety of provisions sought by business and labor interests and their lobbyists in Washington.\\n\\nFor business, there’s a seven-year extension of the charter of the Export-Import Bank, which helps finance transactions benefiting U.S. exporters, as well as a renewal of the government’s terrorism risk insurance program. The financially troubled government flood insurance program would be extended through September, as would several visa programs for both skilled and seasonal workers.\\n\\nLabor won repeal of the so-called Cadillac tax, a 40% tax on high-cost employer health plans, which was originally intended to curb rapidly growing health care spending. But it disproportionately affected high-end plans won under union contracts, and Democratic labor allies had previously succeeded in temporary repeals.\\n\\nDemocrats controlling the House won increased funding for early childhood education and a variety of other domestic programs. They also won higher Medicaid funding for the cash-poor government of Puerto Rico, which is struggling to recover from hurricane devastation and a resulting economic downturn.\\n\\nWhile Republicans touted defense hikes and Democrats reeled off numerous increases for domestic programs, most of the provisions of the spending bill enjoy bipartisan support, including increases for medical research, combating the opioid epidemic, Head Start, and childcare grants to states.\\n\\nDemocrats also secured $425 million for states to upgrade their election systems, and they boosted the U.S. Census budget $1.4 billion above Trump’s request. They won smaller increases for the Environmental Protection Agency, renewable energy programs and affordable housing.\\n\\n“I am so proud that we are able to do so much good for children and families across the country and around the world,” said House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-N.Y.\\n\\nThe outcome in the latest chapter in the longstanding battle over Trump’s border wall awards Trump with $1.4 billion for new barriers — equal to last year’s appropriation — while preserving Trump’s ability to use his budget powers to tap other accounts for several times that amount. That’s a blow for liberal opponents of the wall but an acceptable trade-off for pragmatic-minded Democrats who wanted to gain $27 billion in increases for domestic programs and avert the threat of simply funding the government on autopilot.\\n\\n“Many members of the CHC will vote against it,” said Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairman Joaquin Castro, D-Texas. “It’s true that there are a lot of good things and Democratic victories in the spending agreement. I think everybody appreciates those. What members of the Hispanic Caucus are concerned with is the wall money, the high level of detention beds, and most of all with the ability of the president to transfer money both to wall and to detention beds in the future.”\\n\\nThe bill also extends a longstanding freeze on lawmakers’ pay despite behind-the-scenes efforts this spring to revive a cost of living hike approved years ago but shelved during the Obama administration.\\n\\nBecause dozens of Democrats oppose the border wall, Pelosi paired money for the Department of Homeland Security with the almost $700 billion Pentagon budget, which won more than enough GOP votes to offset Democratic defections.\\n\\nThe coal miners’ pension provision, opposed by House GOP conservatives like Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., had the backing of Trump and powerful Senate GOP Leader McConnell in addition to Democrats like Pelosi and Sen.

      "Document(text='LINCOLN, R.I. — The line for the ticket windows at a Rhode Island casino’s sportsbook stretched to the door on one afternoon last month: Gamblers were cashing in their winnings from betting on the victorious New England Patriots the day before and placing new wagers for that night.\\n\\n“This happens pretty much every Monday,” said Craig Sculos, vice president and general manager at Twin River Casino Hotel, just north of Providence. “The building takes on this unique rhythm.”\\n\\nThe casino adds extra staff at its sportsbook on Mondays. And since it’s the only New England state that has launched sports betting, Rhode Island is the closest place for Patriots fans to legally bet on their team.\\n\\nThis could be the scene in more states in the years ahead. Legalized sports betting has caught on quickly since a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2018 allowed for it to be legalized in every state; 2020 will be a test of whether that rapid expansion continues.\\n\\nSports wagers can be made legally in 13 states, while sportsbooks have been legalized in another half-dozen — including Colorado — where they’re not yet running. In all, about one-third of the nation’s population lives in a state where legal sports betting has been authorized.\\n\\nWHERE IT’S HAPPENING\\n\\nIn 2019, the first legal sports bets were made in Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, New York and Oregon, joining eight states where betting was already running.\\n\\nVoters in Colorado and lawmakers in Illinois, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Tennessee also legalized it this year, but the programs have not yet launched. The same is true in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. A bill that cleared the Michigan Legislature this month also is expected to be signed into law.\\n\\nThe next sportsbook to open could be in New Hampshire. The state’s lottery commission approved having DraftKings, one of the biggest players in sports betting, set up mobile wagering as soon as January.\\n\\nWHAT’S AHEAD IN 2020\\n\\nWhether to legalize sports betting is expected to be debated in 2020 in a number of states, including Connecticut, Massachusetts, Missouri and Ohio — all states where efforts this year fell short.\\n\\nIn Georgia, state Sen. Brandon Beach has been pushing for years to legalize horse racing as a way to promote economic development. He’s now trying to get momentum for a constitutional amendment to allow casino betting, horse racing and sports betting in a state that doesn’t have any legalized gambling outside the lottery. He wants to use the revenue to beef up a lottery-funded college scholarship program.\\n\\n“If we’re going to look at sports betting, we’ve got to look at the whole thing,” said Beach, a Republican.\\n\\nThe Georgia effort is getting pushback from the Faith and Freedom Coalition, which has its headquarters there. The socially conservative group says all forms of gambling can lead to addiction, bankruptcy and crime.\\n\\n“It causes all of us to pay, whether or not we play,” spokeswoman Virginia Galloway said.\\n\\nTHE BIGGEST STATES\\n\\nSo far, the three most populous states — California, Texas and Florida — have not legalized sportsbooks.\\n\\nRelated Articles Cardinals’ Josh Shaw suspended for betting on NFL games\\n\\nBut the industry is watching them, along with the fourth-largest, New York, where bets can be made only in person at four upstate casinos located far from the New York City area’s massive population. Whether those four casinos can add online betting without an amendment to the state constitution is under debate.\\n\\nIn California, a group of Native American tribes has proposed a ballot measure for next year. The proposal would cut out rival card rooms and would not provide for online bets. Lawmakers also can propose their own plan for the ballot.\\n\\nLike in New York, advocates in Florida disagree about whether legalizing sports betting would require voter approval. In Texas, it’s clear that a constitutional amendment would be needed. A bill to put one on the ballot didn’t get far in 2019, and the legislature isn’t scheduled to meet in 2020.\\n\\n“For those big states, it just takes longer,” said Jake Williams, a vice president at Sportradar, a company that contracts with sports leagues for services including providing data.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nAs with other gambling offerings, states vary widely on what they’re allowing.\\n\\nIn New Mexico, lawmakers never explicitly allowed sportsbooks, but two Native American tribal casinos are offering it, with bets being taken only on site. In Arkansas, bets are being taken only at Oaklawn Racing Casino Resort.\\n\\nBy contrast, bets can be made practically everywhere in the nine states where online sports betting is happening. Online wagering has been allowed but not started in another five states plus the District of Columbia.\\n\\nBut the programs work in different ways. In New Jersey and Indiana, anyone who is eligible and within the state’s border can sign up online and start betting. In Iowa, Nevada and some other states, bettors must first register in person at casinos.\\n\\nTax rates range from less than 7% of the books’ winnings in Iowa and Nevada to more than 30% in Pennsylvania. In states such as Delaware and Oregon, where the lottery owns sports betting, the state’s share is even higher.\\n\\nIn some states, only casinos or racetracks can apply for licenses; in others, online companies such as FanDuel and DraftKings can apply for licenses without partnering with casinos or tracks.\\n\\n“We’re seeing an incredible amount of diversity,” said Chris Grove, a managing director with Eilers & Krejcik Gaming. “I suspect that will persist.”\\n\\nHOW IT’S DOING\\n\\nFrom July (the start of most states’ fiscal years) through October, sports betting generated about $50 million in state tax revenue across the country according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the states.\\n\\nNew Jersey accounted for more than $15 million of that, making sports betting more lucrative for the state than in Nevada, which lost its monopoly after the Supreme Court decision. But states including Rhode Island and West Virginia are falling short of their own projections for revenue.\\n\\nRhode Island state Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, a Democrat, the biggest advocate for legalized sports betting in the legislature, is unsure whether the state will hit its $22.7 million target and worries about potential competition from nearby states. But even if it falls short of projections, sports betting is bringing the state revenue it didn’t have before, Ruggerio added.\\n\\nSculos, the Rhode Island casino executive, views sports betting as another amenity rather than a windfall for casinos or the states where they’re located. But it has drawn people to the casino who had never before visited.\\n\\nSculos visited the sportsbook on a recent Sunday when it was full of gamblers clapping and cheering.\\n\\n“Because all of the television screens are lit up for the NFL games, you have no idea what they’re clapping and cheering about, but they were having just the best time,” he said. “That environment is really unique. You see it a little bit at a craps table and a roulette table, but craps might have 10, 12, 15 people standing around it. We could have over 200 people here at once. … It’s a fun place to be.”\\n\\nMulvihill reported from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

      "Document(text='The wait is over. Basketball season is here.\\n\\nAs always, it starts with a bang. Ranked teams will show their worth, while some rivals will get an early leg up in divisional races.\\n\\nNJ.com took a look at the best games from the first four days of the 2019-20 season.\\n\\nThursday, Dec. 19\\n\\nPlainfield at Union, 4\\n\\nUnion defeated a young Plainfield squad in coach Michael Gordon’s debut, 53-49, in last year’s season opener, though was propelled largely by seniors that day. The Farmers, who also defeated the Cardinals in their second meeting, will be looking for leadership from junior forwards Jakim Edmond and Ronn Flodd and senior guard Andrew Sanborn, the star QB from the school’s sectional-championship football squad. Senior point guard Justus Williams, sophomore guard Jamarques Lawrence and junior swing Daron Montgomery lead the way for Plainfield. This is the first of two games in the St. Jude Classic.\\n\\nTimber Creek at Washington Township, 5:30\\n\\nTeams looking to contend for titles in their respective divisions, this Olympic Conference matchup is the season opener for both. Timber Creek is the favorite in the Patriot and is led by the senior trio of Eric Benjamin, Justin Bladen and Demetrius Paynter. The Minutemen should be in the American mix, with returning starters Drew Amos, Rich Santos and Curt Parker expected to increase their production this season.\\n\\nLinden vs. Newark University at Union, 5:30\\n\\nAn experienced Linden squad looking to rebound from a 12-14 season takes on a University club that returns standouts Justin Harcourt, Bakir Cleveland and several others from an 18-6 team that edged the Tigers, 41-38, in their early-season meeting last year. Linden returns steady scorers Amir Williams and Nashawn Holmes and also flaunts size in the lane with 6-10 senior Yasin Willock. This is the second game of the St. Jude Classic at the Lou Rettino Gymnasium.\\n\\nOlympus Prep at No. 2 Patrick School, 6\\n\\nThe No. 1 recruit in the class of 2021 Jonathan Kuminga will make his debut for The Patrick School on Thursday night. He will be joined by an absolutely loaded lineup featuring Noah Farrakhan, Kirk Parsons, Bendji Pierre, Samson Johnson, Zarique Nutter and Bretner Mutombo. Anthony Thomas, Julius Elerbee and Javon Adams head a strong group at Olympus Prep.\\n\\nMarist at Snyder, 6\\n\\nSnyder will be seeking out some revenge after topping Marist, 51-41. in the season opener last year and then losing two straight to the Royal Knights, including in the Hudson County Tournament quarterfinals. Well-established senior forward Corey Manning-Floyd (20.3 ppg. as a junior) and sophomore point guard Shy’heed Jenkins-Floyd pace the attack for Snyder. Marist sports a deep backcourt led by Mike Jackson, Keith Mency and Emmanuel Toha.\\n\\nBurlington Township at No. 18 Trenton Catholic, 6:30\\n\\nThese two teams will waste no time setting the bar in the Burlington County League Liberty Division. Burlington Township, which lost to Wall in last year’s Central Jersey Group 3 final, is led by four-year starting guard JohnPaul Oluwadare and third-year starting forward Emmanuel Ayetigbo. Trenton Catholic earned a share of the division crown last season with Group 3 state champion Moorestown. Jamir Watkins, a 6-7 guard and Virginia Commonwealth commit, is expected to carry a big part of the load for the Iron Mikes.\\n\\nFair Lawn at Northern Highlands, 7\\n\\nLast year these two met on opening day with Fair Lawn pulling out a 46-45 victory. Northern Highlands went on to finish 10-15, while Fair Lawn went the other direction with a 22-4 season.

Out of the Philadelphia Public League, Simon Gratz is 3-0 overall. Camden, which fell to Haddonfield in overtime in last year’s South Jersey Group 2 final, is led by Kentucky-bound senior forward Lance Ware. The Panthers also featured a dynamite junior tandem in Jerome Brewer and Ta’Quan Woodley, as well as freshman sensation D.J. Wagner. Expectations are through the roof and starting the season strong under first-year coach Rick Brunson is a major key for Camden.\\n\\nHaddon Heights at West Deptford, 4\\n\\nThe first of two regular-season meetings, this Colonial Liberty contest will set the tone in the division race. Te’Sean Pressley and Isaiah Turner are two of four returning starters for Haddon Heights and expected to be impact players at both ends of the floor. West Deptford is led by a senior tandem of its own in MJ Iraldi and Brandon Ratcliffe. Ratcliffe is closing in on 1,000 career points.\\n\\nNo. 6 Newark East Side at West Side, 4\\n\\nEast Side lost only five games all last season en route to the Group 4 state title, and two of them came against a West Side club that may have difficulty repeating that achievement. The Roughriders lost every starter from that club, while East Side returns with senior forward Mikah Johnson, senior guard Gabriel Olaniyi and several other experienced hands.\\n\\nSouth Brunswick at Old Bridge, 5\\n\\nSenior forward Devin Strickland, senior guard Justin Carbone and junior guard Tyrell Marchison direct a South Brunswick team that returns practically every regular from a 12-13 team that demonstrated marked improvement throughout the season.

A younger Knights crew this season will call upon seniors Sean Williams, Ryan DeLaCuesta and Jaden Caban for guidance.\\n\\nMarlboro at Christian Brothers, 5:30\\n\\nInjuries struck at the worst times for Marlboro last season, but despite that it showed a ton of potential. Now it will look to turn that potential into success and that starts with a tough opening matchup against Christian Brothers. Alex Ratner and Jonathan Spatola will led a strong group of returners for Marlboro. For CBA, Colin Farrell, Ryan Mabrey and Mike White will key a young yet experienced squad. Christian Brothers defeated Marlboro twice last season.\\n\\nNo. 11 Hudson Catholic at Union City, 6\\n\\nA senior-dominated Union City team fell to Hudson Catholic twice in the 2018-19 regular season before exacting surprising revenge , 58-56, in the Hudson County Tournament semifinals. The Soaring Eagles would go on to top Marist for the title. Sophomore guard Maurice Odum, Diohanny Guzman and Brandon Marquez will lead new-look Union City. Returning regulars Zion Cruz and Justin Glover will team up with St. Mary (Eliz.) transfer Phil Brown to spark the attack for Hudson Catholic.\\n\\nLenape at No. 15 Camden Catholic, 7\\n\\nTwo of the better teams in the Olympic Conference open their seasons in an inter-division matchup. A contender in the American Division as well as South Jersey Group 4, Lenape returns three starters in forward Anthony Cortese along with guards Connor Kennedy and Derek Simpson. Camden Catholic enters the season as the defending South Jersey Non-Public A and Olympic National champion. The Irish return a pair of junior starters in Zach Hicks and Lucas Dunn.\\n\\nDelbarton at Mendham, 7\\n\\nSenior forward Dean Smith and senior guards Jerry Jabbour and Isaiah Washington are returning starters for a Delbarton squad that edged Mendham in two close battles last season and reached the semifinals of the Morris County Tournament. Mendham lost three starters from its 14-10 squad, but does still have senior guards Jesse Hafemeister, who scored 19 points in both encounters last season, and T.J. Garrison. Veteran coach Bill Connolly makes his debut with Mendham after moving over from Morristown.\\n\\nRamapo at Pascack Valley, 7\\n\\nThis year’s Ramapo team is going to have a much different look. Max Pernetti is the lone returning starter from a squad that reached the Group 3 final. It will run into a Pascack Valley squad that has struggled lately but brings back some veterans in Austin Koolery, Nate Dedrick, Ryan Thomas and John Noone.\\n\\nAndrew Mills | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com Trey Patterson (3) of Rutgers Prep secures a key rebound in the fourth quarter as Rutgers Prep stuns Bridgewater-Raritan with a buzzer-beater to win, 53-52, on Thursday, Jan. 25, 2018.

It brings back a nice group featuring Anthony Corbo, A`Khoury Lyde and John O`Reilly as it looks to take that next step in the tough Big North, United Division. Clifton reached the Passaic County Tournament final last year but will be doing a bit of rebuilding after graduating four of its top five scorers. The only one that remains is senior center Edward Perez, who will be the team`s leader.\\n\\nNo. 5 Elizabeth vs. Neptune at Dunn Center, 3:20\\n\\nLocked-and-loaded Elizabeth looks to be a force again as it enters the year the favorite to win a Group 4 championship. Jordan Price and D.J. Watkins highlight a strong group of returners from last year’s squad that reached the North 2, Group 4 final and the Union County Tournament semifinals. For Neptune junior guard Sam Fagan is making his return to the court after an injury cut his season short last year. This will be a nice measuring stick game for a Neptune squad trying to make some noise down the shore.\\n\\nNo. 3 Wildwood Catholic vs. Notre Dame at Ocean City, 7\\n\\nThe top team in South Jersey, Wildwood Catholic takes the floor against the Irish in the final game of the night at the Ocean City PBA Tip-Off Weekend showcase.

Both teams are coming off successful 2018-19 campaigns and this should be a nice test for both. Wayne Valley lost its top five scorers and will look to guards Derek Sandowick and Kevin Devins to step into everyday roles. For Saddle River Day, Connor Cyran had a team-high 17.5 ppg last year. He will be joined by returning starters Sebastian Giannotti and Dylan Besserer.\\n\\nJohn Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com GSB #1 William Soucie holds the ball as Gill St. Bernard`s faces Newark East Side in the PrimeTime Shootout at East Orange Campus High School. 2/11/18 East Orange, N.J.\\n\\nNo. 8 Gill St. Bernard’s vs. Marist at Dunn Center, 3:20\\n\\nThe defending Somerset County Tournament champs will be tested by Marist in this one. With Paul Mulcahy over at Rutgers, Gill will look to seniors Will Soucie - a North Alabama recruit - and Zach Martini - a Princeton recruit - to lead the group. Both versatility players have good size and can use their size to make things happen inside. Marist has a nice group this year with guards Keith Mency and Emmanuel Toha as well as 6-9 forward Manny Exauce leading the way.\\n\\nNo. 7 Bergen Catholic vs. No. 12 St. Thomas Aquinas at Dunn Center, 5\\n\\nSt. Thomas Aquinas has some serious hype and its loaded roster is the reason why.

The CDLE describes the proposed COMPS Order as “the source of critical Colorado wage rights and responsibilities beyond those provided by federal law,” including eligibility for the state minimum wage rate. While the regulations are not yet final and will not be effective until March 2020, we want to notify you of the two major anticipated reforms.\\n\\nFirst, the COMPS Order will be much more broad-reaching by presumptively covering all Colorado employees, regardless of industry, unless specifically exempted. (The prior Minimum Wage Order only covered employees in four industries: retail and service; food and beverage; commercial support service; and health and medical. The COMPS Order is intended to eliminate confusion caused by these categories.) This means, for example, that an employer that was not previously required to pay the state minimum wage to certain employees, whether because of the employer’s industry or the employee’s job duties, will now be required to pay the state minimum wage rate to all employees unless one of several delineated exemptions applies. Additionally, the COMPS Order clarifies that localities may set higher wage and hour law standards than the state or federal government—as Denver recently did by setting its own higher minimum wage rate to become effective on January 1, 2020.\\n\\nSecond, the COMPS Order establishes a new minimum salary threshold for white-collar employee overtime exemptions. That threshold will be $42,500 beginning on July 1, 2020 (higher than the federal salary level of $35,568 scheduled to be effective January 1, 2020), and it will rise by $3,000 per year until it reaches $57,500 in 2026.\\n\\nThe COMPS Order also contains revisions or clarifications to various other wage and hour laws, including those related to rest periods, deductions, meal and lodging credits, overtime calculations, and postings.

      "Document(text='USA TODAY\\n\\nBOSTON — Waistlines of Americans continue to get wider, and unless habits change at a grand scale, obesity will soon be the norm.\\n\\nNearly half of the U.S. population is projected to be obese by 2030, with a quarter having severe obesity by that time, according to a staggering new study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\\n\\nIn 10 years, 29 states are projected to have populations that are a majority obese, the study found, while all states will have populations that are at least 35% obese.\\n\\n\"Obesity is going up in terms of the number of people who have it, and the degree or severity of obesity is going up,\" said Zachary Ward, a Harvard programmer and analyst who served as lead author of the report to be published today in the New England Journal of Medicine.\\n\\nMore:Obesity continues rise in US, but these counties are the least obese in each state\\n\\nRight now, 40% of Americans adults are obese and 18% suffer from what is considered severe obesity. The study predicts those numbers will balloon by 2030 to 49% and 24% respectively.\\n\\nResearchers predict severe obesity to be highest among women, non-Hispanic black adults and people who earn annual incomes below $50,000 per year. Among men, 21% are expected to be severely obese by 2030, compared to 28% of women.\\n\\n\"It used to be a rare condition,\" Ward said of the severe category, \"but it`s increasing and will soon be the most common condition nationwide we find for women, for non-Hispanic black adults and for adults who earn less than $50,000 per year.\"\\n\\nState-Level Trends in Obesity with Zach Ward\\n\\nObesity versus severe obesity\\n\\nObesity is measured by body mass index, BMI, which is calculated by dividing a person`s weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. A BMI of above 30 is considered obese; above 35 is considered severely obese, which typically means having 100 pounds or more of excess weight.\\n\\n\"People are at a much higher risk (with severe obesity) for diseases like diabetes, heart disease, some types of cancer and mortality as well,\" Ward said. \"There`s big health implications.\"\\n\\nObesity is expected to reach the highest levels in the South, where it already leads the nation. Ward pointed to the South`s higher populations of African-Americans and low-income subgroups, which are both more likely to be obese.\\n\\nStates with the highest projected 2030 obesity rates are: Oklahoma, 58.4%; Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, 58.2%; West Virginia, 57.5%; and Louisiana, 57.2%.\\n\\nThe highest populations of severe obesity are projected to be in Arkansas, 32,6%; Oklahoma, 31.7%; and Mississippi, 31.7%.\\n\\nStates or districts with the lowest projected obesity rates are: District of Columbia, 35.3%; Colorado, 38.2 %; Hawaii, 41.3%; California, 41.5; Massachusetts, 42.3%; and New York, 42.8%.\\n\\nResearchers conducted the study by reviewing data from 6.2 million people who took part in phone surveys on behavior risks carried out by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention between 1993 and 2016.\\n\\nPeople typically self-report greater height and lower weight than what`s accurate. Ward said researchers compared self-reported figures to the actual measured statistics in each state. They used trends from that data to project future obesity rates for specific states, income levels, and sub-populations.\\n\\nAlthough the Harvard study did not identify causes for the rapid spike in obesity, health experts say Americans are eating more food high in calories and fat and are exercising less as more work has shifted from outside to the desk.\\n\\n\"It`s clear that we`re not going to be able to treat our way out of this epidemic. Losing weight is difficult,\" Ward said. \"It`s hard for clinicians to treat obesity. I think prevention really has to be the key to combating this epidemic.\"\\n\\nHe said \"real structural changes, policy changes\" at the local, state and national level are needed to reverse the obesity trends.\\n\\n\"Individual behavior change has not worked so far. We`ve been talking about obesity and telling people to lose weight for years, but it keeps going up year after year.\"\\n\\nReach Joey Garrison and on Twitter @joeygarrison.

      "Document(text='In this edition: Seven things to watch tonight, the impeachment risk for Democrats who supported it, and explaining what the heck is going on with the Affordable Care Act.\\n\\nI filed from a mall today, as is the Los Angeles custom, and this is The Trailer.\\n\\nCrews set up for Thursday`s Democratic debate as the House votes on impeachment on Wednesday night. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\\n\\nLOS ANGELES – No other Democratic debate had such high barriers to entry. No other debate came so close to collapsing, with a labor dispute at Loyola Marymount University resolved just 55 hours before the candidates walk onstage: former vice president Joe Biden; Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.); Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.); South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.); investor Tom Steyer; and businessman Andrew Yang.\\n\\nFollow The Post`s debate coverage here.\\n\\nAnd no other debate will have faced such a struggle to break through. Today`s three-hour, seven-candidate contest, hosted by PBS NewsHour and Politico, will unfold right after an impeachment vote that could change the race`s trajectory. It won`t include Mike Bloomberg, who in one month has already spent more than any other Democrat on campaign advertising. It`s been sniped at for weeks because four of the nonwhite candidates still in the race did not get the poll numbers needed to qualify.\\n\\nYet, with all that, this is set to be the longest sustained grilling of the primary, with the most time for individual candidates to explain themselves or argue with each other. Here`s what could come up.\\n\\nThe impeachment sacrifice. Three of the Democrats on the stage tonight – Sanders, Warren and Klobuchar – are likely to spend some part of January in an impeachment trial. That has loomed over their campaigns for weeks and given each of them a topic that allows them to demonstrate total selflessness.\\n\\n\"I took an oath of office, as did everyone in Congress and part of that oath of office is the basic principle that no one is above the law,\" Warren said last month in New Hampshire. \"If the House goes forward and sends an impeachment over to the Senate, then I will be there for the trial.”\\n\\n\"I guess I’m just going to have to try to be in Washington, D.C., in Des Moines, Iowa, and Concord, N.H., at the same time,\" Sanders joked to ABC News last week.\\n\\n\"I meet whatever obstacle is put in front of me,\" Klobuchar said this month on CNN. \"This is more than an obstacle. It`s my constitutional obligation.\"\\n\\nImpeachment has been one of the single most unifying issues in these debates, giving each candidate 60 seconds to deliver the anti-Trump arguments that their voters want to hear. It`s a layup for the senators in the race and a test for Biden, whose strength in rounds about impeachment has been shaped by whether moderators ask about Republican attacks on his son Hunter`s work for a Ukrainian company.\\n\\nIf the subject is Trump and electability, Biden does well; if it`s about the details of the Hunter Biden saga, he can struggle. But his fellow Democrats have never shown much interest in exploiting that.\\n\\nMedicare-for-All Part VI: Medicare`s Revenge. Strange, but true: Warren`s campaign had wanted more questions about health care at the last debate. In November, Warren released a series of tax increases that could pay for Medicare-for-all, then a plan to transition over to a single-payer health-care system.\\n\\nBoth plans differed from the approach of Sanders. Both plans had support from Medicare-for-all advocates, though some had already endorsed Sanders. The short version: Warren would implement much of Medicare-for-all before scheduling a vote to ban duplicative insurance, while Sanders would try to pass the entire legislation, with the benefits and the ban, in his first year.\\n\\nIt`s a thorny argument but not too hard to explain, and Warren has been explaining it succinctly at campaign stops. Most voters haven`t heard it. As recently as this weekend, Warren was still getting questions about how her plan differs from Buttigieg`s \"Medicare for all who want it,\" as voters and reporters remain more fixated on why she altered her position than what the position is. (Warren`s plan would create a universal system with no deductible, and Buttigieg`s would not.)\\n\\nWarren and her allies have been unable to exploit Buttigieg`s position, that a slower transition that leaves private insurance untouched would get to Medicare-for-all, eventually. She now focuses on how fast presidential action in 2021 would get that process started more quickly. How will the candidates who support a public option (Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar) rebut that? Buttigieg has recently talked more about how single-payer would disrupt middle-class insurance jobs; Biden and Klobuchar tend to focus on the plan`s steep path through Congress.\\n\\nAll of them have the option of trying to divide Warren from Sanders, which did not happen in previous debates. Even as some of Sanders`s surrogates have attacked Warren`s revised plan, he has largely refused to. Both Sanders and Warren are far more comfortable attacking Buttigieg, whose work on health insurance at McKinsey & Co. was not known until after the last debate and who succumbed to pressure to release the names of donors, which include some drug company executives.\\n\\nHow to buy an election. The Democratic primary started with a truce on campaign spending – no super PACs, no self-funding. That deal fell apart in the past few months, as Biden gave the nod to a super PAC and Bloomberg leaped into the race with an eight-figure TV buy. And it`s hardly come up as an issue in the debates. Biden`s super PAC decision, for example, led to exactly zero questions when Democrats met last month.\\n\\nWarren and Sanders want that to change. They have been more aggressive recently in attacking Bloomberg`s largesse and the influence of big donors in the Buttigieg and Biden campaigns.\\n\\n\"Why would many, many billionaires be contributing to candidates if they didn`t think they were getting something out of it?\" Sanders asked, in a new CBS News interview.\\n\\n\"We know that one Democratic candidate walked into a room of wealthy donors this year to promise that `nothing would fundamentally change` if he’s president,\" Warren said last week in New Hampshire. \"We know that another calls the people who raise a quarter million dollars for him his `National Investors Circle,` and he offers them regular phone calls and special access.\" She was talking about Biden, then Buttigieg.\\n\\nButtigieg and Warren have been at this for weeks, with him channeling the frustrations of a lot of Warren critics: She came up with her no-fundraisers policy only after she began running for president. \"The thing about these purity tests is the people issuing them can’t even meet them,\" Buttigieg told The Washington Post`s Robert Costa last week.\\n\\nEverybody loves Bernie. You can`t say Bernie Sanders has gotten off easy in this primary. He`s dismissed as unelectable on cable news panels; analysis of polls where he`s done well has sometimes ignored him completely; his heart attack, in October, was covered as the potential end for his campaign.\\n\\nAnd yet, for strategic reasons, Sanders has rarely been attacked onstage and never attacked by name in paid media. Even when the attacks have come, they`ve tended to lump him and Warren together as the candidates who cause \"electability\" night sweats. (\"Both Senators Warren and Sanders want to replace Obamacare with Medicare-for-all,\" moderator George Stephanopoulos said in the September debate, giving Biden a cue to defend the 44th president`s legacy.)\\n\\nSanders`s improvement in recent polls hasn`t changed the way most rivals think of him: that he has a high floor of support but a low ceiling, pushed by frustrations about his long 2016 primary bid, his age and his health. They previously praised him for honesty as a way of criticizing Warren on health care; they could now accentuate how he has no billionaire donors (Warren has a couple) or how he`s never had corporate clients (she did, as legal adviser). That`s left Sanders with some of the highest favorable ratings in the field. Will he benefit, once again, from candidates turning their fire elsewhere?\\n\\nDoes everybody still hate Pete? In November, the Indiana mayor got off relatively easy: Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) tangled with him on war powers, and Klobuchar got a chance to repeat her rhetorical question of why a man with a short résumé gets to be a top presidential candidate. But most of the candidates` weapons went unused, from Buttigieg`s bungled roll-out of a \"Douglass Plan\" for black America to the aforementioned support from big donors.\\n\\nButtigieg was the first Democrat to benefit from a negative attack in these debates, after he ribbed Warren for being initially unable to say whether she`d raise taxes to pay for Medicare-for-all. Warren has kept her high favorable ratings with Democrats, in part, by swatting away attempts to get her to argue with other candidates. The candidate to watch: Klobuchar, whose path to relevance in Iowa depends on pulling voters away from both Buttigieg and Warren.\\n\\nIs that all there is? Congress may soon approve the USMCA, an update to NAFTA that both Democrats and the Trump administration call a new standard for trade negotiations. A National Defense Authorization Act just passed, with a go-ahead for a \"Space Force\" but no restraints on presidential war power. Neither topic has gotten much attention in a debate this year. Both could show the real differences between these candidates, and how they would or wouldn`t tack away from positions that hurt the party in 2016.\\n\\nThe question is whether moderators go there, on topics that haven`t been sparking debates on the trail. Sanders, in particular, has been comfortable pointing out a Biden voting record on war, taxes and trade that directly clashes with his own. In these debates, typically, he makes a few criticisms and they`re never followed up.\\n\\nThe other two. Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer just barely qualified for the debates, with mixed-to-negative reactions from Democrats. The two outsiders have little in common: Steyer`s a billionaire, while Yang has one of the most cash-poor campaigns. But both will get more time to speak than in any previous debate, and both have grown comfortable attacking the better-résuméd candidates as politicians more concerned with ideology than on fixing the political system.\\n\\n\"None of them has a private-sector track record of creating jobs,\" Steyer has said of the leading Democratic candidates.\\n\\nYang, who has broadened his campaign beyond his initial pitch for a universal basic income, is also getting a bit more comfortable in criticizing his rivals, pointing out his crossover support from Republicans. But neither is playing by the same rules as the five candidates with elected experience.\\n\\nREADING LIST\\n\\n\"Impeachment split screen: As House votes in Washington, Trump rallies in Michigan,\" by Josh Dawsey and Ashley Parker\\n\\nSeeking solace from the crowds on one of his presidency`s worst days.\\n\\n\"How Harvard made Pete Buttigieg the moderate that progressives love to hate,\" by Michael Kruse\\n\\nThe making of the Democratic leadership class, as seen through one candidate.\\n\\n\"Elizabeth Warren to hold private meeting with tribal leaders Sunday in effort to atone for past claims,\" by Annie Linskey\\n\\nDealing with the issue that nearly ended her career as she arrives in Oklahoma.\\n\\n\"The impeachment trial could keep senators in D.C. at the height of the campaign.

But we haven`t seen any evidence of the impeachment drama moving numbers from where they were this summer, with Republicans trailing the generic ballot outside the margin of error. The seven-point margin here is exactly what it was before hearings began and, more ominously for Republicans, exactly what it was in the weeks before the 2018 midterms. Most swing seats are a bit more Republican-leaning than the country at large.\\n\\nYou are reading The Trailer, the newsletter that brings the campaign trail to your inbox three times a week. Not a regular subscriber?\\n\\nON THE TRAIL\\n\\nFrom left, Reps. Adam Schiff, Carolyn Maloney, Jerry Nadler and Eliot Engel flank Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\\n\\nLOS ANGELES – Jennifer Barbosa walked from door to door, dropping off fliers with a message most Angelenos did not want to hear: She could help rid them of Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.). An independent who did not vote in the 2016 election, she was offering to replace the congressman who`d presided over the key hearings in the impeachment of President Trump with someone who might, for example, pay more attention to the problem of undelivered mail.\\n\\n\"Hundreds of constituents have contacted them about it, but they`re not addressing it,\" Barbosa said, referring to Schiff`s office. \"Now, contrast that with — I know people sometimes roll their eyes when this is brought up — contrast this with how some Russian pranksters contacted his office and said, we have naked pictures of Trump. If I said I had some revenge porn about Trump, I could get in touch with Adam Schiff right away.\"\\n\\nThe reception, in one of the district`s less liberal neighborhoods, was mixed — one woman thanking her for running, one saying she worked with Schiff and had no interest in voting against him. Since flipping a formerly Republican seat in 2000, in a race seen as a referendum on the then-congressman`s vote for Bill Clinton`s impeachment, Schiff had been drawn into a district that backed Hillary Clinton`s 2016 bid by 50 points.\\n\\nSchiff, a frequent target of the president, is not sweating his reelection. None of the people most strongly identified with impeachment are. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi`s only significant challenge is from the left, as is House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler`s. Rep. Maxine Waters of California, one of the Democrats most often attacked for her impeachment advocacy, was set to face a perennial Republican candidate who`d raised more than $400,000 for his bid. He might be brought down by stalking charges, which would put Waters against another long-shot Republican with even more money.\\n\\nWhile the threat of impeachment boosted the president`s fundraising, opposition to it is inefficiently distributed. Republican admakers have targeted the 29 House Democrats who backed at least one article of impeachment while representing districts won by Trump, but the president`s campaign sells anti-Schiff merchandise, not anything aimed at the swing districts. A president who can make even average citizens infamous, with a tweet, has not done much personally to target the Democrats seen as most vulnerable.\\n\\nSome of those Democrats have faced local opposition, but not all; protesters, some organized by the Republican Party, were reportedly rowdy but outnumbered at events for Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia. And recent history hasn`t found that impeachment, long before an election, moves many votes.\\n\\nDemocrats gained five seats in 1998, after Republicans — unlike the 2018 Democrats — spent much of their midterm campaign focused on the need to impeach the president. The party gained just one seat in the 2000 election, as Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush pivoted the party away from direct attacks on Clinton and toward a sense that presidential scandals were limiting Washington’s ambition.\\n\\n“An era of tarnished ideals is giving way to a responsibility era,” Bush said in his 2000 speech at the Republican National Convention. “Our country is ready for high standards and new leaders.”\\n\\nBush’s coattails were short, with Democrats picking up five Senate seats, enough to split control of the chamber. On the House map, Democrats gained one seat in Arkansas, five in California, one in Oklahoma, one in Utah, one in Washington. Republicans gained one seat in Connecticut, one in Michigan, one in Minnesota, one in Missouri, one in Pennsylvania, one in Virginia, one in West Virginia; they won a seat in New York City’s suburbs as Democrats lost a seat there, and they effectively gained one more seat in Virginia when a conservative Democrat became an independent.\\n\\nThe new House majority is larger than the ones Republican were working with during the Clinton impeachment. But there’s been a collapse in “ticket splitting” for federal elections, and the GOP’s 2020 strategy is premised on it. While a few 2018 Republican challengers have put up impressive fundraising numbers, nearly all have been outraised by new Democratic incumbents.\\n\\nFrustratingly for the Republican Party, a number of the biggest fundraisers have been in high-profile seats that won`t be competitive. Challengers to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) have raised close to $1 million combined; challengers to Rep. Antonio Delgado (D-N.Y.), whose Hudson Valley district is more competitive, have raised less than $60,000.\\n\\n2020\\n\\nBernie Sanders. He won the endorsement of People`s Action, a left-wing organizing coalition that vetted Democratic candidates and held a multi-round membership vote to determine who it supported. In the end, around 75 percent of the coalition`s voting members backed Sanders, and some affiliates (such as New Hampshire`s and Vermont`s Rights & Democracy) had already been in his corner.\\n\\nJoe Biden. He unveiled scores of endorsements, mostly from faith leaders in South Carolina (which holds a pivotal primary) and Indiana (where Pete Buttigieg has struggled to gain \"favorite son\"-level support). He also picked up support from New Hampshire House Speaker Steve Shurtleff.\\n\\nElizabeth Warren. She`s on the cover of Rolling Stone this week, with a friendly interview as part of the package.\\n\\nAndrew Yang. He`s rallying in Los Angeles with actor and rapper Donald Glover, a new supporter of his campaign.\\n\\nTom Steyer. He hired Zack Davis, formerly a senior adviser to Kamala Harris in Iowa, to guide his own campaign in the first caucus state.\\n\\nMike Bloomberg. He told NBC News that no other Democrat has the relevant experience he`d bring to the presidency; Joe Biden, he explained, had \"never been the manager of an organization\" and \"never run a school system,\" despite the premise that he could begin fixing the country on day one. \"The presidency shouldn`t be a training job,\" Bloomberg said. \"You need somebody who comes in and knows how to run an organization.\"\\n\\nTulsi Gabbard. She cast the lone \"present\" vote on the two articles of impeachment voted through the House, explaining in a statement that she \"could not in good conscience vote either yes or no.\" In a follow-up video, she said she`d cast a vote \"for much needed reconciliation and hope that together we can heal our country to usher in a bright future for the American people, our country and our nation.\"\\n\\nMichael Bennet. His complaints about debate rules got a supportive op-ed from former New Hampshire Democratic Party chairwoman Kathy Sullivan; he`s spending the two final campaign days before Christmas in central Iowa.\\n\\nDeval Patrick. He released his 11-page \"Deval for All\" governing agenda, putting him roughly in line with the Democrats` House majority on policy: for immigration reform but against breaking up U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), for raising corporate taxes but not to pre-2017 levels.\\n\\nWHAT I`M WATCHING\\n\\nFor months, Democrats braced themselves for bad news. Conservative judge Reed O`Connor had sided with the Trump administration on a flimsy-looking lawsuit, which argued that the Affordable Care Act became unconstitutional when the 2017 tax bill reduced its individual mandate penalty to $0. A conservative-leaning panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit reviewed that case for months, and if it sided with O`Connor, it would tear out the entire 2010 law on the premise that the ACA did not work without a mandate.\\n\\nBut yesterday, that three-judge panel punted. While the conservative majority agreed with the lawsuit`s premise, it ruled that O`Connor, who has gained a reputation for ruling in conservatives` favor, struck down the law without doing \"the necessary legwork of parsing through the over 900 pages of the post-2017 ACA, explaining how particular segments are inextricably linked to the individual mandate.”\\n\\nThat unusual decision put the lawsuit on two tracks, with the law`s defenders working to get it before the Supreme Court quickly and O`Connor, whose initial opinion argued for scrapping the law, to explain what needed to go. Democrats weren`t expecting this, and some were actually optimistic for a clear ruling against them. Why? They expected the current Supreme Court to rule against the conservatives, and on a timeline (June 2020) that would elevate the law`s salience right before the next election.\\n\\nIn the meantime, hours before a debate, campaigns are approaching the legal threats to the ACA differently. Opponents of Medicare-for-all argue for tying the party closer to the ACA, which is popular, and making arguments for expanded insurance access by arguing that Republicans would undo their progress. Supporters of single-payer health care prefer an end-run around the whole legal fight: It was the mandate, first proposed by conservative wonks, that Republicans focused on in two lawsuits to destroy the law. Expanding Medicaid and Medicare to cover everyone could be done with decades of precedent, with no court ready to argue that a government program currently enjoyed by people over 65 can`t be sold to people under that age.\\n\\nCOUNTDOWN\\n\\n... 26 days until the seventh Democratic debate\\n\\n... 46 days until the Iowa caucuses\\n\\n... 54 days until the New Hampshire primary\\n\\n... 65 days until the Nevada caucuses\\n\\n... 73 days until the South Carolina primary The Trailer: Seven things to watch in tonight`s debate 12-2019', doc_id='a2157c67-0191-4b7e-bd80-7972d57904c4', embedding=None, doc_hash='57d1196f8f8b4b966b35ecc1b4372963a7f36fc9284fb5279798fde80676242a', extra_info=None)\n",
      "Document(text='Dr. McFeely worked in banking before turning to academia, inspired in part by the emerging civil rights movement of the 1960s. He went on to help found one of the country’s first African American studies programs, at Yale University, and was considered a leading authority on the Civil War and Reconstruction.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAfter studying at Yale with C. Vann Woodward, considered the dean of historians of the South, Dr. McFeely began a scholarly career that took him from Yale to Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts and the University of Georgia. He gained acclaim for his Pulitzer-winning 1981 biography of Grant, the Union Army Civil War hero who later served two terms as president.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“McFeely’s biography is the first full-scale treatment of all aspects of Grant’s life,” Newsweek book critic Peter Prescott wrote, “the first to attempt a reconciliation of the warrior and the statesman, to explain the psychology that produced such astonishing success and failure. The portrait that emerges — sympathetic yet firm about its subject’s shortcomings — seems to me entirely successful.”\\n\\nGrant had often been depicted in either laudatory or disdainful terms — as a brilliant military tactician or as a drunken boor who was a failure at everything except war. With “revealing pointers and subtle theorizing,” historian Marcus Cunliffe wrote in the New York Times Book Review, Dr. McFeely suggested that Grant’s success as a leader derived from a deep-seated empathy with his soldiers and everyday citizens.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Grant had a gift given to few men; he could reach ordinary people without condescending to them,” Dr. McFeely wrote. “He was, they sensed, one of them. They saw themselves in him. They loved him for both his failures and his successes. They saw in him their own aspirations.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn addition to the Pulitzer Prize, the Grant biography received the Francis Parkman Prize, an annual award from the Society of American Historians for a historical study of exceptional literary merit.\\n\\nDr. McFeely’s next major work examined the life of Douglass, who was born into slavery in Maryland and became a leading writer and orator in support of the abolitionist movement. In his 1991 biography, Dr. McFeely noted that Douglass, one of the most renowned public figures of his time, projected a sense of racial pride that was rare for the time.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It has been said that he ran away from being black,” Dr. McFeely wrote. “The opposite is true. Every time he walked up to a lectern to speak, he was seen: by his very presence he not only announced that he was black but also instructed all who looked at him that they were not to see that fact pejoratively.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe book, which Princeton University historian Nell Irvin Painter called “absolutely nonpareil,” was a finalist for the Pulitzer and won several other awards.\\n\\n“This biography ― tender and critical, respectful yet observant,” Painter wrote in the Boston Globe, “presents a character of Frederick Douglass that is more thoroughly human than seemed possible in careful scholarship, all without diminishing a great man’s stature.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWilliam Shield McFeely was born Sept. 25, 1930, in New York City and grew up in New Jersey. His father was a grocery-chain executive, his mother a homemaker and volunteer.\\n\\nHe said his interest in race relations was spurred by a childhood incident in which a school picnic was almost canceled because one of his classmates was black. The picnic ended up being held at Dr. McFeely’s childhood home.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAfter graduating in 1952 from Amherst College in Massachusetts, Dr. McFeely worked in New York for a forerunner of the Citigroup bank. He often traveled to country banks in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, he told the Boston Globe in 1999, where “I’d find myself walking the streets of the town and getting a sense of it. I have got, I think, the kind of curiosity that makes me able to connect the formal historical past with how people relate to it in the present.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs the civil rights rights movement gained momentum, he left banking after nine years to enter graduate school at Yale, where he received a master’s degree in 1962 and doctorate in American studies in 1966.\\n\\nHis dissertation, which became his first book, was about O.O. Howard, a Union Army general who led the Freedmen’s Bureau after the Civil War, helping enslaved people during Reconstruction. Howard also helped found Howard University, which is named for him, and served as the university’s president.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt Yale in the late 1960s, Dr. McFeely helped launch an African American studies program. One of his students, renowned scholar and professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., told the Yale Daily News that his intellectual career was “ignited by this white guy who taught African-American history.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn 1970, Dr. McFeely moved from Yale to Mount Holyoke College, where he taught for 16 years. He was at the University of Georgia from 1986 until his retirement in 1997.\\n\\nHe began to write books in a more personal style, including “Sapelo’s People” (1994), about the modern-day descendants of slaves living on a Georgia barrier island. He also became an expert witness in trials, particularly in death-penalty cases.\\n\\nHe questioned whether black defendants could get a fair trial in courtrooms displaying the Georgia state flag, which contained a representation of the Confederate battle flag. (Georgia changed the design of its state flag in 2003.)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn 1999, Dr. McFeely published “Proximity to Death,” a book about lawyers who handled death-penalty cases. He retired to Massachusetts and, in 2006, published his final book, a biographical study of painter Thomas Eakins.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHis wife of 66 years, author and librarian Mary Drake McFeely, died in 2018. Survivors include three children, Jennifer McFeely of New York, W. Drake McFeely of Chappaqua, N.Y., and Eliza McFeely of Ewing, N.J.; one sister; seven grandchildren; and a great-grandson.\\n\\nWhile teaching at Yale, Dr. McFeely often toured the South, seeking to recruit promising African American students and professors. In the classroom, he was sometimes challenged by students, Gates later recalled, who questioned his authority to teach black history.\\n\\n“At the end of each lecture,” Gates said in a 2013 forum at the Brookings Institution, “somebody black would stand up and give him a hard time for being white. And they would just be very abusive and very rude . . . how dare he teach this course? And he said he was working hard to hire a black man, but until then, shut up and take your notes and pass your exam.”\\n\\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\\n\\nAD William McFeely, author of Pulitzer-winning biography of U.S. Grant, dies at 89 12-2019', doc_id='9fb99dce-fab2-48fc-bdb3-143ec3a887d5', embedding=None, doc_hash='750417806f9336af39e0adc7ddbae7e72897ae0ae2f58628b90f58eae8cab0ae', extra_info=None)\n",

      "Document(text='CLEVELAND, Ohio - Urban Meyer’s seven-year run at Ohio State is difficult to top with a national championship, two trips to the playoffs and only nine losses. But Buckeye fans might be surprised to learn that had there been a playoff earlier, Ohio State likely would have been invited four times under Jim Tressel and three times under John Cooper.\\n\\nThere, of course, was no four-team playoff until 2014, the season the Buckeyes won the national championship under Meyer.\\n\\nBut to get an idea of how Ohio State -- and every other team in the country -- would have done in making playoff appearances had the format existed earlier, cleveland.com researched rankings over the last 50 seasons. Based on the top four teams in the last rankings before the bowl games each season (or fifth team in the case of a higher-ranked school being on probation), Ohio State would have made the playoffs 16 times over 50 years.\\n\\nThat’s the third most of any school in the country. Alabama would have had 20 playoff appearances and Oklahoma 19.\\n\\nClosest behind Ohio State’s 16 are Florida State with 13, Miami and Nebraska with 12 each, Michigan with 11, USC with eight, and Texas with seven. Forty-one schools would have made the playoffs over the last half-century, including regular-season unbeaten Cincinnati in 2009.\\n\\nShown in the chart at the bottom of this story are the would-be playoff teams by year, for 1970 to 2019.\\n\\nThese projections were calculated by using the the last AP poll before the bowl games for each season from 1970 through 2013, then the playoff selection committee rankings in 2014-19.\\n\\nThe playoff committee has actually matched the AP top four in five of the six playoff years -- though sometimes in different ranking order for those four. The lone exception to the playoff choices was 2014, when Ohio State entered bowl play ranked No. 5 by the AP, behind Baylor, but the playoff committee picked Ohio State.\\n\\nIf a team was banned from postseason, it was eliminated from the playoff grouping for this analysis. This occurred four times - eliminating Oklahoma in 1973 and 1974, Florida in 1984 and Ohio State in 2012. (Ohio State in 2012 was undefeated in Meyer’s first season, but the school was banned from postseason play because of violations under Tressel.)\\n\\nAs for the Buckeyes, playoff appearances would have broken down this way, by coach:\\n\\n* Woody Hayes (5) - 1970, 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1975. Note that Hayes’ total would be higher if our research extended before 1970.\\n\\n* Earle Bruce (1) - 1979.\\n\\n* John Cooper (3) - 1995, 1996 and 1998.\\n\\n* Jim Tressel (4) - 2002, 2005, 2006 and 2007.\\n\\n* Urban Meyer (2) - 2014 and 2016.\\n\\n* Ryan Day (1) - 2019.\\n\\nPoll/playoff history\\n\\nHere are the playoff teams since 2014, with the playoff committee’s rankings, and the would-be playoff teams each year from 1970 through 2013 based on AP rankings. The rankings for 2014-19 are the actual playoff seedings; the earlier rankings shown are from the last AP poll before bowl games.

      "Document(text='When Annie Dillard wrote Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, she didn’t think anyone would want to read a memoir by a \"Virginia housewife.\" So she left her domestic life out of the book—and turned her surroundings into a wilderness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLink Copied\\n\\n\\n\\nIn her memoir, Wild, Cheryl Strayed describes what it was like to be a woman hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, where a fellow traveler dubbed her “the only girl in the woods.” Strayed wasn’t just a rarity on the rugged PCT. She’s one of relatively few female writers in an American tradition that dates back to Henry David Thoreau. “The mythic frontier individualist was almost always masculine in gender,” notes environmental history professor William Cronon in a 1995 New York Times Magazine article. “Here, in the wilderness, a man could be a real man, the rugged individual he was meant to be before civilization sapped his energy and threatened his masculinity.” One of the first women to defy this stereotype and write her way into the male-dominated canon was Annie Dillard. She won the 1975 nonfiction Pulitzer Prize for Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, a book describing her explorations in the Virginia valley where she lived. In its chapters, she spends a lot of time sitting on a sycamore log over the creek, watching a praying mantis lay eggs or seeing a giant water bug sucking up a frog’s body (leaving behind its crumpled skin). She comes across as audacious, inquisitive, and hilarious, chasing wood ducks and sleeping alone without a tent under a moonless sky. The book raises questions about the horrors and beauties of nature, and the power of the present moment in a world that’s constantly being created. It’s also a chronicle of solitude.\\n\\nIn many ways, Pilgrim reads like an updated version of Walden, and that’s exactly the kind of book Dillard was trying to write. At one point, while thinking through the order of her chapters, she jotted down in her notes, “Remember HDT’s [Henry David Thoreau’s] alternation of chapters with solitude + society, light and dark, indoors and outdoors, etc. How to do this?” As Dillard considered potential titles for the book, she thought of Tinker Creek (echoing Thoreau’s Walden), Creekside Solitaire (adapting Edward Abbey’s Desert Solitaire), Infinite Storm (borrowing a line from John Muir), and Tinker Creek Almanac (evoking Aldo Leopold’s Sand County Almanac). But no matter what she named her book, Dillard knew she wasn’t like those other authors. She wasn’t a man living alone in the wild. In fact, she wasn’t even living alone. She was residing in an ordinary house with her husband—her former college poetry professor, Richard Dillard. Before she published her book, she scribbled in her journal, wondering who would take her book seriously if its author was a “Virginia housewife named Annie.” She couldn`t change the fact that she lived in Virginia or was a housewife named Annie, but in the end, it didn’t matter. Her husband never made it into the book.\\n\\nI first discovered Dillard’s effort to enter the canon of wilderness writing while leafing through her notebooks—making my way through 74 boxes and 49.35 linear feet of scrapbooks, journals, notecards, high school diaries, and letters to editors and friends, most of which Dillard had donated herself to Yale’s Beinecke Library. I was there as a researcher but also as a fan. I had read Thoreau for years; my most-used copy of Walden (for some reason, I’ve accumulated four) no longer has a front or back cover. I absorbed the book’s emphasis on solitude and looked for ways to experience it in my own life: I took time off from college. I camped alone. I went for 40-mile trail runs alone. I lived in an Alaskan cabin without water or electricity alone.\\n\\nEventually, I discovered Dillard, and it wasn’t long before my copy of Pilgrim was nearly as tattered and broken as my Walden. When I found out about her Yale archive, I dove in without looking for anything in particular—maybe a few more lyrical passages and some answers to nosy questions, like what her parents had thought when she’d married her professor as a 20-year-old, why she’d divorced that husband, and how she’d met her new one. What I found, though, was evidence of her deliberate effort to join the ranks of American authors who had ventured alone into the wild. “It’s impossible to imagine another situation where you can’t write a book ’cause you weren’t born with a penis,” wrote Dillard in her journal. “Except maybe Life With My Penis.” Dillard had been thinking deeply and critically about wilderness writing ever since her days at Hollins, a small women’s college in Virginia. After she graduated with a bachelor’s degree in English in 1967, she stayed for another year and wrote a master’s thesis about Walden. In her thesis, she made playful jabs at Thoreau. Wondering what kind of book it was, she observed that it wasn’t a classic naturalist’s notebook (“Walden Pond is remarkably devoid of interesting wildlife”). It wasn’t social satire (the satire in it was “never sustained or directed”). It wasn’t a one-man utopian treatise (“Thoreau’s venture in the woods was not a commitment to a way of life but an extended vacation”). It wasn’t philosophy, either (“the philosophy in Walden is imprecise, disordered, and mostly if not entirely derivative”). She argued that Walden was “really a book about a pond.”\\n\\nFrom there, though, her initial jibes turned toward admiration. She called the pond “a vehicle for thought,” “the perfect metaphor,” “not like heaven; it is heaven.” (Thoreau had made this explicit: “Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads.”) According to Dillard, dwelling on the pond itself afforded Thoreau “not a fleeting painful glimpse of what might be, but a constant and inspiring parable of what is.” At the time she wrote this thesis, Dillard was living near Hollins with her husband, Richard, whom she had married at the end of her sophomore year. After she finished her degree, her life remained very much the same. She had lunches with her friends on the faculty, read, and drew. She wrote poems she sent to magazines and eventually published in the collection Tickets for a Prayer Wheel. But her main project was softball. She hung around the graduate students at Hollins, most of whom were men, to make sure she would have enough people to play with in the spring. “Back then it was rare for a woman my age, my time, to have a boy’s arm,” she told me during a recent phone conversation. “And I had exactly that thing, so I wanted to play with people who could play. I loved the game.”\\n\\nOne day, an alumna came back to Hollins to visit Richard, and since he was busy, Dillard took her for a stroll around the neighborhood. “On the walk I thought, God there’s a lot of neat stuff out here, and after that, I started taking those walks all the time,” she told me. “I was fascinated because it was just a stupid little suburban neighborhood, but animals don’t care. They don’t care a bit. And I would always see interesting animals around.”\\n\\nIn October of 1972, she and her husband went on a trip up north. “Richard Dillard was on sabbatical, and I was all excited about camping,” she told me. “And so I dragged him off to camping in Maine, at Acadia car camping, nothing interesting. And we lived there that whole October, in that tent. And I was reading and reading and reading as I always do.” According to her journals at the time, Dillard had read 58 books since her graduation a few years earlier. Some of them were “giant-sized,” as she put it. Others, by authors like Merton, Thoreau, and Emerson, she called “heavy going.” One of the books she read that fall was The Northern Farm, a 1949 memoir by Henry Beston that chronicles an agricultural season in Maine. It didn’t prove to be a satisfying read, but it did change her life. In one of her journals—filled with a mix of musings, observations, notes, and doodles—Dillard began an entry with the title, “Why I didn’t like this book.” She wrote, “It was a bore. Not only did nothing happen, okay, but there was no trace of mind. As a naturalist he didn’t teach me a thing. He didn’t even bother to look up fireflies. As an observer of the social scene, which is a boring thing to be in the 1st place, he’s ordinary and conservative. No imagination.” As Dillard kept writing, though, she realized something: what Beston lacked—knowledge of the two enzymes that allow fireflies to make their light, imagination, and a “trace of mind”—she could provide. And in that moment of I could do better, the idea for Pilgrim was born.\\n\\nBut how would she do it? She scribbled notes about two books she did like—Abbey’s Desert Solitaire and Beston’s The Outermost House—and asked what had made those year-in-the-woods books successful. Her answer? A sense of the author’s courage. She wondered how to structure her book in some other way than by the seasons. She wondered if she should say that she lived in West Virginia rather than in Virginia to “get the freaks.” “Damn it,” she wrote. “I’m going to do it, I am.” By the time Dillard decided to write Pilgrim, she had filled dozens of journals with passages from what she had been reading, anecdotes from her walks, facts about natural history, and dreams about luna moths mating. She had started writing in journals to help her quit smoking, but by the time she was writing in her second spiral notebook, she’d realized writing down her thoughts gave her physical access to the contents of her mind, as if everything she had ever read were fresh in her mind. “Of course I’m smoking still,” she told me recently. “That was one of many times I quit smoking.” In the pages of those 1970s journals, she sometimes wondered if Thoreau got lonely (“He wouldn’t have been utterly sexless, could he?”). She wrestled with questions of religion (“Even if you won’t grant a God, there’s still nature, still what is”). She looked at tiny things and had huge thoughts: In one entry, she described a stroll in which she encountered an old prescription bottle, collected some kind of egg case in it, and showed it to a scientist. She told him what she thought the big idea of nature was. “And he said, ‘Gee, I never thought of that,’ and I wondered what he had been thinking about.”\\n\\nShe decided to use her journals to write the book and set about copying what she thought was most interesting onto notecards. She ended up with a 17-inch box filled with 1,100 notecards that she shuffled and reshuffled, trying to divide the anecdotes, facts, quotes, and ideas into chapters. The glee of coming up with the idea for the book soon gave way to the struggle of putting the book together. She asked in one notebook, “What the hell am I going to do with these notecards?” Pages later, she wrote, “I am going nuts over this book. What kind of book is it?”\\n\\nShe saw her material as two books, one like Northern Farm (“walks and descriptions—a narrative of homelife a pied”) and another that was “wildly artistic, poetic in a strong sense, and even theological.” At the time, this seemed to her like a battle in which one side would win out over the other. But the combination of these two elements eventually defined Pilgrim. After all, other year-in-the-woods books had done the same, often mixing the life of the legs in the country with the life of the mind there. The bigger problem was figuring out what to do with the parts of her life that didn’t fit the mold. The woods that Tinker Creek wind through are a couple of miles from Hollins College. The campus is nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains but within the limits of Roanoke, a city with a population just under 100,000 at the time Dillard was writing.\\n\\nDillard knew that being a graduate student, or a professor’s wife living in the suburbs, wasn’t as exciting as, say, living alone in Arches National Park, as Abbey did. In Desert Solitaire, he describes the gopher snake he befriended to keep rattlesnakes away from his trailer. The gopher sometimes wrapped around his waist, inside his shirt, and rested on his belt. (“I’m a humanist,” he writes, “I’d rather kill a man than a snake.”) Such a narrator embodied all the right American ideals: the mythic frontiersman, the wild man, the true hermit. Dillard became worried and discouraged. She wrote in her journal, “It’s impossible to imagine another situation where you can’t write a book ’cause you weren’t born with a penis. Except maybe Life With My Penis.” One thing Dillard knew—but many of her potential readers didn’t—was that there had always been a certain amount of delusion involved in the lone-man-in-the-wilderness narrative. It started with Thoreau: Around the time Walden came out in 1854, Americans were beginning to see nature as a place to find peace—not a force to be subdued, as their Puritans ancestors had believed. “In Wildness is the preservation of the World,” Thoreau wrote in his 1862 Atlantic essay “Walking.” “Every tree sends its fibers forth in search of the Wild. The cities import it at any price. Men plow and sail for it. From the forest and wilderness come the tonics and barks which brace mankind.”\\n\\nBut what was the “wildness” Thoreau was describing? Critics have pointed out that Thoreau’s cabin, on land owned by his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson, was within easy walking distance of Concord. There were rumors that he’d had his mother do his laundry the whole time he was living in at Walden. Emerson himself has been criticized for being an armchair naturalist who philosophized about the woods without ever truly immersing himself in them. Still, the ideal of the authentic wilderness man carried on long after Thoreau. John Muir, who read Walden as a young man, gently mocked the Transcendentalists for their civilized New England version of “wildness.” Muir actually did live in the wild, setting off for weeks at a time on what others called his “wild goose chases.” He walked with no blankets through Canada, climbed high into the trees to feel the whip of storms, and plunged into the icy waters of a crevasse amid the glaciers of Southeast Alaska. In one essay, published in The Atlantic in 1900, Muir recalled how he’d invited Emerson to Yosemite and tried to persuade him to spend the night in the camp. “You are yourself a sequoia,” Muir had futilely pleaded. “Stop and get acquainted with your big brethren.” By that time, the Sage of Concord had already failed in his efforts to civilize Muir. “Emerson prophesies … that I will one day go to him and ‘better men’ in New England, or something to that effect,” wrote Muir in an 1873 letter, “but I have been too long wild, too befogged and befogged to burn well in their patent high-heated educational furnaces.”\\n\\nAfter Muir, other writers strove to emulate his brand of wilderness living, but few were able to live up to it. In 1913, Joseph Knowles went off to wander alone in the Maine woods with no equipment, attempting to live “as Adam lived.” But his one-time experiment was just 60 days long and carefully designed to impress readers of The Boston Post. As Roderick Nash recounts in his book Wilderness and the American Mind, Knowles wrote dispatches for the newspaper with charcoal on birch bark about his adventures making friction fires, bark clothing, and meals of berries and trout. When he returned to Boston, he was welcomed with cheers, and he toured from Augusta to Portland, giving speeches to thousands of people about the merits of living in the wild. His book Alone in the Wilderness sold 300,000 copies. “Emerson prophesies … that I will one day go to him and ‘better men’ in New England, or something to that effect,” wrote John Muir in an 1873 letter, “but I have been too long wild.” Americans still like what Dillard calls the “purity” associated with living alone in the wild. In a recent article for GQ, Michael Finkel wrote about “the last true hermit,” a man named Christopher Knight who had spent nearly 30 years living alone in the woods of central Maine. When the man was arrested for the 40 or so robberies he had committed, he was surprised that so many people he encountered expected him to speak in aphorisms and have some hidden insight into the true nature of society—as though everyone who had chosen to live in the woods was granted Thoreau-like wisdom. \"Some people want me to be this warm and fuzzy person,” said Knight. “All filled with friendly hermit wisdom. Just spouting off fortune-cookie lines from my hermit home.\"\\n\\nThe demand for a true wilderness experience has spilled over to TV, where shows like Man vs. Wild and even the Survivor franchise try to create an illusion of total isolation. Alaska: The Last Frontier, a reality show on the Discovery Channel, documents the life of an extended family homesteading in the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska. Each episode opens with a pan of the surrounding land. In this pan, producers carefully avoid the nearby town of Homer, where the camera crew stays, making the Kilchers look like they live alone in the snowy mountains at the edge of the world. Dillard knew what American audiences wanted when she began working on her book. In one journal entry, she considered writing it as a novel, in the voice of a male narrator living alone at “the Lucas place,” which is a house that makes an appearance in Pilgrim: a one-room cottage that she describes as mostly porch and broken windows. Without the constraints of nonfiction, Dillard wrote, she would have the right sex (male), the right number of people (one), and the right home (remote cabin). “If I call it truth and leave out Richard and this house, then not only do I lose the selling-points I think I need—but also I open myself to the charge of hating my husband,” she mused in her journal. “But I think I must. I switch around.” In one of her notebooks, she described a conversation she had with her husband and two friends one evening that fall. None of them seemed to understand her dilemma. They didn’t agree that “being a man, and being alone, are essential. And that the reader buys a man alone in nature more than the details of natural history.\"\\n\\nRichard later read one of her early attempts to write in a male voice, and he told her she sounded like “a fruit.” One of the give-aways was her mention of Kleenex: All men, he explained, carried handkerchiefs. Dillard eventually settled on writing the book as nonfiction—or something close. “After all,” she wrote in one journal, “we’ve had the nonfiction novel—it’s time for the novelized book of nonfiction.” The book begins with an act of novelization. In her notes, she wrote that she wanted to start with an image that would be something about “(baptism), blood as X’s [Christ’s] sacrifice, wash as baptism, death and mystery and beauty liberates.” She accomplished that with this evocative sentence: “I used to have a cat, an old fighting tom, who would jump through the open window by my bed in the middle of the night and land on my chest.” Some mornings, she went on to say, she’d wake up to find herself covered with bloody paw prints that looked like roses. When Dillard was brainstorming this opening scene in the fall of 1972, she wrote, “Open whole w/ waking up covered with bloody paw marks… (prob: why is window open unscreened?).” This last “problem” refers to how the cat would have been able to jump through her window, land on her chest, stick his skull under her nose, and purr. (She ultimately solved that problem by setting the scene in the heat of summer and later adding that she now sleeps with the window shut.) When I asked about the tomcat in the first sentence, she told me she’d heard a similar story from “some poor graduate student” named Frank McCullough over lunch at the Hollins snack bar. “I said, ‘Gosh that’s a good image,’” Dillard told me. “I was just the faculty wife. ‘Oh, can I use that?’ ‘Sure honey.’ We had no idea in the world that these words were going to live. It was a great first sentence.”\\n\\nSome of the novelization was subtler. With a name like “Annie Dillard” on the cover, there was no hiding her gender. “All of the books I took as models had been written by men,” she told me. “And my father, most importantly, never read a book by a woman in his whole life.” She continued to think about publishing the book under a pseudonym. “I thought it would have a better chance. You know — if you write something you want someone to see it.” But after she published a chapter in Harper’s and another in The Atlantic under her real name, “the jig was up.” Even though Pilgrim was clearly written by a woman, its narrator doesn’t always seem like one. In one passage, Dillard compares herself to a man who returns to the battlefield where he lost a leg or an arm. In another, she describes herself as “King of the Meadow.” In a third, she asks herself, “What if I were the first man in the world?” Disguising her surroundings was more of a challenge. Her friends were amused when they read through her early notes and drafts and saw descriptions of a valley far from human settlement. As she wrote in her journal, they “said, laughing, that they got the sense I was living in this incredible wilderness.” Dillard also went out of her way to emphasize her aloneness. In the first chapter, she compares her home to “an anchorite’s hermitage,” alluding to a simple shed clamped onto the side of a church like a barnacle. Later, she describes herself as “no longer quite fit for company.” The only human interaction she has in the book is with a man who gives her a Styrofoam cup of coffee on a solitary drive home. The husband she lives with, the friends she lunches with, and the people she plays softball with are all conspicuously missing.\\n\\nIn one dramatic moment, late in the book, Dillard shrinks from the brutality of nature. “It looks for the moment as though I might have to reject the creek life unless I want to be utterly brutalized,” she writes. “Is human culture with its values my only real home after all? Can it possibly be that I should move my anchor-hold to the side of a library?” In fact, by the time she wrote the last half of the book, she was spending her days in a study carrel in the Hollins College library. As Dillard later recounted in her 1989 memoir The Writing Life, the window she sat next to while writing much of Pilgrim overlooked a tar-and-gravel roof, and as she worked, she could see people pulling into the parking lot and climbing out of their cars. She found this sight distracting, so she lowered the blinds and covered them with a hand-drawn picture of a landscape. Dillard was so successful in casting herself as a lone sojourner that online biographies often allude to an undefined period when she left her husband and went off to live alone in the woods. When I was in college, I heard a student, whom I’ll call Kate, fall into this error; she introduced Dillard before a class discussion of her work and apologized that she hadn’t been able to pinpoint the exact dates of Dillard’s time in the wild. The reason she couldn’t find those dates was that Dillard had never left civilization. She’d simply left civilization out of the book.\\n\\nIf the author conveys a resonant truth, does it matter what experiences led to the realizations?\\n\\nWhen I first emailed Dillard and asked her about the differences between her own life and that of Pilgrim’s narrator, she responded by invoking Thoreau. As she pointed out, the 1957 study The Making of Walden showed that Thoreau had condensed more than two years of his life into a one-year narrative. She went on: “Thoreau scholars ridicule youths who say Thoreau’s no good because he (sometimes) (often) (every night) had dinner at his mother`s house in Concord. As youth I, too, sought purity. Now I know we`re all compromised by impurities, by the conditions of time and death.” Later, Dillard emphasized that a nonfiction writer has an unwritten pact with the reader: that the writer is telling the truth. “Walden, shaped as it was,” she added, “nevertheless told the truth.” When Pilgrim was published, Dillard didn’t try to hide the fact that the book was, at times, a work of imagination. Even at the height of her fame, in 1978, Dillard told interviewer Mike Major how she’d written Pilgrim from hundreds of notecards, calling it hard and terribly frustrating work and acknowledging that she sometimes distorted the literal truth to achieve an artistic one. But readers, she said, “think it happens in a dream, that you just sit on a tree stump and take dictation from some little chipmunk.” She resisted the idea that the public was making her into a cult figure, retorting, “All that stuff about lifestyle is completely irrelevant!” “I didn’t say, ‘I walked by the suburban brick houses.’ Why would I say that to the reader? But when I saw that reviewers were acting like it was the wilderness, I said, ‘Oh, shit.’” I asked Dillard whether any other details in the book besides the tomcat had been invented rather than seen. “Gee, I can’t think of any,” she said. “It wasn’t exactly totally exciting. A little muskrat in a creek or ditch. My current husband used to see them in ditches in Denver all the time. If I were going to make up stuff, it would be bears! Mountain lions! Eagles! No, I wasn’t making up stuff.”\\n\\nHer greatest distortions, she added, had been omissions rather than inventions. “I didn’t obscure anything, I just left it out,” she said, referring to her husband and her suburban life. She told me in an email that she had asked Richard how he wanted to be treated in the book. “He said, ‘Leave me out of it.’ (Not yelling—he never yelled. A wonderful man.) Sure; of course I complied. He had been my professor!” She added that he hadn’t been involved in the excursions she described. “It’s not that Richard Dillard was taking walks with me and I wrote him out—that didn’t happen at all. He was teaching!” she said. “Have you ever been married? You don’t go around as a unit.” Even still, she said, before publishing Pilgrim she hadn’t realized how wild she’d made the valley seem. “I didn’t say, ‘I walked by the suburban brick houses,’” she told me. “Why would I say that to the reader? But when I saw that reviewers were acting like it was the wilderness, I said, ‘Oh, shit.’ So the first thing I wrote after was ‘The Weasels,’” referring to “Living Like Weasels,” an essay that appears in her 1982 book Teaching a Stone to Talk. “I said in it, ‘This is, mind you, suburbia.’ Because I hadn’t meant to deceive anybody. I just put in what was interesting.” That essay also included a tamer description of the valley. In a paragraph about Hollins Pond, which is near Tinker Creek, Dillard writes, “It is a five-minute walk in three directions to rows of houses, though none is visible here. There`s a 55-mph highway at one end of the pond, and a nesting pair of wood ducks at the other. Under every bush is a muskrat hole or a beer can. The far end is an alternating series of fields and woods, fields and woods, threaded everywhere with motorcycle tracks—in whose bare clay wild turtles lay eggs.”\\n\\nAs for why she relocated to the library, she pointed out that writers typically do write at desks or tables; only the most naive reader would have assumed that she’d written all of Pilgrim while sitting outside with a notebook on her knees. It also helped to get some distance from home, she added—and not just because “the house keeps crying out to you, ‘Fix me! Wash me!’” She continued, “Writers very often need to be away from a place to write about it well. Ibsen wrote his Norway plays when he was living in Italy. Willa Cather wrote her prairie novels when she was living in New York City. James Joyce wrote his Dublin novel and Dublin short stories when he was living in Paris. Mark Twain wrote about Missouri when he was living in Hartford. Walt Whitman wrote about life outside and they found out recently he barely left his room. That’s called critical distance or something. You have to have it.” After all, as Dillard told me, one of the goals of writing about an experience is to mythologize it—“not that one is aware that one is mythologizing, but you want everything simplified and enlarged.” Most of us do this subconsciously whenever we tell stories. (That Alaskan cabin without water or electricity I mentioned earlier? I did live there alone, but it didn’t occur to me to add that I actually lived pretty close to the homesteaders I rented the cabin from and often visited them to charge my phone and use their Internet.) The best wilderness stories are valued not just for their descriptions of solitude and wilderness, but also for the insights their authors gain during their encounters with the natural world—what Dillard called their “trace of mind.” The Thoreau of the Suburbs 12-2019', doc_id='93b8b191-e805-4139-b18a-fbe192821f86', embedding=None, doc_hash='0487e641fbce23aaf35d35d69c8501a3b53fe7fccee6a15f49bdb67a0ffab52e', extra_info=None)\n",
      "Document(text='USA TODAY\\n\\nThe NCAA has pretty strict moral standards for advertisers and sponsors at college football bowl games, according to the organization’s postseason bowl handbook.\\n\\nThe 24-page document states that “pool halls” with adult entertainment are not permitted to be associated with these games. Casinos, beer, wine, and other alcoholic products also are listed as “impermissible,” among other potential sponsors. The goal is to make sure the commercial and sponsorship activities of bowl games are “consistent with the values associated with collegiate sports,” as stated in the handbook’s second paragraph.\\n\\nSo then why do at least 20 of the 40 postseason games list beer companies, liquor brands or casino companies as sponsors or partners on their websites? Why does the TaxSlayer Gator Bowl in Jacksonville list at least seven hard liquor brands as “Chairman’s Club” partners?\\n\\nAnd why is it permissible for the Las Vegas Bowl to be sponsored by Bud Light and several casino companies?\\n\\n“Fair question,” NCAA spokesman Chris Radford said in an e-mail.\\n\\nWith bowl season set to begin Friday, critics say the answer involves money, appearances and a sliding scale of morality — all part of larger controversies in which the NCAA struggles to balance its wholesome educational mission with its member schools` thirst for sports revenue.\\n\\nThe NCAA does not operate bowl games, but it does certify their right to host NCAA teams and ensures they meet minimum standards of governance. The NCAA president and his staff even have the authority to rule about “whether sponsors/advertisers associated with Division I bowl games meet the principles stated” in the handbook, according to the handbook.\\n\\nBut what the NCAA says about its standards can be quite different from what it actually does, said David Berri, a sports economist at Southern Utah University who has studied NCAA issues.\\n\\nWATCHABILITY RANKINGS:Prioritizing the 39 college football bowl matchups\\n\\nWith bowl games, the NCAA confirmed that, “in practice,” it generally only enforces these standards on sponsorship displays that could be seen by one of two audiences — viewers on television or NCAA athletes at bowl-related events. So then why doesn’t this match what the NCAA published in its own handbook, especially when NCAA staff and various committees that include school representatives often rigidly enforce precise rules for the eligibility of athletes?\\n\\nThe NCAA official who helps oversee the bowlpolicies, Ty Halpin, declined comment, Radford said.\\n\\nThe NCAA’s Division I Football Oversight Committee has input on the handbook and is led by chairman Shane Lyons, the athletic director at West Virginia.\\n\\n“The language (in the handbook), now that you’re throwing it out there, probably could be cleaned up a lot more,” Lyons told USA TODAY Sports.\\n\\nLyons said changing entertainment options have led to changing attitudes about casino and alcohol sponsorships, along with alcohol sales at college events. As game attendance has declined in recent years, schools have become concerned about drawing fans to games when they could just stay home and watch them on large televisions without waiting in line to buy beer.\\n\\nThis year the Southeastern Conference voted to lift a ban on stadium alcohol sales, allowing those schools to join others that already allowed it despite concerns about alcohol abuse. Last year, the NCAA`s Division I even voted to allow alcohol sales at NCAA championship events such as the Final Four.\\n\\nAt bowl games, the same NCAA handbook allows alcoholic drink sales, just not alcohol sponsorships. Premium draft beer at the Rose Bowl in January sold for $16 each.\\n\\n“A lot has changed,” Lyons said. “I’m not even sure when this (handbook) was written and last updated.”\\n\\n`Hoping people aren`t going to notice`\\n\\nLyons said such changes are reflected in how the NCAA regulates casino and alcohol sponsorships for bowl games in practice, if not according to its written virtues. In practice, the NCAA allows them up to a point so that they’re “secondary” sponsorships.\\n\\nFor example, “impermissible” sponsors aren’t allowed in the titles of the games. The NCAA therefore would not permit a game to be called the Avion Tequila Bowl, even though Avion Tequila is listed as a “Chairman’s Club” partner on the Gator Bowl website, along with Elijah Craig Bourbon, Tito’s Handmade Vodka, Wiser’s Whisky, Beefeater London gin, Admiral Nelson’s rum, Daily’s Cocktails, Budweiser and at least eight wine companies.\\n\\nGator Bowl CEO Rick Catlett said these partners are submitted to the NCAA annually.\\n\\n\"They (NCAA staff) see it every year,\" he said. \"I know it’s never been flagged because they never even bat an eye in certifying us.\"\\n\\nCOACHES SALARIES: USA TODAY database of how much coaches make\\n\\nSponsors that are considered “impermissible” also are not allowed to be “in-camera view” — meaning not on prominent signs in stadiums where they can be seen on television during games. Therefore, viewers shouldn’t be able to see a big stadium sign for the Greektown Casino-Hotel at the Quick Lane Bowl in Detroit on Dec. 26, but they can find it listed as a sponsor on that bowl game’s website.\\n\\n“We just make sure that if there is a sponsor in question, that the student-athletes aren’t going to see it, and nor will you see it on television,” said Mark Neville, CEO of the San Diego County Credit Union Holiday Bowl in San Diego.\\n\\nHe said this is how his organization is allowed to have Coronado Brewing Company as a partner, which provides products for hospitality suites and helps with other community support of the game.\\n\\nSuch sponsorship displays are not viewable on TV but could include exposure benefits on less-visible platforms, such as fundraisers, the printed game program or the bowl’s website. Though these smaller sponsorships generally aren’t as lucrative, they still face the public and can help bring in money for the bowls through cash or trade.\\n\\nAnd that’s part of the equation, said George Belch, a marketing professor at San Diego State. Bowl games need revenue to be able to pay conferences and schools to play in them, as well as other operationalcosts, including paychecks for bowl executives who often earn well over $300,000 annually. Meanwhile, the schools want bowl games to be financially sound, helping ensure that every eligible team with a minimum record of 6-6 has a bowl destination.\\n\\nBerri, the sports economist, said the parsing over which alcohol and casino sponsors are viewable by whom misses the larger point.\\n\\n“If your handbook says this and you’re still doing it and your excuse is, `Well, we’re not doing it as big as we could be,` I’m sorry, what the hell is that?” Berri said. “Clearly you’re doing this because you’re hoping people aren’t going to notice and people make money off of this.”\\n\\nBy putting out a handbook that rejects certain businesses as sponsors on moral grounds, Berri said the NCAA can exert regulatory power over bowl games and attempt to reflect a virtuous “collegiate model.” Simultaneously, by still allowing these “impermissible” businesses to be sponsors out of view of television cameras, he said the NCAA can help bowl game operators continue to generate revenue up to a point that wouldn’t appear to be too noticeably hypocritical.\\n\\n“I think they’re going to try to look the other way as much as they can,” Belch said.\\n\\n`What does the camera see?`\\n\\nAbout 10 years ago, the NCAA even killed a proposal to let 5-Hour Energy become title sponsor of the International Bowl in Toronto, leading that bowl to go out of business, said Don Loding, the game’s former executive director. It didn’t matter that 5-Hour Energy is non-alcoholic.\\n\\nWhat mattered is the appearance of conflict for a potentially high-profile sponsor. Such drinks contain a stimulant — caffeine — on the NCAA’s banned list, which technically could cause an athlete to flunk a drug test if consumed in large amounts two to three hours before competition.\\n\\nBOWL PICKS:USA TODAY Sports college football staff picks for every bowl game\\n\\nFor similar reasons, another energy drink brand also was denied as a title sponsor for a bowl game this season, said Wright Waters, executive director for the Football Bowl Association, an industry trade group.\\n\\nWaters said that bowl game operators understand that NCAA sponsorship rules generally only apply to the question of “What does the camera see?” in the game itself, he said.\\n\\nHe cautioned against reading NCAA regulations “like a New York lawyer” would.\\n\\n“You’re looking at it from 30,000 feet, and sometimes the NCAA rulebook is written from 10 feet,” he said.\\n\\nThe NCAA bowl handbook states that its principles are “applicable” to title sponsors, presenting sponsors and in-venue sponsors that might be seen on TV. For those sponsorships, the NCAA requires bowls to submit them to the NCAA for approval. The handbook also says its policies are designed to encourage those major sponsors that support the NCAA’s ideals, and to “exclude those advertisements and advertisers (and others who wish to associate with Division I football bowl activities) that do not appear to be in the best interests of higher education and student-athletes.”\\n\\nTo flex the NCAA`s power over bowls, the handbook even says it has the authority to \"review any document specifically related to the bowl game,\" including \"title sponsor and other corporate contracts.\"\\n\\nThese guidelines are similar to advertising guidelines for NCAA-operated championship events such as the Division I basketball tournaments. The NCAA has allowed limited advertising at those events for malt beverage, beer and wine products that “do not exceed 6% alcohol by volume.” Some NCAA members recently have pushed to modify such limitations for NCAA championships, which could open the door for more revenue.\\n\\nIn late October, the NCAA Board of Governors — the association`s top policy-making body —also considered changing advertising restrictions for NCAA championships to “permit sponsorships by liquor, beer or wine companies,” according to the board’s meeting minutes.\\n\\nBut the board rejected that notion, holding NCAA championship events to a higher standard than member schools, which have been allowed to have beer sponsorships. In 2017, for example, the University of Texas announced that Corona Extra would be an official sponsor of the Longhorns. The College Football Playoff also has an official beer sponsor, Dos Equis, even though the playoff includes bowl games subject to handbook rules.\\n\\n“The rules that govern individual schools are different than the rules that NCAA championships are governed by, and the bowls get caught somewhere in between,” Waters said. He said this has been a concern for bowl games, because they are certified by the NCAA but not operated by them.\\n\\nESPN, which owns the Las Vegas Bowl and several other bowl games, said in a statement, “All of our current bowl sponsors have been reviewed and approved by the NCAA.\" It declined further comment.\\n\\nCatlett of the Gator Bowl said the \"partners\" on his website, including the liquor brands, would be required to pay at least $9,500 in cash or trade to the game`s nonprofit parent organization. They then get benefits in return, such as tickets to the game.\\n\\n`How did they get our logo?`\\n\\nMany liquor brands also didn’t return messages inquiring about their relationships with bowl games. But two listed sponsors that did respond distanced themselves from the bowl games, seemingly underscoring the sensitivity involved because of the language in the handbook.\\n\\nIn Detroit, the vice president of marketing at the Greektown Casino-Hotel, Ryan Bufalini, said he didn’t know the Quick Lane Bowl had identified the casino-hotel as a sponsor on the bowl’s online sponsor page. The casino-hotel’s logo is listed right under that oftire and auto company Quick Lane, the game’s title sponsor. Bufalini said bowl spectators often stay at his hotel-casino near the game but that it is not a “financial sponsor.”\\n\\n“How did they get our logo?” he said. “They must have just lifted it off of something. Yeah, we’re not sponsoring it in any way.”\\n\\nA message seeking comment from the Quick Lane Bowl wasn’t returned.\\n\\nOn the Gator Bowl website, one of the Chairman’s Club partners is Daily’s Cocktails, a Harvest Hill Beverage company. That company’s marketing director, Greg Riley, said, “We are actually not a sponsor of the Gator Bowl Game.” Instead, he said a distribution partner, Southern Glazer’s Wine and Spirits, collects product donations for the game`s parent organization. Those donations support fundraising receptions throughout the year, he said.\\n\\n“Our sales team annually donates four cases of Daily’s Non-Alcoholic Mixers (Bloody Mary & Margarita) to the association,” Riley said in an e-mail. “The proceeds raised from these charity events help `Send A Child To The Game’ and numerous other programs.”\\n\\nIn return, the Gator Bowl is listing Daily’s Cocktails as a partner on its website, which includes the company’s logo with a martini glass in place of the letter Y. When viewers click on it, they are sent to a website that asks them to verify their age is at least 21 before entering.\\n\\nViewers then can see a variety of the company’s alcoholic drinks and mixers, as well as where to buy them.\\n\\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

      "Document(text='Arizona Republic\\n\\nPHOENIX — Arizona education leaders allowed a Scottsdale teacher accused of sexual misconduct in West Virginia to remain in the classroom for two years while the two states` investigations plodded along, officials and documents now reveal.\\n\\nAn email obtained by The Arizona Republic shows West Virginia education officials told Arizona investigators in 2017 about sexual misconduct allegations in West Virginia against Pete Cheesebrough, a science teacher at Coronado High School.\\n\\nThe Arizona State Board of Education revoked Cheesebrough`s teaching certificate on Dec. 13. He worked at Coronado High School up until this month, when he resigned following an article by The Republic.\\n\\nIt took West Virginia more than a year and a half to discipline Cheesebrough, and then it took nearly another year for Arizona to take action. All that time, Cheesebrough continued teaching.\\n\\nThe Cheesebrough case exemplifies the loopholes teachers can slip through when they face allegations of sexual misconduct or abuse. In 2016, a USA TODAY investigation found more than 100 teachers who lost their teaching licenses, and more who simply lost their jobs, but were still working with children or young adults years later.\\n\\nDecades of cases:A New York teacher was accused of raping a student. He went on to teach elsewhere\\n\\nCheesebrough had resigned as assistant principal from a West Virginia school in May 2017 after he was accused of an inappropriate relationship with a teenage student. Both he and the student said they had kissed.\\n\\nThe Scottsdale Unified School District hired him a month later. Spokeswoman Nancy Norman earlier this month said his application did not indicate a pending investigation or any accusations lodged against him.\\n\\nHowever, Stefan Swiat, spokesman with the Arizona Department of Education, wrote in an email that its investigators notified the then-district superintendent about Cheesebrough in November 2017.\\n\\nSwiat said Arizona had to wait for West Virginia to discipline Cheesebrough before Arizona could take action against him.\\n\\n\"This is really a question for the West Virginia Department of Education and why it took that organization two years to complete its investigation,\" he wrote.\\n\\nIn Arizona, Swiat added, the Education Department is overwhelmed with cases of teacher misconduct.\\n\\nThe department`s investigative unit, tasked with investigating allegations of misconduct against educators, is staffed with four investigators.They have caseloads as high as 150.\\n\\nDavid Spelich, chief investigator, told state lawmakers in November the unit is \"drowning\" in cases. High caseloads prolong investigations.\\n\\n\"It`s eye-opening the amount of misconduct that our agency looks at,\" he said last month. \"It`s our utmost priority to make sure that none of us ever have to find out that a teacher slipped through the cracks.\"\\n\\n`Emotional` relationship with teen girl\\n\\nArizona State Board of Education documents characterize the alleged relationship between Pete Cheesebrough and a teenage student in West Virginia as an \"emotional relationship.\"\\n\\nThe student testified in a West Virginia hearing that, at age 16, she remembered thinking Cheesebrough had feelings for her.\\n\\nAt 18, she told him, \"I feel like you actually like me,\" according to the records. In response, the then-assistant principal \"moved next to her, put his hand on her leg, kissed her hand and gave her his phone number.\"\\n\\nHe also told her he masturbated thinking about students, according to documents obtained by the Charleston Gazette-Mail in West Virginia. She testified that she eventually felt like he had taken advantage of her.\\n\\nThey communicated via text message 86 times in a span of 13 days, investigators found. At one point, school principals called her into an office and asked her about her relationship with Cheesebrough, but documents indicate she lied about it at the time.\\n\\nAdministrators confronted Cheesebrough twice. In February 2017, he said he had never seen the student outside of school nor did he send her emails or text messages. Administrators warned him to stay away from the student.\\n\\nAfter the February meeting, he reportedly emailed the student, according to Arizona records.\\n\\nSocial media: A dangerous connection between teachers and students\\n\\nIn March 2017, he was placed on paid administrative leave. At a meeting that month, he told the district`s superintendent the student kissed him, but Cheesebrough told her it couldn`t happen again.\\n\\nCheesebrough resigned from the district a few months later. It would be another two years until West Virginia would suspend his administrative certificate. The state never revoked or suspended his teaching certificate.\\n\\nWest Virginia`s state police concluded no criminal wrongdoing in the case.\\n\\nIn June 2017, Scottsdale Unified hired Cheesebrough as a teacher.\\n\\nDiscipline took years\\n\\nOn Oct. 31, 2017, Garnett Burns, then-chief investigator with the Arizona Department of Education, emailed a West Virginia investigator to thank him for sending information on Cheesebrough, according to records obtained by The Arizona Republic.\\n\\n\"I do appreciate you contacting me so I have a head start on this and am able to prevent further issues in our schools here,\" she wrote.\\n\\nBut on Thursday, Swiat told The Republic in an email that Arizona could not complete its investigation until West Virginia completed its discipline process.\\n\\nWest Virginia`s schools superintendent suspended Cheesebrough`s administrator certificate in January 2019.\\n\\nThe West Virginia superintendent wrote the student exhibited \"the profile of the typical victim of boundary violations\" and that Cheesebrough tried to attack her credibility at the hearing by pointing out her vulnerabilities.\\n\\nReporting by the Charleston Gazette-Mail revealed officials in that state said they \"did not want to interfere with Cheesebrough`s new job in Arizona\" in explaining why they did not want to revoke his teaching certificate.\\n\\nBy then, Arizona officials had known about the West Virginia claims and Cheesebrough had worked at Coronado High for more than a year.\\n\\nNearly another year passed before the Arizona State Board took its own action.\\n\\nTaxed investigators\\n\\nSpelich, a retired Chicago Police Department homicide detective, said he accepted a job in the Arizona Department of Education investigative unit believing the new role wouldn`t be as busy as his old job.\\n\\nThat was a \"tactical\" error, he said in November.\\n\\nClaims of teacher sexual misconduct and other offenses start at Spelich’s unit. If investigators find the claim to be credible, they forward their findings to the State Board of Education for discipline.\\n\\nThe State Board votes on discipline: A teacher’s certificate can be revoked for five years, permanently revoked in the case of a criminal offense, or suspended for a number of years.\\n\\nAt any point in the process, an educator can voluntarily surrender his or her certificate.\\n\\nPosition of trust:Teachers accused of sex misconduct are investigated, but state falls short in protecting kids\\n\\nFour investigators plus Spelich and one administrative assistant work in the investigative unit. The number of misconduct cases has steadily risen since 2016 and is forecast to rise by another 30% in the next two years, according to the State Board.\\n\\nWhile the average caseload of the unit is 150 per investigator, Spelich said the ideal caseload is 50. Higher caseloads mean it takes longer for investigators to bring some cases in front of the board, potentially leaving an offender working in a school for months.\\n\\nArizona legislators seemed open to increasing state funding to hire more investigators. The Department of Education estimated four additional investigators and one added administrative assistant would cost $556,000 annually.\\n\\nThis would likely be part of the annual legislative budget process. The legislative session will begin in January.\\n\\nFollow Lily Altavena on Twitter: @LilyAlta Two states knew about a teacher`s sexual misconduct case, but let him teach for 2 years 12-2019', doc_id='8a177e64-cfce-4215-8701-b54d2e9c71fa', embedding=None, doc_hash='feb0d760ee80bb6e63ce73853f3a6d76cb4d75221c466997758af9412341c2ee', extra_info=None)\n",

It`s the number one stand mixer because it has so many interchangeable attachments that it can do almost anything and it will last for years and years to come.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThen you`ll need a high-quality, sturdy baking sheet—like our favorite from Nordic Ware. These baking sheets are lightweight yet large enough to hold more than a dozen cookies and produce evenly-baked cookies thanks to their superior heat distribution. Cassidy also suggests placing this silicone mat underneath your cookies to make for easy cleanup and to prevent your precious treats from getting burned on the bottom.\\n\\nAnd if you`re cutting out shapes from your dough, don`t forget the rolling pin. After testing a bunch of different ones, we found this wooden dowel to be the best because it rolled out dough perfectly every time and is easy to use so you can control the thickness of your cookies.\\n\\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

I’ll never embrace it. I don’t think it’s basketball. I think it’s a kind of circus act thing. Why don’t we have a 5-point shot? A 7-point shot?”\\n\\nSo we skip ahead to Dec. 12, when the locals seated in the Mexico City Arena for the Mavericks-Pistons game must’ve thought the game was muy loco. It was easy to figure out, like roulette and horseshoes, but it made little applicable sense.\\n\\nCommissioner Adam Silver attended, a peso for his thoughts, too.\\n\\nThis highest-level game appeared more like a light artillery firing range where opposing teams fire mortars into the air, hoping they fall near their targets.\\n\\nBut it’s too late to impress on the impressionable that this wasn’t basketball, but what the NBA’s version has been allowed to become.\\n\\nIn Dallas’ 122-111 win, 86 3-point shots were taken. Eighty-six. That was nearly half the game’s field-goal attempts. That’s basketball?\\n\\nKristaps Porzingis, now Dallas’ 7-foot-3 shooting guard, finished 0-for-5. Detroit’s 6-foot-10 Blake Griffin was 1-for-10.\\n\\nConsider that on that same date, Dec. 12, in 2005, the Lakers-Mavs game included 28 3-point attempts. The Pistons-Jazz game included 21.\\n\\nFourteen seasons later, 86. And 70-85 per game is less an exception than the norm. Heave, away, lads! Heave away!\\n\\nHere’s another diminished-by-design sport explained with the unfinished sentence: “The game has changed.”\\n\\nWhy even bother to look to hit the lead man on fast break when current NBA players are conditioned to not even bother but to loiter far from the basket, beyond the 3-point line?\\n\\nAn open 12-foot jumper? How quaint! Throw it outside for a 3.\\n\\nGive and go? Go where? Off to the far sides, behind the 3 line?\\n\\nThey don’t call steps or palming anymore to help facilitate drives to the basket, playing “above the rim” and slam-dunks, yet it’s the 3-point shot that rules.\\n\\nHeck, the only ones who still go wild after a made 3 is CBS/TNT’s “Hollerin’” Kevin Harlan and a kid in Cub Scout Troop Six.\\n\\nSo we continue to watch our sports devour themselves from the inside out, we’re left to wonder why, other than hunting for new revenue streams, the chosen leaders of those sports do nothing to facilitate relief let alone a cure.\\n\\nThe NFL: where there’s generational players every year\\n\\nAs reader Stephen Kraft notes, the new sounds-smart phrase for NFL draft experts — most simply appointed to the role — is “generational player,” as in he’s so good he appears just once every generation.\\n\\nYet, a “generational player” is appointed and anointed every year.\\n\\nsee also Why Chase Young can instantly transform Giants Urban Meyer has known Chase Young since his sophomore year...\\n\\nThe first time I heard “generational” applied to a future draft pick was on ESPN in 2012. After six games, nearly every ESPN expert had identified West Virginia quarterback Geno Smith as a lock for the Heisman Trophy and NFL star-in-waiting.\\n\\nSmith slumped soon after. That slump has persisted as an NFL QB, first with the Jets, then the Giants, then the Chargers. He’s now a backup with the Seahawks.\\n\\nAs for that Heisman, generational Geno didn’t even make the top-10 cut.\\n\\nNext, it was South Carolina defensive end Jadeveon Clowney, selected first by the Texans in the 2014 draft. He, too, was “a generational player” — even if he became expendable, traded to Seattle.\\n\\nNext? Saquon Barkley.\\n\\nNow there’s Ohio State defensive end Chase Young, this year’s “generational player.”\\n\\nWhy can’t experts stick with what they really know, such as replacing “jump” with “going vertical to high-point the football”?\\n\\nThe Yankees had no choice? They were bound by MLB’s reported $1 billion deal to wear Nike logos on their hallowed, untouchable jerseys?\\n\\nHow so? They could have simply refused their cut to remain true to their sacred tradition. What was MLB going to do about it other than increase its cut? Give the Yanks the death penalty? Who would the Red Sox have played on ESPN’s late, late Sunday night games?\\n\\nThere was nothing to prevent the Yankees from just saying no to Just Do It.\\n\\nYet apologists and marketing execs claimed that Nike logos affixed to Yanks uniforms is a way to attract kids.

      "Document(text='California leaders and advocacy groups share federal officials’ alarm over the state’s outsize role in that trend. But there’s significant disagreement over how to tackle the issue as the president singles out cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles as problems, clashing with a liberal state that often fights his policies.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe figures are from single-night surveys done in January. Nearly 568,000 people were counted as homeless across the country this year, according to HUD, representing a 2.7 percent increase over last year and a continuation of the reversal of steady declines in homelessness from 2010 to 2016. Still, homelessness nationwide is nearly 11 percent lower than it was in 2010 — though the homeless count in California is 22.5 percent higher today than it was nine years ago.\\n\\nThe latest numbers could fuel the Trump administration’s recent interest in combating homelessness in California, as the president decries damage to the “prestige” of the country’s cities and laments people living on its “best highways, our best streets, our best entrances to buildings.” Federal officials are considering creating new temporary facilities and refurbishing existing ones, along with the controversial measure of razing encampments, The Washington Post reported this fall.\\n\\nDivides over the best approach were on display Friday as Carson discussed the new homelessness numbers on “Fox & Friends,” criticizing local policies that let people sleep in public places as fueled by a “misguided concept of what compassion really is.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Compassion is getting that person into a situation where they can become self-sufficient,” Carson said, arguing that people allowed to sleep in the open have less incentive to seek out resources.\\n\\nHomeless advocates argue that shelters and other aid can’t meet the growing unsheltered population’s needs, even as some alarmed cities commit big new chunks of funding. Many champion a “housing first” approach — the idea that people need a place to live before they can stabilize their lives — as Trump appoints a new top homelessness official who has advocated “housing fourth,” wary of policies he says are “enabling” the people who are struggling.\\n\\n“Simply cracking down on homelessness without providing the housing people need is not a real solution,” San Francisco Mayor London Breed told CityLab earlier this year, speaking to a city where local media outlets have reported that the waiting list for shelters often tops 1,000 people.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nState and local leaders in California say they’re working hard to combat homelessness, allocating $1 billion this year for anti-homelessness programs in what Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) touted this month as the state’s biggest investment ever.\\n\\nThey’ve also questioned the Trump administration’s commitment to helping.\\n\\n“California is doing more than ever before to tackle the homelessness crisis, but every level of government, including the federal government, must step up and put real skin in the game,” Newsom said earlier this month.\\n\\nIn another seeming jab at the administration, the governor announced that California would be advised by Matthew Doherty — the Obama appointee ousted last month as head of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNeither HUD nor Newsom’s offices immediately responded to requests for comment Saturday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHomelessness is hard to quantify. Counts come from volunteers who spend one night in January surveying as many people as they can find, and the numbers they arrive at are likely incomplete: Research suggests that New York City’s count may catch just half of people living without shelter.\\n\\nExperts say California’s standout statistics stem from high housing costs as well as mental health and substance abuse problems and legal hurdles to getting people off the streets — all issues that could complicate federal officials’ ideas to stage an intervention, as The Post’s Scott Wilson reported earlier this year.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCarson, too, highlighted issues of affordability in his statement Friday, describing a rise in “street homelessness along our West Coast where the cost of housing is extremely high.”\\n\\nWhile HUD said California accounts for “more than the entire national increase” in homelessness this year, another Western state had a bigger jump from 2018 to 2019: New Mexico’s homeless population rose by 27 percent, according to federal data.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIdaho, West Virginia, Kentucky and Minnesota also saw increases above 10 percent, HUD said.\\n\\nAmid the discouraging trends, officials spotlighted some areas of improvement. The number of homeless veterans counted around the United States decreased by about 2 percent from last year — and has been cut in half since 2010, HUD said.

      "Document(text='Trump made 22 of the false claims at a campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania. He made 16 of them in a lengthy exchange with reporters during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.\\n\\nThe economy was Trump`s top subject of dishonesty, with 25 false claims. He made 22 false claims about military affairs, largely on account of his presence at a NATO summit. He made 15 false claims about NATO itself, 11 about impeachment.\\n\\nTrump is now averaging 63 false claims per week since we started counting at CNN on July 8, 2019. He made 38 false claims last week, 61 the week before.\\n\\nHe is now up to 1,450 total false claims since July 8. A breakdown of the lowlights from the last two weeks:\\n\\nThe most egregious false claim: An imaginary restraining order\\n\\nTrump has no shortage of factual ammunition for bashing former FBI senior counterintelligence official Peter Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who exchanged anti-Trump texts while being involved in the investigation into the Trump campaign`s relationship with Russia (and while having an affair).\\n\\nBut Trump is rarely satisfied with accurate attacks when he can do more damage to his foes` reputations with inaccurate ones. At his December 10 campaign rally in Pennsylvania, he alleged that one of either Strzok or Page had obtained a restraining order against the other.\\n\\nMost presidents try to limit their public storytelling to stories they know to be accurate. Not Trump, an eager purveyor of rumor and insinuation, he told the crowd: \"I don`t know if it`s true. The fake news will never report it. But it could be true. No, that`s what I heard, I don`t know.\"\\n\\nThere is not a hint of evidence that the story is true. Page tweeted that it was a \"lie.\"\\n\\nThe most revealing false claim: An assault in Maryland\\n\\nTrump comes to many of his rally speeches armed with graphic accounts of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. At the Pennsylvania rally, he recited accurate details of a horrifying recent Maryland case during which a man allegedly strangled and raped a woman who was trying to enter her apartment.\\n\\nThen, appearing to ad-lib for a moment, Trump said, \"She was raped and killed, strangled to death.\"\\n\\nThe victim was not killed. Police reported that doctors said she could have been killed by the strangulation, but she survived\\n\\nWe might be inclined to think Trump had made an innocent error had he not done this kind of needless exaggerating before. At one event last year, for example, he began to read out his text`s accurate claim that the MS-13 gang on Long Island, New Yorkhad called for the murder of a police officer, then decided to turn it into a false claim that MS-13 actually did murder the police officer.\\n\\nThe most absurd false claim: Rewriting campaign history\\n\\nTrump`s general approach to history: if you don`t like it, rewrite it.\\n\\nThe Louisiana governor candidate for whom Trump campaigned hard, Eddie Rispone, lost to incumbent John Bel Edwards by 2.7 percentage points. Trump claimed twice this month that Rispone lost by less than one percentage point.\\n\\nAnd that was not the month`s most egregious attempt to revise his political past. At the NATO summit, Trump told reporters that, with the exception of that race in Louisiana and another governor`s race in Kentucky, \"I`ve won virtually every race that I`ve participated in.\"\\n\\n\"Virtually\" is vague, but Trump was wrong however you slice things. He was omitting the defeats of two Alabama Senate candidates he had touted at rallies in 2017, a Virginia governor candidate he had repeatedly tweeted to promote in 2017, and a Pennsylvania congressional candidate and Montana and West Virginia Senate candidates he had promoted at rallies in 2018.\\n\\nHere`s the full list of 99 false claims, starting with the new ones we haven`t previously included in one of these roundups:\\n\\nForeign and military affairs\\n\\nThe Turkey-Syria border\\n\\n\"We pulled our soldiers out and we said, `You can patrol your own border now. I don`t care who you do it with, but we`re not going to have soldiers patrolling the border that`s been fought over for 2,000 years.`\" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron\\n\\n\"And I read a couple of stories just two days ago that, `Wow, that deal that Trump did with Turkey` -- because I want to get our soldiers out of there. I don`t want to be policing a border that`s been fought over for 2,000 years.\" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\\n\\nFacts First: There is no basis for the claim that there has been fighting over the Turkey-Syria border for 2,000 years; modern-day Turkey and Syria were both part of the Ottoman Empire that was only dissolved after World War, and the border between them is less than 100 years old.\\n\\n\"The border he refers to -- the Turkish-Syria border -- was established in 1923 with the Treaty of Lausanne and the founding of the Republic of Turkey. The exception to this is the province of Hatay, which passed from Syrian to Turkish control following a referendum,\" said Lisel Hintz, assistant professor of international relations and European studies at Johns Hopkins, who called Trump`s claims \"patently and irresponsibly false.\" Of the current conflict between Turkey and Kurdish groups based in Turkey and in Syria, Hintz added, \"Not only have these groups not been fighting over a border for 2,000 years, none of these groups or even the border in question existed 200 years ago.\"\\n\\nAugusta University history professor Michael Bishku said \"Trump is totally incorrect with his history.\"\\n\\nGermany`s military spending\\n\\n\"...Germany is paying 1 to 1.2% -- at max, 1.2% -- of a much smaller GDP. That`s not fair.\" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\\n\\nFacts First: Trump`s \"max\" figure for Germany`s defense spending was out of date. While Germany did spend 1.24% its gross domestic product (GDP) on defense in 2018, according to NATO : Trump`s \"max\" figure for Germany`s defense spending was out of date. While Germany did spend 1.24% its gross domestic product (GDP) on defense in 2018, according to NATO figures , Chancellor Angela Merkel`s government increased defense spending in 2019 to an estimated 1.38% of GDP, according to NATO -- still shy of the alliance`s 2% target, but higher than Trump said.\\n\\nTrump might have simply been unaware of the German increase, but it also appeared in NATO`s official report in June. (At that point, the alliance estimated that Germany would be at 1.36% of GDP this year.)\\n\\nMilitary spending by NATO members, part 1\\n\\nOn 10 separate instances, Trump made inaccurate claims about increases in military spending by NATO members. He claimed that: 1) He \"got NATO countries to pay 530 Billion Dollars a year more.\" 2) This increase in NATO spending will recur on an annual basis. 3) The increase will be $400 billion in \"three years.\"\\n\\nFacts First: Trump was inaccurate in all three ways. NATO says that, by 2024, non-US members will have spent a total of $400 billion more on defense than they did in 2016 -- not that they will be spending $400 billion more \"a year.\" Trump`s math was faulty when he added the $130 billion current increase over 2016 levels to the $400 billion increase expected by 2024; the $400 billion figure includes the $130 billion. And, again, the $400 billion increase is expected by 2024, not in \"three years.\"\\n\\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg explained during a meeting with Trump on December 3 that non-US NATO members have added a total of $130 billion to their defense budgets since 2016. By 2024, Stoltenberg said, \"this number will increase to $400 billion.\"\\n\\nNATO has made clear in public documents and statements that the $400 billion figure represents the planned cumulative spending increase for non-US members since 2016; NATO is not saying that these countries will be spending $400 billion more every year, as Trump suggested. NATO spokesman Matthias Eichenlaub pointed CNN to November comments in which Stoltenberg said that the $400 billion was an \"accumulated increase in defense spending by the end of 2024.\"\\n\\nWe won`t call Trump wrong when he takes credit for the spending increases, since Stoltenberg himself has repeatedly given him credit , but it`s worth noting that non-US members began boosting their defense budgets following Russia`s 2014 annexation of Ukraine`s Crimea and a 2014 NATO recommitment to the alliance`s target of having each member spend 2% of Gross Domestic Product on defense.\\n\\nMilitary spending by NATO members, part 2\\n\\n\"In the 3 decades before my election, NATO spending declined by two-thirds...\" -- December 2 tweet\\n\\nFacts First: There are numerous possible ways to interpret Trump`s vague claim, but we could not find any way to parse the data that resulted in a finding that \"NATO spending declined by two-thirds\" over the three decades prior to Trump`s election in 2016. Neither could two experts we asked to delve into the numbers.\\n\\n\"Short answer, this tweet makes no sense to me, and I don`t see any evidence backing up this `decline by two thirds` business,\" said Timothy Andrews Sayle, author of the book Enduring Alliance: A History of NATO and the Postwar Global Order and an assistant professor of history and director of the international relations program at the University of Toronto.\\n\\nExpert Pieter Wezeman, senior researcher in the arms and military expenditure program at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, noted that Trump might have been closer to correct had he said that the share of gross domestic product that European NATO members spent on defense declined by two-thirds in the three decades before his election. According to official NATO data , European NATO members were spending an average of 3.7% GDP on defense between 1980 and 1984 and 3.5% in 1986; the figure had dropped to about 1.5% in 2016, a reduction at least in the general vicinity of \"two-thirds.\"\\n\\nBut, again, Trump did not say the more-accurate version of the claim. And when you crunch the actual military spending by NATO members in various ways -- we won`t delve into all of the possible ways the experts said Trump`s comment could be interpreted -- there was nowhere near a two-thirds decline, both experts found.\\n\\nAccounting for inflation, official NATO data shows a decline well under one-third in military spending by non-US members between 1989, as the Cold War with the Soviet Union neared an end, and 2016. (NATO noted that additional countries were added to the alliance over that period, so it is not an apples-to-apples comparison.) Wezeman analyzed the data using only the NATO countries that were part of the alliance in 1986 and still found an inflation-adjusted decrease of well under one-third.\\n\\nCNN`s coverage of Middle East protests\\n\\nTrump said that, after he announced in 2017 that he would move the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, \"A day went by, and a second day went by, and there was no violence. I heard there was going to be massive violence. They showed violence -- because about 20 people were violent in the front row, but there was nobody behind them. So CNN had the cameras very low, pointing to the sky ... They said, `Massive crowds have gathered. Massive crowds.` And I looked, I said, `That`s a strange angle. I`ve never seen that angle.` It was like -- you had a cameraman sitting on the floor pointing up. But every once in a while, you say, `There`s nobody behind the people in the front row. What`s going on?` And it was a con. It was fake news as usual.\" -- December 7 speech to the Israeli American Council National Summit\\n\\nFacts First: CNN`s coverage of these 2017 protests did not use deceptive camera angles or exaggerate the size of the crowds. (FactCheck.org, which conducted its own : CNN`s coverage of these 2017 protests did not use deceptive camera angles or exaggerate the size of the crowds. (FactCheck.org, which conducted its own in-depth review of CNN`s coverage, also found no evidence for Trump`s claims.)\\n\\nIt is possible Trump was referring to a CNN report from the West Bank on December 7, 2017, the day after Trump`s announcement about the embassy. The camera bobbed upward and downward during the last portion of segment -- but only because the photojournalist carrying the camera was running from tear gas being used by Israeli forces.\\n\\nCNN reporter Ian Lee, who now works for CBS, said in the report that \"you are seeing a lot of people go out in the street and voice their anger,\" but Lee did not describe the crowds as \"massive.\" CNN`s article on the day`s protests, written by Lee and two others, included the following sentences: \"Speaking in Jerusalem, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told CNN that protests there were relatively small and had been largely contained. `We`ve dealt with much larger, both in terms of number, scale, size, seriousness of incidents.`\"\\n\\nIn a December 12, 2017, report on subsequent West Bank protests, CNN senior international correspondent Arwa Damon said, \"The number of Palestinians who have taken to the streets remains, relatively speaking, low.\" She said that the clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces were \"in fact, a little muted, at least by what the expectations were.\"\\n\\nTrump is correct that there was not major violence at protests immediately following his December 2017 announcement, but there was at protests on the day the Jerusalem embassy was officially opened in May 2018. The New York Times reported that day: \"By late in the evening, 58 Palestinians, including several teenagers, had been killed and more than 1,350 wounded by gun fire, the (Israeli) Health Ministry said. Israeli soldiers and snipers used barrages of tear gas as well as live gunfire to keep protesters from entering Israeli territory. The Israeli military said that some in the crowds were planting or hurling explosives, and that many were flying flaming kites into Israel; at least one kite outside the Nahal Oz kibbutz, near Gaza City, ignited a wildfire.\"\\n\\nImpeachment\\n\\nAdam Schiff`s comments and defamation law\\n\\n\"This guy is sick. He made up the conversation. He lied. If he didn`t do that in the halls of Congress, he`d be thrown into jail. But he did it in the halls of Congress, and he`s given immunity.\" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\\n\\nFacts First: Trump was correct that Rep. Adam Schiff : Trump was correct that Rep. Adam Schiff has legal immunity under the Constitution for comments he made at a House committee meeting in September about Trump`s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. (We`ve written that those comments were at least confusing .) However, Trump was wrong when he said Schiff would be \"thrown into jail\" if he had made these comments outside of Congress.\\n\\nLet`s temporarily set aside the question of the accuracy or inaccuracy of Schiff`s remarks. Apart the fact that it would be exceedingly unusual for an elected official to be criminally prosecuted for offering a rendition of the President`s comments, even an inaccurate rendition, there is no law under which Schiff might conceivably be charged: as PolitiFact noted , there is no criminal defamation law in Washington, D.C. (where Schiff was speaking), in California (Schiff`s home state), or in federal law.\\n\\nA quote from Fox News, part 1\\n\\n\"`The Democrats haven`t come up with a smocking (sic.) gun. Nancy Pelosi, by raising this to the level of Impeachment, has raised the bar impossibly high.

I think it is really a hard sell for Nancy Pelosi.` @DanHenninger The Wall Street Journal.\" -- December 8 tweet\\n\\nFacts First: Trump omitted the portion of Henninger`s : Trump omitted the portion of Henninger`s comments on Fox News in which Henninger said things less favorable to Trump -- such as that the House of Representatives could have voted to censure him for trying to get Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden. In between the sentences Trump quoted, Henninger said, \"Everyone can agree or disagree about the rightness or wrongness of what Donald Trump did with the president of Ukraine, intervening, trying to get him to investigate Joe Biden. And indeed that`s a voteable issue; voters can make up their minds about that, and indeed the House could have voted to censure Donald Trump, the will of the House being that this is wrong.\"\\n\\nWe give Trump significant latitude to make errors when quoting people on television, but we call it a false claim when he alters the meaning of the quote with major changes or omissions.\\n\\nA quote from Fox News, part 2\\n\\n\"`The American people are going to see this for what it is. It is a political effort by the Democrats, and the President certainly doesn`t have to aid in the Impeachment effort.` Robert Ray @MariaBartiromo\" -- December 2 tweet\\n\\nFacts First: Trump again omitted an unfavorable and significant part of the quote. This time, he left out Ray saying that Democrats may (or may not) be correct that impeachment will help their chances in the 2020 election.\\n\\nHere`s what Ray said on Fox News, with the key Trump omission in italics: \"I think the American people are going to see this for what it is. I think they do understand at bottom that this is a political effort. The Democrats have made a calculation that this is their best way forward in order to maximize their chances in the 2020 election.

But the President certainly doesn`t have to aid in the Impeachment effort.\"\\n\\nElections\\n\\nThe Louisiana governor race\\n\\n\"And after getting them into a runoff, he picked up 14 points because they thought he was going to lose to a popular governor -- John Bel Edwards.

He lost by less than a point.\" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\\n\\n\"And Louisiana was a long shot. It was less than 1%.

Trump may have been referring to a single poll, a month before the vote, that had Rispone down 16 points, but most polls had the race in the single digits.)\\n\\nTrump`s campaign history\\n\\n\"But with the exception of those two races (in Louisiana and Kentucky), where I had a huge impact because I raised them up almost to victory and they had no chance -- with the exception of those two, I`ve won virtually every race that I`ve participated in.\" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\\n\\nFacts First: Though many of the Republican candidates for whom Trump has campaigned have gone on to win, it`s not true that Trump has won \"virtually every race\" in which he has participated.

Horowitz emphasized the seriousness of these mistakes in his December report and congressional testimony.\\n\\nBut Horowitz did not find evidence that the department or the FBI in particular were attempting some sort of coup -- nor even that there had been intentional misconduct. Horowitz found that the FBI had a legitimate basis to open the investigation into the Trump campaign`s relationship with Russia and that the decisions to investigate the campaign and individual campaign aides were not driven by political bias.\\n\\nDuring Horowitz`s congressional testimony, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal asked him, \"Is there any evidence that you found that the FBI tried to overthrow the president?\" Horowitz responded, \"No, we found the issues we identified here.

No, that`s what I heard, I don`t know.\" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania\\n\\nFacts First: There is no evidence that either Strzok or Page ever obtained or sought a restraining order against the other. Page : There is no evidence that either Strzok or Page ever obtained or sought a restraining order against the other. Page said on Twitter: \"This is a lie. Nothing like this ever happened.\"\\n\\nImmigration\\n\\nDeportations to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador\\n\\n\"And Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador -- we signed a very important agreement with each. When their people come into our country, they weren`t taking them back. Now they take them back and they say, thank you very much. They weren`t taking them back. If we had a murderer from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, we want to bring them back -- under past administrations, they bring them, they said, `We don`t want them. Don`t land your plane with us.` They say, `Thank you very much. We will take them back.` Because we`ve let them know the price is very bad if they don`t do that.\" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania.\\n\\nFacts First: Trump was mixing up two separate issues. While the Trump administration does have : Trump was mixing up two separate issues. While the Trump administration does have new agreements with all three countries, those agreements are related to the handling of people who come to the US seeking asylum, not criminals the US is seeking to deport. In 2016, just prior to Trump`s presidency, none of the three countries was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered \"recalcitrant\" (uncooperative) in accepting the return of their citizens from the US.\\n\\nRandy Capps, director of research for US programs at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington think tank, confirmed that Trump was \"confusing\" different things. Capps said Trump was \"way off base\" on this claim.\\n\\nCapps noted that in the 2016 fiscal year, the last full year before Trump took office, ICE reported that Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador ranked second, third and fourth for the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. The same was true in the 2017 fiscal year , which encompassed the end of Barack Obama`s presidency and the beginning of Trump`s. ICE did not identify any widespread problems with deportations to these countries.\\n\\nIn July 2016, ICE deputy director Daniel Ragsdale testified to Congress that there were some exceptions to the rule: \"It is important to note that while countries may generally be cooperative, sometimes they may delay or refuse the repatriation of certain individuals. For example, El Salvador, a country that is generally cooperative, has recently delayed the issuance of a number of travel documents where there is no legal impediment to removal.\"\\n\\nSo Trump could have accurately made a less sweeping claim. But he was exaggerating when he declared that the three countries simply \"weren`t taking them back.\"\\n\\nAn arrest in Maryland\\n\\n\"Since Montgomery County, Maryland declared itself a sanctuary jurisdiction in July, we have already identified nine illegal aliens who have been arrested for rape, sexual assault, including a 26-year-old man charged with raping and viciously strangling a young, wonderful woman, who was entering her apartment, innocently entering her apartment. She was raped and killed, strangled to death.\" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania\\n\\nFacts First: The victim in this August case was not killed. The Washington Post : The victim in this August case was not killed. The Washington Post reported that the victim \"was taken to a hospital for her injuries. Police said in a statement that `doctors advised detectives that the severity of the strangulation the victim suffered could have resulted in her death.`\"\\n\\nTrump was correct that nine undocumented immigrants have been charged with rape or sexual assault in this Maryland county since July, according to local media reports and a September tweet from Ken Cuccinelli, acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.\\n\\nDemocrats\\n\\nBeto O`Rourke and religion\\n\\n\"We had one candidate who turned out not to be too good a candidate, right? Beto. Beto. Remember? So he wanted to get rid of religion -- the Bible.\" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania\\n\\nFacts First: Unsuccessful Democratic presidential candidate Beto O`Rourke, the former Texas congressman, never proposed to \"get rid of religion\" or the Bible.\\n\\nO`Rourke sparked controversy by proposing to strip tax-exempt status from religious institutions, including churches, that oppose same-sex marriage. O`Rourke said \"there can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break\" for any entity \"that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us.\"\\n\\nTrump is free to criticize O`Rourke`s proposal as a violation of the First Amendment, but it`s a major exaggeration to claim that proposing to strip certain churches` tax exemptions is the same as proposing to eradicate religion or the Bible.\\n\\nElizabeth Warren`s wealth tax\\n\\n\"You`re not going to vote for Pocahontas, I can tell you that. You`re not going to vote for the wealth tax. `Yeah, let`s take 100% of your wealth away.`\" -- December 7 speech to the Israeli American Council National Summit\\n\\nFacts First: Warren is not proposing to take away 100% of anyone`s wealth. Her wealth tax : Warren is not proposing to take away 100% of anyone`s wealth. Her wealth tax proposal is for \"an annual 2% tax on every dollar of net worth above $50 million and a 6% tax on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion.\"\\n\\nElizabeth Warren`s health care plan\\n\\n\"Her ridiculous plan would cost $52 trillion. That`s more money than we take in in one year, two years, three years, four years, five years, six years -- about seven years. That`s for one year, $52 trillion.\" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania\\n\\nFacts First: Warren`s campaign says her Medicare-for-All proposal would require a total of $52 trillion in health care spending : Warren`s campaign says her Medicare-for-All proposal would require a total of $52 trillion in health care spending over 10 years , not one year. (The Urban Institute think tank estimates that $52 trillion is also the amount that would be spent on health care under current law.) Trump is free to question the Warren campaign`s financial assumptions, but $52 trillion for one year is inaccurate.\\n\\nTrump was also inaccurate when he suggested that $52 trillion is \"about seven years\" worth of federal revenue. The federal government took in $3.3 trillion in 2018; at that level, $52 trillion would actually represent about 16 years` worth of federal receipts. Trump might have been attempting to refer to how Warren`s proposal would require $20.5 trillion in new spending by the federal government over the next decade; that is roughly six years of federal revenues at the present level, so Trump would be much closer to correct.\\n\\nWarren has proposed a variety of ways to generate the $20.5 trillion, including higher taxes on wealthy people, increased corporate taxes, improved tax enforcement, new employer fees, and new payments from state and local governments.\\n\\nEconomy\\n\\nThe stock market\\n\\nTrump was asked about the Dow falling 400 points early that day, December 3, in apparent response to comments he made earlier in the day about the state of trade talks with China. He responded, \"Well it`s up -- let me tell you. We took it up -- it was about at 16,000 or 15,000. And now it`s almost at 30,000. It`s gonna be at 30,000.\" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\\n\\nFacts First: The Dow has increased by more than a third during Trump`s presidency, but he was exaggerating where it started. The Dow opened (and closed) just under 20,000 points on the day of his inauguration, not at 15,000 or 16,000. If you go back to the day of his election, as Trump prefers to do, the Dow was over 18,000 points.\\n\\nThe Dow closed over 27,000 on December 3.\\n\\nNovember jobs expectations\\n\\n\"The numbers came out, as you saw on Friday, with a number of jobs that nobody believed possible: 200 -- well over 200,000. They were thinking about 50. Some people thought it would be 50,000, 60,000.\" -- December 9 remarks at roundtable on school choice\\n\\n\"It was announced that 266,000 jobs were added in November. And that shattered all expectations. They were thinking about 70,000. They were thinking about 90,000 -- which isn`t so bad. Two hundred and sixty-six thousand.\" -- December 7 speech to the Israeli American Council National Summit/\\n\\n\"Just last week, we announced that we smashed expectations and created 266,000 jobs in November -- a number that was unthinkable a day before. A day before, they were guessing, `Would it be 80? Would it be 90? Would it be 160?` Somebody said -- an optimist. And this was 266,000...\" -- December 12 speech at White House Summit on Child Care and Paid Leave\\n\\nFacts First: While the number of jobs added by the US economy in November, 266,000, did exceed analysts` expectations, those expectations were much higher than Trump claimed. The : While the number of jobs added by the US economy in November, 266,000, did exceed analysts` expectations, those expectations were much higher than Trump claimed. The median estimate from economists surveyed by Reuters was 180,000 jobs added -- and the lowest of the economists` estimates was 120,000 jobs added. (So one of Trump`s many figures, the \"160,000,\" does fall within the range of estimates.)\\n\\nTrump did not specify who he was talking about when he repeatedly referred to an unnamed \"they\"; it is certainly plausible that somebody somewhere thought that a mere 50,000, 60,000, 70,000, 80,000 or 90,000 jobs would be added. But Trump created the impression that he was talking about the expectations of economic experts.\\n\\nThe currencies of Brazil and Argentina\\n\\n\"Brazil and Argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies. which is not good for our farmers. Therefore, effective immediately, I will restore the Tariffs on all Steel & Aluminum that is shipped into the U.S. from those countries. The Federal Reserve should likewise act so that countries, of which there are many, no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies.\" -- December 2 tweet\\n\\nFacts First: While the Brazilian real and the Argentinian peso had : While the Brazilian real and the Argentinian peso had declined against the US dollar in the weeks prior to Trump`s announcement, and for the year, experts say there was no evidence either country had been intentionally devaluing either currency. To the contrary, \"the evidence shows that Argentina and Brazil have been trying to do the opposite of what President Trump accuses,\" said Paul Angelo, fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"In fact, this year alone the Brazilian government has repeatedly intervened to slow devaluation of the real and Argentina has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in August trying to shield the peso following a political shock .\"\\n\\nThe Wall Street Journal reported after Trump`s announcement: \"...few economists and analysts agreed with Mr. Trump`s claim that the two countries have been manipulating their currencies...Neither Brazil nor Argentina has been featured in the U.S. Treasury Department`s currency report, the official vehicle for designating nations as manipulators.\" Bloomberg reported : \"While it`s true the Brazilian real and Argentine peso have weakened against the greenback this year, policy makers in Brasilia and Buenos Aires appear worried rather than happy about this. `Trump should be thanking Brazil and Argentina,` said Andre Perfeito, chief economist at Necton, a Sao Paulo-based brokerage. `Their governments have adopted measures that seek to rein in the depreciation of their currencies.`\"\\n\\nRussian energy production\\n\\nClaiming that Russia wishes he had lost the election, Trump said, \"We are now number one in the world in energy; Russia`s number three. We`re beating out Russia and Saudi Arabia.\" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania\\n\\nFacts First: Russia was second in the world in petroleum and natural gas production every year from 2014 through 2018, far exceeding the production of third-place Saudi Arabia in each of those years, according to an August : Russia was second in the world in petroleum and natural gas production every year from 2014 through 2018, far exceeding the production of third-place Saudi Arabia in each of those years, according to an August report from the US government`s Energy Information Administration. (Russia was in first place from 2008 through 2013.)\\n\\nIf you include \"biofuels, and refinery processing gain, among other liquid fuels\" in the count, as the Energy Information Administration did in a 2017 analysis , the US became number one in the world in 2012, not 2014. Regardless, Russia has consistently been in second place by this broader measure as well since the US became number .\\n\\nNo matter which measure you use, Trump`s use of the word \"now\" is arguably misleading. The US has been number one since the presidency of Barack Obama, whom Trump has repeatedly accused of perpetrating a \"war on American energy.\"\\n\\nThe American and Chinese economies\\n\\n\"We`re much larger than China now, because we`ve gone up and they`ve gone down.\" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\\n\\nFacts First: The US has not just \"now\" become a larger economy than China; that was also the case before Trump took office. And China continues to close the gap: while China`s economy is growing at its : The US has not just \"now\" become a larger economy than China; that was also the case before Trump took office. And China continues to close the gap: while China`s economy is growing at its slowest rate since 1992 , It is still reporting growth greater than that of the US.\\n\\nChina reported 6% economic growth in the third quarter of 2019; the US reported 2.1% third-quarter growth. China`s official figures are not always reliable, but there is no doubt that growth is occurring. In October, the International Monetary Fund predicted 6.1% growth from China in 2019 and 5.8% growth in 2020.\\n\\nGlobal warming and the oceans\\n\\nMocking fears about global warming, Trump said, \"The ocean`s going to rise. One eighth of an inch within the next 250 years. We`re going to be wiped out!\" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania\\n\\nFacts First: Trump was greatly understating scientists` estimates of rising sea levels. Even in 80 years, the United Nations` Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change expects sea levels to rise by a foot or more.\\n\\nAs FactCheck.org noted , a September report from the UN panel estimated an increase in the global mean sea level by about 1 feet to 2 feet over 1986-2005 levels by 2100 -- even under a lower-carbon-emissions scenario; the report projected much higher increases in a scenario in which emissions were higher. \"Under a higher emissions scenario, the report said, 2 to 3.5 feet of sea level rise are expected,\" FactCheck.org noted. \"By 2300 -- three decades after the president`s timeframe -- sea level rise is likely to be 2 to 3.5 feet, even under lower emissions, according to the IPCC report. With higher emissions, the likely range is between a whopping 7.5 to 18 feet.\"\\n\\nHere are the claims Trump made over these two weeks that we have previously fact checked in one of these weekly roundups:\\n\\nUkraine and impeachment\\n\\nThe timing of Rep. Adam Schiff`s comments\\n\\n\"He made up my statement, because -- see, I did one thing very good. As soon as I heard about this deal, I released my statement immediately. But he had already made horrible statements.\" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania\\n\\nFacts First: Trump can reasonably criticize Schiff for Schiff`s comments at a House Intelligence Committee hearing in September; as we`ve written before, Schiff`s mix of near-quotes from Trump`s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, his own analysis, and supposed \"parody\" was at the very least confusing. But Schiff spoke the day after Trump released the rough transcript, not before Trump released the transcript.\\n\\nThe accuracy of the whistleblower\\n\\n\"By the way, the whistleblower: the whistleblower defrauded our country, because the whistleblower wrote something that was totally untrue...They wrote something totally different from what I said.\" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania\\n\\n\"The whistleblower wrote a totally false statement. So it`s a fraud.\" -- December 13 exchange with reporters at meeting with Paraguayan President Description Mario Abdo Benítez\\n\\nFacts First: The whistleblower`s account of Trump`s call with Zelensky has largely been proven accurate. In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower`s three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. (You can read a full fact check : The whistleblower`s account of Trump`s call with Zelensky has largely been proven accurate. In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower`s three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. (You can read a full fact check here .)\\n\\nThe rough transcript\\n\\n\"They didn`t even know, probably, that we had it transcribed, professionally transcribed, word-for-word transcribed, so beautiful.\" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania\\n\\nFacts First: The document released by the White House explicitly says, on the first page, that it is not an exact transcript of Trump`s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\\n\\nThe National Security Council`s top Ukraine expert, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, testified to Congress that he tried to make edits to the document to include two things that were said on the call but not included in the document. Vindman testified that the document was \"substantively correct,\" but he made clear that it was not a verbatim account.\\n\\nThe whistleblower being \"gone\"\\n\\n\"Where`s the whistleblower? He`s disappeared, he`s gone...the whistleblower is gone. He flew the coop because he reported incorrectly...\" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania\\n\\n\"But once I released it, all of a sudden the second whistleblower disappeared. The first whistleblower, who was all set to testify, he -- all of a sudden, he becomes this saint-like figure that they don`t need him anymore. The one that everybody wanted to see, including Schiff, was the whistleblower. Once I released the text of what happened -- the transcript -- that was the end. Everybody disappeared. So now there`s no informer. There`s no second whistleblower. Everybody has gone.\" -- December 13 exchange with reporters at meeting with Paraguayan President Description Mario Abdo Benítez\\n\\nFacts First: There is no evidence that either the first whistleblower (who filed the complaint about Trump`s dealings with Ukraine) or the second whistleblower (whose lawyers said they had firsthand information corroborating claims made by the first whistleblower) are now somehow \"gone,\" let alone that they are \"gone\" because the first whistleblower was shown to be inaccurate.\\n\\n\"The whistleblowers have not vanished,\" Bradley Moss, a colleague of Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the two whistleblowers, said on Twitter in October, when Trump made another version of this claim.\\n\\nThe first whistleblower`s lawyers, Zaid and Andrew Bakaj, wrote in the Washington Post in October: \"Because our client has no additional information about the president`s call, there is no justification for exposing their identity and all the risks that would follow.\"\\n\\nThe existence of the second whistleblower -- who never planned to file a separate whistleblower complaint -- was revealed after Trump released the rough transcript of his call with Zelensky, not before.\\n\\nEuropean assistance to Ukraine\\n\\n\"The other thing nobody remembers and nobody likes to talk about -- and I talk about it all the time -- is why isn`t Germany, why isn`t France, why aren`t other European countries paying? Because we`re paying. The suckers... Why aren`t European countries paying? Why isn`t France paying a lot of money? Why is it always the United States?\" -- December 13 exchange with reporters at meeting with Paraguayan President Description Mario Abdo Benítez\\n\\nFacts First: European countries, including France and Germany, have provided hundreds of millions of dollars` worth of assistance to Ukraine since Russia`s invasion in 2014.\\n\\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged European \"help\" during his meeting with Trump at the United Nations in September, though he said the world`s efforts had been inadequate so far: \"And, I`m sorry, but we don`t need help; we need support. Real support. And we thank -- thank everybody, thank all of the European countries; they each help us. But we also want to have more -- more.\"\\n\\nYou can read a full fact check here\\n\\nZelensky`s comments\\n\\n\"Breaking News: The President of Ukraine has just again announced that President Trump has done nothing wrong with respect to Ukraine and our interactions or calls.\" -- December 2 tweet\\n\\n\"The Ukrainian president came out and said, very strongly, that `President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong.`\" -- December 2 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure\\n\\n\"I had a very, very good conversation with the head of Ukraine. And, by the way, yesterday, he came out again and reaffirmed again that we had a very, very respectful, good conversation -- that President Trump did nothing wrong.\" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\\n\\nFacts First: Trump was : Trump was mischaracterizing Zelensky`s comments in an interview published by Time magazine. Zelensky did not say Trump \"did nothing wrong.\"\\n\\nAsked about \"this issue of the quid pro quo\" with regard to US military aid to Ukraine and the investigations Trump and his allies wanted, Zelensky responded, \"Look, I never talked to the President from the position of a quid pro quo. That`s not my thing.\" But Zelensky continued: \"I don`t want us to look like beggars. But you have to understand. We`re at war. If you`re our strategic partner, then you can`t go blocking anything for us. I think that`s just about fairness. It`s not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.\"\\n\\nTrump is entitled to tout Zelensky`s statement about not talking to Trump \"from the position of a quid pro quo,\" but those words aren`t equivalent to Zelensky saying Trump did nothing wrong.\\n\\nImpeachment hearings\\n\\nTrump complained about an impeachment hearing that the House Judiciary Committee had scheduled, then said, \"For the hearings, we don`t get a lawyer, we don`t get any witnesses.\" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\\n\\nFacts First: Unlike the impeachment inquiry hearings that were held in November by the House Intelligence Committee, Trump was allowed to have his lawyer participate in the House Judiciary Committee proceedings in December. Trump declined the offer to have a lawyer appear at the particular hearing he was complaining about here, during which four constitutional law scholars appeared. Also, a Republican lawyer was permitted to question witnesses at the House Intelligence Committee hearings, though Trump`s own lawyers were not.\\n\\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone said in a letter to Democratic House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler that \"an invitation to an academic discussion with law professors does not begin to provide the President with any semblance of a fair process.\"\\n\\nThough the Democrats got to control the witness lists, since they hold the House majority, the House Intelligence Committee did hear testimony from three former officials whom Republicans had requested as witnesses: Kurt Volker, the former special representative for Ukraine; Tim Morrison, former National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia; and David Hale, undersecretary of state for political affairs.\\n\\nEconomy\\n\\nIvanka Trump and jobs\\n\\n\"Fourteen million people she`s gotten jobs for, where she would go into Walmart, she would go into our great companies and say, `They really want help. They really want you to teach them,` because the government can`t teach like the companies can teach. And companies would take a half a million people, a million people. And her goal when she started it two years ago was 500,000 jobs; she`s done over 14 million.\" -- December 12 speech at White House Summit on Child Care and Paid Leave\\n\\nFacts First: Ivanka Trump has obviously not \"gotten jobs for\" 14 million people. At the time, roughly 7 million jobs had been created during the entire Trump presidency.\\n\\nTrump was referring to the White House`s Pledge to America`s Workers initiative, in which Ivanka Trump has sought to get companies to commit to providing \"education and training opportunities\" for workers. As of Wednesday, companies had promised to create 14.4 million opportunities -- but many of these opportunities are internal training programs, not new jobs. Also, as CNN has previously reported, many of the companies had already planned these opportunities before Ivanka Trump launched the initiative.\\n\\nUnemployment\\n\\n\"We have the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers. We have the best numbers we`ve ever had in our country.\" -- December 10 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure\\n\\nFacts First: The unemployment rates for some demographic groups are at their lowest levels \"ever,\" but the overall unemployment rate is not -- though it is indeed impressively low.\\n\\nThe overall rate was 3.5% in November -- the lowest since 1969, with the exception of the 3.5% rate in September, but well above the record 2.5% set in 1953.\\n\\nUnemployment for women\\n\\nIn two separate instances, Trump said that women`s unemployment is \"at a record number\" and that it is \"the lowest in 71 years.\"\\n\\nFacts First: The unemployment rate for women was not a \"record,\" nor the lowest in \"71 years.\" It had been 66 years, not 71 years, since the women`s unemployment rate has been as low as it was in November, : The unemployment rate for women was not a \"record,\" nor the lowest in \"71 years.\" It had been 66 years, not 71 years, since the women`s unemployment rate has been as low as it was in November, 3.5% . (That`s if you ignore the 3.4% in September and April.)\\n\\nThe steel industry\\n\\n\"And the steel companies are doing incredibly well. They were finished.\" And \"...they were ready to close up -- all of them -- and now they`re doing great.\" -- December 9 remarks at roundtable on school choice\\n\\n\"But the steel industry, in particular, was -- we weren`t going to have a steel industry...Everything was closing down.\" -- December 6 remarks at roundtable on small business and red tape\\n\\nFacts First: The US steel industry was not \"finished\" before Trump imposed his tariffs on imported steel, nor was \"everything\" shutting down. While some American steel companies were struggling, not \"all of them\" were anywhere close to closing. In fact, some major companies were thriving.\\n\\nBloomberg reported in an October 2018 fact check: \"In fact, U.S. steelmakers Nucor Corp. and Steel Dynamics Inc. were two of the healthiest commodity companies in the world before Trump took office.\"\\n\\nThere is no doubt that the steel industry had declined from its heyday: the number of people working in iron and steel mills or in making steel products fell from more than 250,000 in 1990 to under 150,000 by 2016. Still, \"finished\" is an exaggeration. In 2016 , the US produced about as much raw steel as it did at various points in the 1980s.\\n\\nSteel plants\\n\\n\"And now the steel industry -- if you look at what`s going on, the industry is doing incredibly well. They`re building a lot of extensions. They`re building brand-new plants where they never...they never built a new plant. I mean, they hadn`t built one in years, and now they`re building new plants all over the country.\" -- December 6 remarks at roundtable on small business and red tape\\n\\nFacts First: While some steel plants were closing, being idled or otherwise doing poorly before Trump took office and before Trump imposed his tariffs on steel imports, some other plants were being built or expanding at the time.\\n\\nA simple Google search brings up numerous 2015 announcements about planned investments in steel plants. For example, Steel Dynamics announced a $100 million expansion at a mill in Mississippi. Commercial Metals announced a $250 million investment to build a micro-mill in Oklahoma. Nucor and a partner announced a $75 million investment in improvements at a mill in Arkansas. Ferrous CAL announced a $53 million investment in a Michigan plant to make steel for automotive companies.\\n\\nEnergy production\\n\\n\"We ended the last administration`s war on American energy. The United States is now -- and I said it, and I`ll say it all night long, number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And there`s nobody even close.\" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania\\n\\nFacts First: The US has not just \"now\" become the world`s top energy producer: it took the top spot : The US has not just \"now\" become the world`s top energy producer: it took the top spot in 2012 , according to the US government`s Energy Information Administration -- under the very Obama administration Trump is accusing of perpetrating a \"war\" on the industry.\\n\\nThe US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump`s tenure. \"The United States has been the world`s top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world`s top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia`s,\" the Energy Information Administration says\\n\\nWage growth\\n\\n\"...more importantly than anything, wages are up for the first time in many, many years, decades, decades.\" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania\\n\\nFacts First: Wages have been rising since 2014, using one common measure.\\n\\nThere are various ways to measure wage growth. Median usual weekly earnings, one way that is frequently cited , began increasing in mid-2014 -- though slowly -- after a decline that began in the recession year of 2009. Median usual weekly warnings went from $330 per week in the second quarter of 2014 to $349 per week in the fourth quarter of 2016.\\n\\nTrump can accurately boast that wage growth during his presidency has been faster than under Obama, but he is wrong to suggest it was declining before he took office.\\n\\nObama and manufacturing jobs\\n\\n\"And the previous administration said -- manufacturing -- `you`d need the magic wand.` You know, we`ve all heard the statement. But they basically said it was a dead business, when in fact it`s one of the most important sets of jobs I think you can have anywhere.\" -- December 6 remarks at roundtable on small business and red tape\\n\\nFacts First: Trump`s \"magic wand\" comment was a reference to a remark President Barack Obama made at a PBS : Trump`s \"magic wand\" comment was a reference to a remark President Barack Obama made at a PBS town hall in 2016. Obama scoffed at Trump`s promises to bring back what Obama called \"jobs of the past\" without providing specifics on how he would do so. Contrary to Trump`s claims, though, Obama didn`t say manufacturing was dead or that new manufacturing jobs could not be created; Obama boasted of how many manufacturing jobs were being created during his presidency, saying, \"We actually make more stuff, have a bigger manufacturing base today than we`ve had in most of our history.\"\\n\\nMedian household income and energy\\n\\n\"With President Trump, it (median household income) went up $5,000, but whoa, whoa, whoa, in less than three years. That`s a big thing. Wait. And then when you add energy savings and you add tax savings, you have almost a $10,000 gain in three years.\" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania\\n\\nFacts First: There is no basis for Trump adding an additional $5,000 to the initial $5,000 in household income growth he is asserting. (That initial $5,000 figure is based on the findings of a firm called Sentier Research). It is entirely unclear what Trump is referring to when he talks about \"energy savings\"; household energy costs have increased since Trump took office, as have gasoline costs. (Gasoline costs are lower than they were for most of Obama`s presidency, but higher than they were in 2016.)\\n\\nYou can read a longer fact check here\\n\\nChina and trade\\n\\nChina`s economic performance\\n\\nIn three separate instances, Trump said that China is having its worst economic year \"in 57 years,\" \"in 56 or 57 years now,\" and \"in at least 57\" years, \"much more than that.\"\\n\\nFacts First: China`s second-quarter GDP growth of 6.2% and third-quarter GDP growth of 6% were its : China`s second-quarter GDP growth of 6.2% and third-quarter GDP growth of 6% were its worst since 1992 , 27 years ago. Trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that 27 years is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason.\\n\\nWho is paying for Trump`s tariffs on China\\n\\n\"And now we`re taking in billions of dollars in tariffs. And, by the way, they`re eating it. You know, remember, you used to tell me how it will cost us -- they`re eating that money because they don`t want to lose their supply chains.\" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\\n\\nFacts First: Study after study , including a report in late November from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has shown that Americans are bearing the vast majority of the cost of the tariffs. And it is Americans who make the actual tariff payments.\\n\\nThe history of tariffs on China\\n\\n\"We`re taking in a lot of money. We haven`t taken any money from China ever, and it`s coming in now by the billions.\" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania\\n\\nFacts First: Again, Americans are paying for these tariffs. Regardless, it`s not true that the US Treasury has never received any money from tariffs on Chinese products. The US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries; FactCheck.org : Again, Americans are paying for these tariffs. Regardless, it`s not true that the US Treasury has never received any money from tariffs on Chinese products. The US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries; FactCheck.org reported that the US generated an \"average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the US International Trade Commission DataWeb.\"\\n\\nThe US also \"takes\" in money from Chinese purchases of US products -- more than $300 billion during Trump`s presidency alone.\\n\\nChina`s wealth\\n\\nTrump said China is \"down about $32 trillion\" over the last three years. -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\\n\\nFacts First: Trump was vague about what he meant, but there is no apparent basis for this figure. (In late November, Trump used different figures: \"$24 trillion,\" \"probably $25 trillion,\" and \"probably ... $30 or $35 trillion.\") Experts on the Chinese economy rejected previous Trump claims of a $10 trillion drop in Chinese wealth.\\n\\nGeorge Magnus, a research associate at Oxford University`s China Centre, said, \"I`m afraid I have no idea to what the President is referring and I dare say neither does he.\"\\n\\nThe US record at the World Trade Organization\\n\\n\"We never used to win before me, because, before me, the United States was a sucker for all of these different organizations. And now they realize -- the World Trade Organization realizes that my attitude on them: If they don`t treat us fairly, well, I`ll tell you someday what will happen. And we`ve been winning a lot of cases at the World Trade Organization. We virtually -- very rarely did we ever win a case. They took advantage of the United States.\" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\\n\\nFacts First: The US has long won cases at the World Trade Organization, and there is no evidence that WTO adjudicators have suddenly changed their behavior. Trump`s own Council of Economic Advisers : The US has long won cases at the World Trade Organization, and there is no evidence that WTO adjudicators have suddenly changed their behavior. Trump`s own Council of Economic Advisers said in a report in February 2018 that the US had won 86% of the cases it has brought since 1995. The global average was 84%.\\n\\nA Bloomberg Law review in March found that the US success rate in cases it brings to the WTO had increased very slightly since Trump took office, from 84.8% in 2016 to 85.4%.\\n\\nThe trade deficit with the European Union\\n\\n\"But we have a very unfair trade situation, where the US loses a lot of money for many, many years with the European Union -- billions and billions of dollars. I mean, to be specific, over $150 billion a year.\" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron\\n\\nFacts First: The trade deficit with the European Union was $114.6 billion in 2018, $101.2 billion in 2017, $92.5 billion in 2016. The deficit was $169.6 billion in 2018 if you only count trade in goods and ignore trade in services. But Trump, as usual, failed to specify that he was using this more limited measure.\\n\\nWe`ll ignore Trump`s characterization of trade deficits as losses, which is sharply disputed by many economists.\\n\\nImmigration\\n\\nDemocrats and borders\\n\\nTrump said three times that Democrats support \"open borders.\"\\n\\nFacts First: Even 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.\\n\\nMexican soldiers and the border\\n\\n\"...and Mexico is now giving us 27,000 soldiers at our border...\" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania\\n\\n\"Right now, we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our southern border telling people, `You can`t come in.`\" -- December 7 speech to the Israeli American Council National Summit\\n\\nFacts First: Mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular.\\n\\nCNN reported on November 2: \"Nearly 15,000 troops are deployed to Mexico`s northern border, where they`ve set up 20 checkpoints, Mexican Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval said last week at a press briefing on the country`s security strategy. At the southern border, 12,000 troops are deployed and have set up 21 checkpoints.\"\\n\\nActing US Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan has offered similar numbers, telling reporters in September that 10,000 of approximately 25,000 troops were on Mexico`s southern border.\\n\\nForeign and military affairs\\n\\nObama and the ISIS caliphate\\n\\n\"We`ve defeated the ISIS caliphate. Nobody thought we could do that so quickly. I did it very quickly. When I came in, it was virtually 100%. And I knocked it down to 0. I knocked it down to 0.\" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\\n\\n\"Al-Baghdadi created a caliphate bigger than the state of Ohio, think of that, that`s a big caliphate. And we now have taken 100% of the caliphate...and with Obama you did nothing, you did nothing, but get your ass kicked.\" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania\\n\\nFacts First: Trump is free to criticize Obama`s conduct of the war against ISIS, but it`s not true that \"nothing\" was accomplished under Obama in the fight to eradicate the terror group`s self-proclaimed \"caliphate,\" nor that ISIS possessed \"virtually 100%\" of this territory when Trump took office.\\n\\nNicholas Heras, Middle East Security Fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said that \"at the time of his inauguration in January 2017, the Obama administration had regained close to 50% of ISIS`s would-be Caliphate.\"\\n\\nEstimates of pre-Trump progress against ISIS vary -- some put the Obama-era progress closer to a third of former ISIS territory -- but Heras` estimate roughly squares with news reports from the end of the Obama era. Regardless of the precise figure, there is no doubt that ISIS had lost a substantial portion of its land holdings under Obama.\\n\\nThe cost of moving the embassy to Jerusalem\\n\\n\"So, two years ago, I recognized the true capital of Israel, and we opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And we got it built. They were thinking anywhere, for one billion to two billion dollars. I did it for $350,000.\" -- December 11 speech at Hanukkah reception and signing of executive order against anti-Semitism\\n\\nFour days pror, Trump told a lengthy version of this story, saying he was initially told the Jerusalem embassy project would cost \"$2 billion\" or \"up to $2 billion\" but managed to get it built for \"less than 500,000 bucks.\" -- December 7 speech to the Israeli American Council National Summit\\n\\nFacts First: The State Department : The State Department awarded a $21.2 million contract in 2018 for a company to design and build \"compound security upgrades\" related to Trump`s decision to turn the existing facility into an embassy. While the initial modification that allowed the building to open as an embassy cost just under $400,000, that was not the final total.\\n\\nThe size of the Iran deal\\n\\nIn three separate claims, Trump said President Barack Obama \"gave $150 billion\" to Iran, \"paid $150 billion\" to Iran, and gave Iran a \"$150 Billion gift.\"\\n\\nFacts First: Trump was wrong about the \"$150 billion\": the sum in question was Iranian money frozen in foreign financial institutions because of sanctions, not US government money -- and experts say the total was significantly lower than $150 billion. You can read a fuller fact check : Trump was wrong about the \"$150 billion\": the sum in question was Iranian money frozen in foreign financial institutions because of sanctions, not US government money -- and experts say the total was significantly lower than $150 billion. You can read a fuller fact check here\\n\\nThe Obama administration did send Iran $1.7 billion to settle a decades-old dispute over a purchase of US military goods Iran made before its government was overthrown in the Islamic Revolution of 1979.\\n\\nMilitary spending by NATO members\\n\\n\"It was going down for close to 20 years. If you look at a chart, it was like a rollercoaster down, nothing up. And that was going on for a long time. You wouldn`t have had a NATO if you kept going that way.\" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\\n\\n\"So NATO, which was really heading in the wrong direction three years ago — it was heading down. If you look at a graph, it was to a point where I don`t think they could have gone on much longer.\" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron\\n\\nFacts First: Military spending by NATO members had increased for two years prior to Trump`s presidency. According to the latest NATO : Military spending by NATO members had increased for two years prior to Trump`s presidency. According to the latest NATO figures released in November, spending increased by 1.7% in 2015 and 3.0% in 2016.\\n\\nUS military spending, part 1\\n\\n\"Now we have spent two and a half trillion dollars on rebuilding our military. And we have a military that`s the most advanced, the most powerful, by far, of any in the world. Two and a half trillion dollars. We rebuilt our military.\" -- December 7 speech to the Israeli American Council National Summit\\n\\nFacts First: Trump was exaggerating. Defense spending for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was $2.05 trillion, and that includes more than three-and-a-half months of Obama`s tenure, since the 2017 fiscal year began in October 2016.\\n\\nTodd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he thinks Trump must have been including military funding for the 2020 fiscal year to get to the \"$2.5 trillion\" figure -- but the 2020 fiscal year just started on October 1, and Harrison noted that the defense appropriation has not yet been approved by Congress.\\n\\nUS military spending, part 2\\n\\nTrump said on two occasions that the US is spending \"4 to 4.3%\" of Gross Domestic Product on defense.\\n\\nFacts First: The US is expected to spend 3.42% of GDP on defense in 2019, according to NATO estimates issued in November -- similar to its 2018 spending level.\\n\\nAmmunition\\n\\nTrump said that when he took office, the US military \"was in trouble.\" He added, \"We didn`t have ammunition.\" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\\n\\nFacts First: According to military leaders, there was a shortfall in certain kinds of munitions, particularly precision-guided bombs, late in the Obama presidency and early in the Trump presidency. But the claim that \"we didn`t have ammunition\" is a significant exaggeration. Military leaders did not say that they had completely run out of any kind of bomb, let alone ammunition in general.\\n\\nYou can read a full fact check of Trump`s claims about munitions levels here\\n\\nISIS prisoners\\n\\n\"But many are from France, many are from Germany, many are from UK. They`re mostly from Europe.\" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron\\n\\nFacts First: French President Emmanuel Macron correctly told Trump that it is not true that \"most\" ISIS prisoners in Syria are from Europe.\\n\\nJames Jeffrey, Trump`s special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, said on August 1 that roughly 8,000 of about 10,000 terrorist fighters being held in northeastern Syria are Iraqi or Syrian nationals; there were \"about 2,000 ISIS foreign fighters\" from all other countries. Trump himself tweeted in February to ask that European countries take back \"over 800\" ISIS fighters captured in Syria.\\n\\nMacron fact-checked Trump to his face, saying: \"The very large number of fighters you have on the ground are ISIS fighters coming from Syria, from Iraq, and the region. It is true that you have foreign fighters coming from Europe, but this is a tiny minority of the overall problem we have in the region.\"\\n\\nAn agreement with South Korea\\n\\nTrump claimed that South Korea had agreed to an increase of \"almost $500 million\" in its payments to the US for the cost of having US troops based in the country. He said that this increase brought the South Korean payment \"close to\" $1 billion from a previous $500 million. -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\\n\\nFacts First: Trump was correct about the new total but exaggerated the size of the increase, as he has repeatedly on this subject in the past. As the New York Times : Trump was correct about the new total but exaggerated the size of the increase, as he has repeatedly on this subject in the past. As the New York Times reported in February when debunking an earlier version of Trump`s \"$500 million\" claim: \"Under the one-year deal, this year South Korea will pay 1.04 trillion won, or $925 million, an increase of $70 million from last year`s $855 million.\"\\n\\nTrump is now trying to get South Korea to agree to a much larger increase for 2020. American and South Korean officials said this week that they have so far failed to reach an agreement and that the next round of talks is scheduled for January.\\n\\nTrump and Brexit\\n\\n\"You know that I was a fan of Brexit. I called it the day before. I was opening up Turnberry the day before Brexit...And they asked me whether or not Brexit would happen. I said `yes,` and everybody smiled and they laughed. And I said, `Yes, it`s going to happen, in my opinion.` It was just my opinion. The next day, they had the election, and I was right.\" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\\n\\nFacts First: Trump was not even at Turnberry the day before the vote; he visited the club and spoke to the press : Trump was not even at Turnberry the day before the vote; he visited the club and spoke to the press the day after the vote. Trump did predict Brexit in March 2016; the day before the vote three months later, however, he made no prediction. He said in an interview that day with Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business, \"I don`t think anybody should listen to me,\" because \"I haven`t really focused on it very much,\" but that his \"inclination\" would be that Britain should vote to leave the European Union.\\n\\nIran`s economy\\n\\n\"Their GDP went down 25% this year. Twenty-five. Nobody has ever even heard of that.\" -- December 7 speech to the Israeli American Council National Summit\\n\\nFacts First: Trump was exaggerating. While Iran`s economy is shrinking, the Statistical Center of Iran : Trump was exaggerating. While Iran`s economy is shrinking, the Statistical Center of Iran reported that the country`s GDP fell by 4.9% in the year 2018-2019.\\n\\nExperts say there is no apparent basis for Trump`s \"25%\" figure even though Iran`s official economic data is less reliable than official data in the US.\\n\\n\"It`s still not iron-clad stuff, but if the situation was anywhere near 25% decline then the official stats would at least be in the teens. This is also why folks cross-check these numbers with independent and global institutional data (such as IMF`s). My suspicion is that it`s closer to 13-15% decrease, which still puts it a good 10% points below Trump`s claim,\" Hussein Banai, an assistant professor who studies Iran at Indiana University`s School of International Studies, said in an email in October, when Trump made another version of this claim.\\n\\nThe International Monetary Fund has forecast a 9.5% contraction in Iran`s economy this year -- down from an earlier estimate of a 6% contraction, but still not 20% or 25%. The World Bank has forecast an 8.7% contraction in the 2019-2020 period.\\n\\nEnvironment\\n\\nWind power\\n\\n\"Those windmills, wah wah wah [windmill sound]. `Darling, I want to watch television tonight and there`s no damn wind. What do I do? I want to watch the election results, darling, there`s no wind, the damn wind just isn`t blowing like it used to because of global warming, I think. I think it`s global warming.`\" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania\\n\\nFacts First: Using wind power as part of a mix of power sources does not cause power outages even when the wind isn`t blowing, as the federal Department of Energy : Using wind power as part of a mix of power sources does not cause power outages even when the wind isn`t blowing, as the federal Department of Energy explains on its website. \"Studies have shown that the grid can accommodate large penetrations of variable renewable power without sacrificing reliability, and without the need for `backup` generation,\" the Department of Energy says.\\n\\nAir quality\\n\\n\"Look, I want clean air. I want clean water, crystal clean. I want -- and that`s what we have at a record level. Our air and our water are cleaner now than it`s ever been, OK, with all that we`re doing.\" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania\\n\\nFacts First: By several measures, US air was : By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it has been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency data.\\n\\nAdditionally, there were more \"unhealthy air days\" for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016 -- 799 days across the 35 American cities surveyed by the EPA, up from 702. Though there were significantly more \"unhealthy air days\" in Obama`s first term than there have been in Trump`s, the lowest amount of unhealthy air days -- 598 -- occurred in 2014 under Obama.\\n\\nJudicial vacancies\\n\\n\"We will soon have 182 federal judges, including court of appeals, nobody can believe it. All because Barack Obama gave us 142 empty seats.\" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania\\n\\nFacts First: Trump exaggerated. According to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments, there were 103 vacancies on district and appeals courts on Jan. 1, 2017, just before Trump took office, plus a vacancy on the Supreme Court.\\n\\nPre-existing conditions\\n\\n\"We will strongly protect patients with pre-existing conditions.\" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania\\n\\nFacts First: We usually don`t fact check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward : We usually don`t fact check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare`s protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void. He has not issued a plan to reinstate the law`s protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds.\\n\\nThe government`s land holdings\\n\\n\"Secretary Dave Bernhardt. Where is David? David is the largest landlord in the country by a factor of about 50. By a -- when we think we big landlords, he controls half of the United States, actually. Secretary of the Interior.\" -- December 11 speech at Hanukkah reception\\n\\nFacts First: We know Trump was speaking informally here, but \"half of the United States\" is a significant exaggeration. The Congressional Research Service : We know Trump was speaking informally here, but \"half of the United States\" is a significant exaggeration. The Congressional Research Service reported in 2017 : \"The federal government owns roughly 640 million acres, about 28% of the 2.27 billion acres of land in the United States.\" The land is managed by the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture.\\n\\nRoad approval times\\n\\n\"...to build a road can take 22 years to get approvals...And we`ve got that process down to four and a half years. It`s going to be -- I think it`s going to be two years. We`re going to try and get it down to almost one year.\" -- December 6 remarks at roundtable on small business and red tape\\n\\nFacts First: There is no evidence Trump has reduced the approval time for federal road approvals.\\n\\nThis version of Trump`s claim was more accurate than his usual one. Though he has repeatedly claimed, inaccurately, that he has gotten the approval time down to two years or less, he acknowledged here that the approval time is significantly longer than that.\\n\\nNonetheless, he was wrong when he claimed that the current approval time represents a Trump-era improvement. According to the Federal Highway Administration`s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) page , the department`s median environmental impact statement completion time was 47 months in 2018, up from 46 months in 2017 and 44 months in 2016. (There is no apparent basis for Trump`s \"22 years\" claim; he might be referring to some particular exceptional case.)\\n\\nWe asked the Department of Transportation if we are missing something, but we did not receive a response. We will update this item if we receive any new information.\\n\\nApproval among Republicans\\n\\nTrump claimed five times to have a \"95%\" approval rating among Republicans. On four of those occasions, he said this was \"a record.\" He twice claimed that Ronald Reagan is in second place at \"87.\"\\n\\nFacts First: Trump`s approval rating among Republicans is very high, regularly in the 80s and sometimes creeping into the 90s, but it has not been 95% in any recent major poll we could find.\\n\\nTrump was at 81% approval with Republicans in an Ipsos/Reuters poll conducted December 9-10, 85% in a Fox News poll conducted December 8-11, 91% in a NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll conducted December 9-11, 92% in a Quinnipiac University poll conducted December 4-9.

Check out its observations, analysis and other thoughts on the first few days of the 2019-20 season.\\n\\nNew era kicks off with big win\\n\\nRanked No. 4 in the Preseason Top 20, Camden came into the season as the top-ranked public school in the state. If Friday’s season-opening win is any indication, the Panthers should be in for an exciting ride. They topped previously unbeaten Simon Gratz - a Philadelphia Public League power - by 20 points and left an overflow crowd wanting more. Freshman guard D.J. Wagner, the son of New Jersey’s all-time leading scorer Dajuan Wagner, scored 15 points in his debut, while Kentucky-bound senior Lance Ware added 12 points and 13 rebounds. Throw in 13 points from Jerome Brewer and TaQuan Woodley’s 16 rebounds and five blocks and the Panthers certainly have a pretty solid foundation.\\n\\nWelcome to the BCSL\\n\\nA team that will compete in the Freedom Division, Doane Academy kicked off its first season in the Burlington County League with a pair of victories. The Spartans earned their first division win with a 67-60 decision over Pemberton behind 17 points from Alex Moore. Shawn Congelton then scored 16 points in a 64-56 win over Delsea in the Jimmy V Showcase at Cherokee.\\n\\nKeep an eye on this Lion\\n\\nIf a 1,000-point scorer can fly under the radar, Tazir Cantey falls into that category. A junior guard at Lindenwold, Cantey reached the milestone last year and is off to an explosive start. He scored a game-high 28 points to go along with five rebounds, three assists an four steals in a season-opening win over Paulsboro on Friday. Cantey then dropped 43 with five steals against STEM Civics on Saturday. Cantey raised his total to 1,079 career points.\\n\\nThweatt puts Crusaders on his shoulders\\n\\nA second team All-State pick last season, Taj Thweatt hasn`t skipped a beat. The 6-7 Wildwood Catholic senior led No. 3 Wildwood Catholic to victories over Holy Spirit and Notre Dame. The West Virginia commit had 20 points, nine rebounds and nine blocks against Holy Spirit and followed that up with 27 points, seven boards and three blocks against the Irish. The Crusaders have high expectations this winter and will need this kind of production out of Thweatt on a consistent basis to complete for a Non-Public B state title.\\n\\nStill pouring in the points\\n\\nDefending South Jersey Group 1 champion Clayton may have graduated a significant number of players, but it appears the ‘Tornado’ offensive attack is back. After scoring 100-plus points in eight games last season and averaging nearly 88 points, the Clippers dropped 109 Friday in a 26-point win over Pennsville. Isaiah Harold had 21 points, while Kevin Pretlow and TiJere Jackson added 16 apiece to lead the way. While it remains far from the way most teams attack the basket, it works for Clayton.\\n\\nBergen County is going to be fun\\n\\nThere are some big-time teams in Bergen County this season and the opening weekend showed us that the race for the Bergen County Jamboree title is going to be fun.\\n\\nAt the top of it all is No. 7 Bergen Catholic, which took care of business with an 89-43 win over Paterson East Side and an 81-70 win over St. Thomas Aquinas. Will Richardson has looked incredible in the early-going, while fellow sophomore guard Julian Brown has emerged as a go-to-option and Notre Dame-forward Matt Zona handles the play down low.\\n\\nNo. 13 Don Bosco Prep opened the year with a 72-64 win over Newburgh Free Academy (N.Y.) before falling to No. 5 Elizabeth, 78-68. Senior guard Myles Ruth is playing like a man possessed and has the ability to take over games.\\n\\nSt. Joseph (Mont.) is off to a nice start with a 73-36 win over River Dell and a 71-67 win over Ramsey. St. Joe`s has some nice depth - especially at the guard position with Daniel Lans, Dyree Rogers and Nazir Williams leading the way. Ansley Almonor is St. Joe`s big.\\n\\nHackensack is led by guard Seth Sharif-Brown and he is an absolute beast. He opened the season with 30 points in an 83-66 win over Passaic Tech. This team reached the North 1, Group 4 final last year and has its sights set on championships.\\n\\nFair Lawn is off to a very nice start. It won a nail-bitter over Northern Highlands, 57-56, with Or Sundjyvsky posting a double-double with 18 points and 10 boards. John Burek added 12 points and blocked Northern Highlands’ buzzer-beater attempt, while Jami Reyes had 14 points. In less dramatic fashion it improved to 2-0 with a 58-51 win over Secaucus. Burek led the way with 18 points and 10 rebounds.\\n\\nThere was some hype surrounding Ramsey after it reached the North 1, Group 2 final and although it dropped its first two games, this team still has the talent to be a player in Bergen County.\\n\\nManasquan has the right to believe it is the Shore’s top team\\n\\nNo. 17 Manasquan loves making statements on opening weekend. Last year it took down Union Catholic, 78-74. This year it took down No. 6 Newark East Side, 74-67. The win was its third straight to start the year after taking down Raritan, 65-30, and Brick Memorial, 72-39. Senior forward Alex Galvan has been lights out with 65 points through the first three games, while freshman guard Ben Roy has 51.\\n\\nManasquan reached the Shore Conference Tournament final last year and fell to a loaded Ranney squad. With Scottie Lewis and Bryan Antoine graduated, Manasquan has its sights set on winning its first Shore Conference Tournament title in 63 years and repeating as Central Jersey, Group 2 champs.\\n\\nDon’t sleep on DePaul in Passaic County\\n\\nDePaul may have finished under .500 the last two seasons, but made a serious statement on opening weekend by taking down a good Ramsey team, 67-59. Anthony Corbo led the way with 23 points, while John O’Reilly, Nick Bayuelo and Irving Wakins finished in double-figures as well. It has a nice test Monday as it takes on Clifton, which reached the Passaic County Tournament final last season. Clifton opened the year with a 61-44 win over Lakeland behind 12 points from Paul Dupree.\\n\\nSomerset’s top squads get the job done\\n\\nComing into the season, No. 8 Gill St. Bernard’s, No. 9 Rutgers Prep and Watchung Hills were the favorites in Somerset County. After the opening weekend, those teams have lived up to the hype. Gill St. Bernard’s took down Hillsborough, 92-28, and took down Marist, 78-67. Freshman forward Mackenzie Mgbako has made an immediate impact with 37 points in his first two games, while Princeton-bound senior Zach Martini has 39 points and 30 boards. Sophomore point guard Denver Anglin runs the offense and has 36 points. Rutgers Prep is hoping that this year will be the one where it gets on top of Somerset County. It is 2-0 with a 90-47 win over North Hunterdon and a 78-65 win over Seton Hall Prep. Nico Galette is the senior leader of this team, while star juniors Trey Patterson and Noah Harris are full of talent. Watchung Hills defeated Bridgewater-Raritan, 73-46, and West Caldwell Tech, 101-54 behind a steady dose of Michael Bressler, Trevor Bokach, Jack Dwyer and Chad Martini.\\n\\nNorth Hunterdon plays til the final buzzer\\n\\nDon’t count out North Hunterdon. Ever. Seriously. The Lions scored five points in 1.1 seconds to defeat Nottingham, 61-59. Down 59-56, Wes Reinagel hit a fall-away trey to tie the game at 59-59. Then, Nottingham was whistled for having six players on the court resulted in a technical foul and two North Hunterdon free throws. Reinagel headed to the charity stripe because of course he did and as expected hit both free throws to secure a wild victory for the Lions. The victory was a great way to bounce back from a tough season-opening loss to Rutgers Prep.\\n\\nUnion’s (San) born winner\\n\\nThis past fall season, Union’s Andrew Sanborn was known for his passing. To such an extent, that the senior quarterback was named New Jersey Offensive Player of the Year by NJ.com after throwing for 2,903 yards and 27 touchdowns to lead his Farmers to a 12-1 record and to their first North 2, Group 5 sectional title in 26 years. So far this winter, Sanborn is making a name for himself (or, rather, keeping it relevant) for how much he is helping Union by not passing. More specifically, for his long-range shooting at the end of feeds from a teammate. Sanborn came off the bench in Union’s season opener against Plainfield last Thursday to knock down two big 3-pointers and close with 10 points in a thrilling 73-72 double-overtime victory. Two days later, he pumped in a career-best seven shots from behind the stripe and a team-high 23 points to fuel a 67-54 win over Columbia. Sanborn, who is yet uncommitted for football, passed for 7,166 yards for fourth all-time in the Garden State.\\n\\nWelcome to your career\\n\\nCamden’s D.J. Wagner is the most publicized freshman in New Jersey this season, but hardly the only newcomer who made a splash for his scoring ability and surprising poise in his initial varsity starts. Wagner, the son and grandson of Camden legends Dajuan and Milt, respectively, was impressive in his debut, scoring 15 points in his debut Friday to help the Panthers defeat Simon Gratz (Pa.), 72-52. He had plenty of company. Among the standouts from the Class of 2023 were:\\n\\nMackenzie Mgbako, Gill St. Bernard’s. The 6-6 forward scored 18 points Friday in a 92-28 win over Hillsborough, and collected 19 points, 10 rebounds Sunday in a 78-67 win over St. Thomas Aquinas at the HoopGrouo Tip-Off Showcase in Elizabeth.\\n\\nMalachi Johnson, Union. The 5-10 guard scored 12 points Thursday in a 73-72 overtime win over Plainfield at the St. Jude Classic in Union, and contributed eight two days later in a 67-54 win against Columbia.\\n\\nJaylin Hodge, Linden. The 5-8 guard scored eight points and had five assists Thursday in a 51-40 victory over University at the St. Jude Classic in Union, and he had three points the next day in a 64-35 victory over North Star Academy.\\n\\nAkil Watson, Don Bosco Prep. The 6-6 forward dropped in nine points and had two assists in the Ironmen’s 78-68 loss to No. 5 Elizabeth Sunday at the HoopGroup Tip-Off Showcase in Elizabeth.\\n\\nElijah Gertrude, Hudson Catholic. The forward scored eight points and took down two rebounds Sunday to help the 11th-ranked Hawks defeat Christian Brothers, 69-33, at the HoopGroup Tip-Off Showcase at Elizabeth.\\n\\nJabbour’s painful goodbye\\n\\nIf a throbbing ankle that he rolled only two days earlier could not stop Jerry Jabbour from playing his final game in the Mendham High gym, imagine how difficult it must have been for a defender to discourage him? The Mendham resident did everything he could to work the ankle back into functioning order and then took some legs away himself by scoring 18 points and adding six rebounds and six assists to steer Delbarton to a 65-51 victory. Jabbour’s home is in Mendham, and his second home as a youngster was that very Mendham gym, where his father, also Jerry, served as an assistant under legendary Minutemen coach Jim Baglin. He shot countless baskets on that floor, though not in front of the packed house in attendance for that season-opener Friday.\\n\\nBrick City connection\\n\\nThe Newark border is just about a mile from the Patrick School in Hillside, but it must have felt a whole lot closer for the Celtics on Saturday at the Elizabeth Dunn Center. In Pat’s game against Hun at the HoopGroup Tip-Off Classic, three Newark-bred stars took ownership of the proceedings to help the No. 2 Celtics to a 70-49 victory to improve to 2-0. Samson Johnson (not a Newark resident) led the Celtics with 22 points, but then the Brick City’s own Zarique Nutter and Noah Farrakhan scored 18 points apiece and Kirk Parsons had eight points and two assists. Nutter transferred in from St. Benedict’s in Newark after starting his career at Central. Farrakhan was at IMG Academy in Florida, and Parsons transferred from West Side.\\n\\nSetting the bar high from jump\\n\\nAmir Williams did not score Linden’s first basket of the season (that was Yasin Willock), but he did knock down the next four to both provide his Tigers with a six-point lead against Newark University on Thursday and set some pretty lofty standards for himself the rest of the way. The 6-4 senior dropped in eight of his game-high 21 points and tore down five of his 13 rebounds in that opening quarter of Linden’s 51-40 victory Thursday at the St. Jude Classic in Union. The next day, Williams was sharp on all points with 21 points, nine rebounds, three assists and five steals to fuel a 64-35 win against North Star Academy of Newark.\\n\\nRichard Greco, Mike Kinney and Kevin Minnick cover boys basketball for NJ Advance Media.

      "Document(text='CLEVELAND, Ohio — The coffee flowed with the college basketball memories for Phil Bova, from officiating basketball games for $3 to facing Bobby Knight’s legendary temper tantrum. Bova’s era as a college official has long past, but for hoops insiders, he has put together an informative and humorous book. “Throwing Back the Chair,” co-authored by Nino Frostino, offers a pinstriped insight to the game few can match.\\n\\nA Cleveland native, Bova was a 30-year basketball official, primarily in the Big Ten, but also throughout the country. His officiating career spanned from 1974 through 2004, what some might call the golden age of college basketball. Bova never officiated a Final Four, but does not bow his head when he says it.\\n\\nBova, 73 and a resident of Westlake, officiated in 20 straight NCAA Tournaments.\\n\\n“I’m proud of that,’’ he said. “Never a Final Four, but did get to the Elite Eight. But that doesn’t define a good referee. It’s one thing to get to this level. It’s another thing to stay there.”\\n\\nSprinkled throughout the 191-page paperback are quotes and taunts most any official is bound to hear over the course of a career. The quotes are lead-ins to its 12 chapters.\\n\\n“Hey ref, you might want to check your phone. You’ve missed quite a few calls.” — Penn State fan.\\n\\nBova was tracking to be a NBA official, but said the strain on him and his young family at that time was more than he wanted to handle. Besides, Bova was quite happy where he was. That made the game-day madness well worth the trouble. With rare exceptions, even now, most college basketball officials actually have a day job.\\n\\nBova was an vocational administrator at Buckeye High in Medina County. So he had to travel to games after the school day ended, and be back for class by 8 a.m. the next morning. It wasn’t always easy, as Bova explains in the book. But it was worth it.\\n\\n“I was on the court with some of the greatest players and some of the greatest coaches in the history of college basketball,’’ he said. “Looking back, what a privilege and an honor.”\\n\\nIn the book, he lists the greatest Big Ten players he saw. While he primarily worked the Big Ten, where he blew the whistle with players such as Isiah Thomas, Magic Johnson and Clark Kellogg on the court, he also had games with Michael Jordan. He had to ply his trade under the peering eyes of iconic coaches, among them: Knight, Gene Keady, Jud Heathcoate, Dean Smith, Digger Phelps, Mike Krzyzewski, Bob Huggins, Rick Pitino, John Chaney, Steve Fisher, John Calipari Jim Boeheim and Tom Izzo.\\n\\nYet he also ranks local favorites, including former Cleveland State coach Ray Dieringer and Akron coach Keith Dambrot among his list of favorite coaches. There is one regional icon he is not too fond of, current West Virginia head coach Huggins, who apparently also is not too fond of him - but, well, just read the book.\\n\\nThe Plain Dealer Referee Phil Bova. (Plain Dealer file)\\n\\n“I just got a text from Revlon … they thank you for the MAKEUP call.” - Umass fan Bova lists his favorite Big Ten players, his favorite arenas, the top 15 games he worked and some of his favorite officials. His three-team All-Big Ten unit is led by Glen Robinson (Purdue) with Calbert Chaney (Indiana), Kellogg (OSU), Thomas (IU) and Johnson (Michigan). That era not also conjures up memorable games, including the night famously Knight tossed a chair onto the court in disgust over a whistle. Bova didn’t make the offending call, but he was on the crew and in the heat of the action. That story is in the book, and is a spinoff for the title, but there is so much more inside these pages. Bova does not list his personal top ‘technical fouls called - or near misses’ yet judging from the book former Ohio State coach Gary Williams, Chaney, Izzo and a few others would clearly make the cut.\\n\\nHardcore basketball fans will enjoy an anecdote about the first face-off between former assistants Bruce Pearl and Jimmy Collins. This was a true “bad blood” game with a back story of recruiting battles and NCAA violations that haunted both men, then and now. That game is No. 9 on Bova’s Top 15 list. He also recalls “bad blood” games such as Temple (Chaney) vs. UMass (Calipari) and UNLV (Jerry Tarkanian) against Utah (Rick Majerus) matchup. Bova did games with Michigan’s Fab 5 as well as Notre Dame.\\n\\nNortheast Ohio basketball fans will find one of the first Mid-American Conference Tournament games played in Cleveland, Miami vs. Ball State (2000), is No. 13 on the list.\\n\\nSo how did a young, married, aspiring baseball player wind up officiating basketball? That’s a story itself. Bova was a football, baseball and basketball captain at West High. A few years later, while trying to ignite a professional minor-league baseball career, Bova attended a charity basketball game featuring some Browns players. When one of the officials got hurt, he raised his hand to help finish out the game. “I’m an athlete. I know hoops,” he recalls in the book.\\n\\nCleveland Plain Dealer Phil Bova in 1985.\\n\\n“I wanted to have a career in sports when I was young, but I had to give up that idea. I’m only 6-feet tall so I couldn’t play basketball. I’m only 190-pounds so I couldn’t play football. And I had 20/20 vision so I couldn’t be a referee.” — Jay Leno.\\n\\nWithin a year, Bova, gave up working the betting windows at Northfield and Thistledown race tracks for $27 a day and began a grass-roots officiating career — seven CYO games a day for $3 a game. The rungs of the officiating ladder from there were $25 JV games at Cleveland State and the Mid-American Conference along with select high school games and NCAA Division III college games in the area.\\n\\nBy 1975, he was doing varsity games for the MAC and Cleveland State, then the call came in 1976 to work Big Ten game. His first game was Indiana-Purdue (with Indiana coming off a national championship) working with Final Four official Charley Fouty on what was then a two-man crew. The veteran had succinct words of advice for Bova right before tipoff: “Don’t (blank) it up.”\\n\\nWhile Bova missed what is now a lucrative, $2,000-$3,000 per game payday for power five conference officials, what he did make, along with his regular job, was enough to put his three children through college.\\n\\nThe challenge now, with nine grandchildren nearly all participating in some form of sports, is that Bova’s reputation and notoriety kind of puts him in a box when he attends their events. “I have to sit at their games like a Buddhist monk,’’ he said.\\n\\n“I hope your seeing eye dog bites you.” — Wisconsin fan.\\n\\n(“Throwing Back the Chair,” $16.99, Amazon.com) From Bobby Knight’s chair to Bob Huggins’ glare, referee Phil Bova shares choice stories in college basketball memoir 12-2019', doc_id='c00966bf-65fe-4f16-b717-b19c857ca6a8', embedding=None, doc_hash='539dae0051514477d7fca468bfc2f42d121c457c7b966a568d60e0cc417b9a67', extra_info=None)\n",

      "Document(text='USA TODAY\\n\\nJetpacks, disintegrator rays, nuclear energy, Mars.\\n\\nDecades ago, academics, futurists and government agencies cast their predictions of what would happen by the year 2020. Will submarines reach historic depths? Who will lead future nations, and which ones will be global superpowers? Will Planet Earth even exist as we known it?\\n\\n\"I shall not be surprised if on my 92nd birthday I am able to go for a ride in an antigravity car,\" mathematician and scientist D.G. Brennan wrote in 1968.\\n\\nSome, like Brennan, were overly optimistic. Others were spot-on. Here`s what happened, what didn`t and what was just plain crazy.\\n\\n1. Life expectancy will rise to over 100\\n\\nFuturist Ray Kurzweil predicted in 1999 that human life expectancy would rise to \"over one hundred\" by 2019.\\n\\n\"Computerized health monitors built into watches, jewelry, and clothing which diagnose both acute and chronic health conditions are widely used. In addition to diagnosis, these monitors provide a range of remedial recommendations and interventions,\" he wrote in \"The Age of Spiritual Machines.\"\\n\\nNope: While Kurzweil may have accurately predicted health-related gadgets (such as fitness watches, BioScarves and EKG apps for your smartphone), he jumped the gun on life expectancy.\\n\\nIn 2019, the average life expectancy of the global population was 72.6 years, according to the United Nations. That average is slightly higher in the U.S., at 78.6 years in 2017, according to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\\n\\nWhile life expectancy in many industrialized nations continues to inch up, it has been going in the opposite direction in America. The U.N. predicts the average global life expectancy to rise to 77.1 years by 2050.\\n\\nLife expectancy:What countries have the longest?\\n\\n2. Computers will be invisible\\n\\nKurzweil had several other prophecies for the year 2019, including invisible computers.\\n\\n\"Computers are now largely invisible. They are embedded everywhere — in walls, tables, chairs, desks, clothing jewelry and bodies. People routinely use three-dimensional displays built into their glasses or contact lenses. ... This display technology projects images directly into the human retina.\"\\n\\nKeyboards and cables would also become rare, he said.\\n\\nIt`s true — Computers are embedded everywhere these days. We have smart homes, smart tables, smart chairs, smart desks and more. While we may not project images directly into our retinas, Google Glass comes pretty close.\\n\\n(Per Kurzweil`s previous prediction, scientists are also developing smart contact lenses capable of monitoring the physiological information of the eye and tear fluid and could provide \"real-time, noninvasive medical diagnostics.\" Several groups are testing smart lenses that would measure glucose levels in the tears of people with diabetes.)\\n\\n3. Books will be dead\\n\\n\"Papers books and documents are rarely used or accessed. Most twentieth-century paper documents of interest have been scanned and are available through the wireless network,\" Kurzweil predicted.\\n\\nWrong. While the net revenue of the U.S. book publishing industry has been decreasing since 2014, the industry still sold 675 million print books and brought in nearly $26 billion in 2018, according to the Association of American Publishers annual report.\\n\\n4. Your every move will be tracked\\n\\nKurzweil predicted that privacy would be a huge political and social issue and that \"each individual’s practically every move (will be) stored in a database somewhere.\"\\n\\nTrue, most say. Your TV watches you. Your smartphone follows you. Your web browser traces your digital trail. In an era when some populations worldwide are living under 24/7 high-tech surveillance, most U.S. adults now say they do not think it is possible to go through daily life without having data collected about them by companies or the government, according to a new survey of U.S. adults by Pew Research Center.\\n\\nMore than 80% say that the potential risks they face because of data collection by companies outweigh the benefits.\\n\\n5. World`s population will reach 8 billion\\n\\nIn 1994, the International Food Policy Research Institute projected the world population would increase by 2.5 billion to reach 8 billion by 2020. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and the continent of Africa would add another 1.5 billion people, the institute predicted.\\n\\nClose, but no cigar: The world`s population is 7.7 billion, according to a June report from the United Nations. The report expects the population to grow by another 2 billion in the next 30 years. Around 2027, India is projected to overtake China as the world’s most populous country, the report says.\\n\\n6. China will be the world`s largest economy\\n\\nSpeaking of China... in a 1997 article \"The Long Boom,\" futurists Peter Schwartz and Peter Leyden thought China would be on top:\\n\\n\"By 2020, the Chinese economy has grown to be the largest in the world. Though the U.S. economy is more technologically sophisticated, and its population more affluent, China and the United States are basically on a par,\" they said.\\n\\nClose. In 2019, China was still trailing the U.S. as the world`s second largest economy, by nominal GDP. Recent reports, however, predict that China and India will overtake the U.S. by 2030.\\n\\n7. We`ll have self-driving cars\\n\\n\"Self driving cars are being experimented with in the late 1990s, with implementation on majors highways feasible during the first decade of the twenty-first century,\" Kurzweil wrote.\\n\\nKind of. Dozens of companies — including Tesla, Google spinoff Waymo and ridesharing giants Uber and Lyft — are still testing self-driving vehicles in select locations, such as Boston, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Columbus, Ohio.\\n\\nWidespread use of a truly autonomous vehicle, however, is not yet here: Experts say it might still be decades before we see a car that can drive anywhere it pleases.\\n\\nSelf-driving shuttle:Why a Rhode Island police officer pulled it over\\n\\nIn April, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company would have fully self-driving cars ready by the end of the year and a \"robotaxi\" version — one that can ferry passengers without anyone behind the wheel — ready for the streets next year. Tesla owners can already \"summon\" their cars, which can drive themselves from parking spots to the curb, where the owner is standing.\\n\\nWhat about flying cars? Porsche and Boeing are partnering up to create \"premium urban air mobility vehicles,\" and Uber plans to launch a flying taxi service in 2023.\\n\\n(Planes, meanwhile, are landing themselves.)\\n\\n8. It will be normal to retire at 70\\n\\nIn his 1994 book \"The World in 2020,\" British commentator and editor Hamish McRae foresaw retirement ages reaching 67 to 70.\\n\\n\"The main motive for this in Europe is cost to the state. Governments feel that if retirement ages are not raised, the burden of paying pensions will be so high that working people will not be prepared to pay the tax levels necessary to fund them,\" McRae wrote.\\n\\nNo: In the U.S., the average retirement age in 2016 was 65 for men and 63 for women, according to the Center for Retirement Research. That number has stayed relatively stagnant for men over the last few decades but has increased for women. For full Social Security benefits, however, the age is slowly climbing and depends on the year that you were born.\\n\\nSome European countries set 67 as retirement age, the earliest age when citizens can start withdrawing pensions, and several plan to raise the age in the next few years, according to the Finnish Center for Pensions. For many Europeans, the topic is a matter of fierce debate.\\n\\n9. Americans will vote electronically from home\\n\\nAs the millennial generation comes of age, they`ll be able to vote electronically from home, Schwartz and Leyden predicted — possibly as soon as the presidential election of 2008.\\n\\nNot yet. Amid fears of foreign interference in U.S. elections, lawmakers aren`t about to let you vote in next year`s presidential election on your iPhone. Proponents of online voting, however, say it could improve turnout and prevent voter suppression at polling stations.\\n\\nStart-ups are developing solutions for online voting, such as the Voatz mobile voting platform, which has used biometric/facial recognition in at least four public election pilots in the U.S. Last year, West Virginia began using Voatz for absentee voting for military personnel stationed overseas. In one Utah county, citizens with a disability were able to vote electronically on their smartphones in a 2019 municipal general election.\\n\\n10. China will be on a path to democracy\\n\\nSchwartz and Leyden predicted that, despite taking \"draconian measures\" to avoid an internal crisis in the first decade of the new century, China \"is generally acknowledged to be on a path toward more democratic politics — though not in the image of the West.\"\\n\\nNot really. In 2019, China faces increasing scrutiny for human rights abuses against pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong and against nearly 1 million Uighurs, a predominantly Muslim population who have been arbitrarily detained and imprisoned in \"re-education\" camps in China`s Xinjiang region.\\n\\n11. We`ll have `personal companions`\\n\\nIn his 1999 book \"Business @ the Speed of Thought,\" Bill Gates predicted personal devices that \"connect and sync all your devices in a smart way, whether they are at home or in the office, and allow them to exchange data.\"\\n\\n\"The device will check your email or notifications, and present the information that you need. When you go to the store, you can tell it what recipes you want to prepare, and it will generate a list of ingredients that you need to pick up. It will inform all the devices that you use of your purchases and schedule, allowing them to automatically adjust to what you`re doing,\" Gates wrote.\\n\\nHey, Alexa: Add milk to my shopping list.\\n\\nWhile Alexa isn`t sorting through your emails (that we know of) and your smart thermostat isn`t tracking your purchases, Gates isn`t far off. Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa and an array of smart tech in the Internet of Things now readily exchange data with your other devices and respond to commands.\\n\\n12. Cars will be able to go months without refueling\\n\\nSchwartz and Leyden also predicted that, by 2010, \"hydrogen would be processed in refinery-like plants and loaded onto cars that can go thousands of miles — and many months — before refueling.\"\\n\\nBy 2020, they said, almost all new cars would be hybrid vehicles, mostly using hydrogen power.\\n\\nWhat`s the future of the auto industry? Hydrogen cars appear to give way to electric\\n\\nNot yet. Toyota and Honda are leading the hydrogen-powered car market, but it`s an uphill battle against competitors peddling battery-powered electric vehicles. In 2018, 2,300 hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles were sold in the U.S. — less than 1% of the number of electric cars sold, according to InsideEVs, which covers electric vehicle news.\\n\\nIn other green transportation news: Last year, European railway manufacturer Alstom launched the world’s first hydrogen fuel cell train, and, next year, London is expected to roll out double-decker hydrogen-powered buses.\\n\\n13. Heart disease, depression will be world`s top diseases\\n\\nIn 1996, the Harvard School of Public Health and the World Health Organization predicted that, by 2020, the world`s top two causes of the global burden of disease — a measurement of the number of healthy life years lost due to sickness, disability or early death — were expected to be ischemic (coronary) heart disease and unipolar major (clinical) depression.\\n\\nAt the time, the leading causes were lower respiratory infections (like pnuemonia) and diarrheal diseases, the study said.\\n\\nClose: In 2017, the most recent year that the data set was published, coronary heart disease was the second leading cause of the global burden of disease, not depression.\\n\\nThe five leading causes were neonatal disorders, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, lower respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\\n\\n14. Global surface temperature will increase\\n\\n(Climate predictions tend to have a longer range, but here`s a snapshot of where 2020 stands.)\\n\\nA 1995 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted that the average global surface temperature could increase by about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) by 2100 (or anywhere between an increase of 1 degrees Celsius to 3.5 degrees Celsius, depending on global emissions).\\n\\nThe report also predicted that sea level could increase by about 20 inches by the same year.\\n\\nOn track: With 80 years still to go, both predictions appear possible. The global average temperature has risen a tad more than a 1 degree Fahrenheit (about 0.6 degrees Celsius) since the mid-90s, according to NOAA. And since 1992, the global sea level has risen a total of more than 3 inches, according to NOAA.\\n\\n15. Humans will step foot on Mars\\n\\nA 1996 report by the Space Studies Board of the National Research Council said that NASA would launch \"possible human exploratory missions to the moon and Mars within the next quarter century,\" predicting that humans would land on Mars by 2018.\\n\\nSchwartz and Leyden envision a similar scenario: \"In 2020, humans arrive on Mars ... The four astronauts touch down and beam their images back to the 11 billion people sharing in the moment. The expedition is a joint effort supported by virtually all nations on the planet, the culmination of a decade and a half of intense focus on a common goal.\"\\n\\nNot quite: While we haven`t set foot on Mars, we`ve landed eight unmanned spacecraft on the planet`s surface.\\n\\n16. Boris Johnson would lead Brexit\\n\\nIn 1997, British news organization The Independent forecast that in 2020 Boris Johnson would become a member of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom, a decision-making body composed of the Prime Minister and a team of hand-picked Members of Parliament.\\n\\nAt the time, Johnson, 32, was known as an outspoken editor and columnist but had not held public office. \"Not shy in clashing with party lines, Boris would `renegotiate EU membership so Britain stands to Europe as Canada, not Texas, stands to the USA,`\" the journalists wrote.\\n\\nPretty close: Have you heard of Brexit? Johnson became Prime Minister in July 2019. He first served in the Cabinet starting in 2016 as foreign secretary under Theresa May. In December, Johnson led his Conservative Party to victory in a national election on the promise to \"get Brexit done.\"\\n\\n17. Antigravity belts will revolutionize warfare\\n\\nImagine a world where battles are fought just a few feet above the ground, as soldiers hover in mid-air. In 1968, mathematician and scientist D.G. Brennan predicted that antigravity belts would \"revolutionize the tactics of land warfare,\" writing that \"even if the antigravity mechanism did not itself provide horizontal propulsion, relatively modest sources of thrust could easily be provided.\"\\n\\nHe also suspected that, by 2018, humans would have antigravity cars and jetpacks capable of operating for 30 minutes.\\n\\nNo. (Unless you`re Luke Skywalker or Buzz Lightyear.)\\n\\n18. Nuclear will replace natural gas\\n\\nIn 1968, Stanford University professor Charles Scarlott predicted that nuclear breeder reactors would make up the majority of U.S. energy production by 2018 as natural gas fades.\\n\\n\"Energy from water power, solar radiation, the wind, tides, or earth heat will not figure large in the totals. Power from nuclear power plants should be available in large amounts at low cost,\" Scarlott wrote.\\n\\nWrong: In 2018, fossil fuels — petroleum, natural gas and coal — accounted for about 79% of total U.S. primary energy production in 2018, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. About 12% was from renewable energy sources, and about 9% was from nuclear electric power.\\n\\n19. Americans will work 26 hours a week\\n\\nIn 1968, it was thought that, by 2020, Americans would work 1,370 hours a year (or 26 hours a week), instead of the 1,940 hours (37 hours a week) that was average at the time, according to physicist Herman Kahn and futurist Anthony J. Weiner.\\n\\nUnlikely: While we are working less than we were in 1968, the average American worked nearly 1,800 hours in 2018 (35 hours a week), according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\\n\\n20. Nationalism will wane\\n\\nIn the same 1968 text, Ithiel de Sola Pool, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, predicted that better communication, easier translation and greater understanding of the nature of human motivations would make it easier for people to connect across ethnic and national lines.\\n\\n\"By the year 2018 nationalism should be a waning force in the world. The increasing openness about feelings and identifications may help men to overcome some of the more destructive and hostile motivations that underlie nationalism,\" he wrote.\\n\\nThe opposite is true. Fueled by backlash against immigration, globalization and the political establishment, populist nationalism was a driving force behind Brexit, the election of Donald Trump and the rise of right-wing politicians in France, Austria, Italy, Hungary and Poland, among other countries, academics say.\\n\\n\"Everywhere one looks, in fact, one sees nationalism at work in today’s world,\" Stephen Walt, a professor of international relations at Harvard University, wrote in Foreign Policy Magazine. 20 predictions for 2020: Here`s what people thought would happen by this year 12-2019', doc_id='868fc006-833f-43e1-8981-1a83a7d8c976', embedding=None, doc_hash='60c729b2f9802a74ae39cee9ca9ca93a3662dc0f47c6ef52e3f767e20a645030', extra_info=None)\n",

The Cullman Times reported that sixth-grader Denna Chivers has been helping the Cullman County Animal Shelter for three years by holding yard sales and giving the proceeds to the operation. The girl’s mother, BethAnn, said she raised $400 one year and $1,400 the next. She raised $3,000 this year, which was used to purchase some equipment. The shelter decided to use the remainder of the money to offer free adoptions to people looking for a pet. A shelter worker said the offer started Thursday. Denna said she loves all animals, but dogs and cats are her favorite.\\n\\nAlaska\\n\\nSitka: The Sitka Planning Commission got its first look Wednesday at how city code could be amended to make room for tiny houses, specifically those on chassis allowing the structures to be moved. At Wednesday’s meeting, the commission voted 3-2 to direct special projects manager Scott Brylinsky to continue developing proposals on changing parts of the general code to define tiny houses and tiny houses on chassis. The idea is to allow them in mobile home parks and manufactured home parks. Brylinksy was hired to work on an action plan for tiny homes, among other projects. The informal action plan was proposed by the Sitka Assembly last year. The plan directed the Planning Commission review zoning codes to see which ones could be changed to enable tiny homes as a potential affordable housing option. Acting Chairman Darrell Windsor said he would like the full commission present before making recommendations for changes related to tiny homes.\\n\\nArizona\\n\\nFlagstaff: Democratic U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona has introduced a bill that would ban new mining claims around the Grand Canyon. The Obama administration put about 1,562 square miles outside the boundaries of Grand Canyon National Park off-limits to new hard rock mining claims until 2032. The bill would make that permanent. Environmentalists and Native American tribes applauded Sinema’s introduction of the bill Thursday. They say mining in the Grand Canyon region, particularly for uranium, could contaminate a water source that serves millions of people. The bill isn’t expected to have an easy ride in the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans who have opposed the effort. The House passed a similar bill introduced by Arizona Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva earlier this year. Meanwhile, the mining industry has been pushing President Donald Trump to boost demand for domestic supplies of uranium, tax breaks and other financial incentives.\\n\\nArkansas\\n\\nLittle Rock: The Republican president pro tem of Arkansas’ Senate said Friday he won’t seek another term leading that chamber next year. Sen. Jim Hendren said he won’t run for another two-year term as the chamber’s president when senators meet at the end of next year’s fiscal session to select a new leader. Hendren’s term as Senate president runs through the end of 2020. Hendren said he’s still seeking re-election to the Senate next year. Hendren said he plans to decide after next year’s session whether to seek the Republican nomination for governor in 2022. Hendren said he didn’t want to serve as the chamber’s leader and run a statewide campaign if he does jump in the governor’s race. Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is Hendren’s uncle, is barred by term limits from seeking re-election in 2022. Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin has said he’s seeking the GOP nomination. Other potential GOP candidates for governor include former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders and Attorney General Leslie Rutledge.\\n\\nCalifornia\\n\\nLos Angeles: At least three unoccupied passenger buses caught fire Saturday night at Los Angeles International Airport, the Los Angeles Fire Department said. Shortly after 9 p.m., LAX Airport said on its Twitter account that “there is a significant fire emergency at the LAX-it lot. Emergency responders are on scene. More to come. No immediate reports of injuries.” KTLA and the CBS station in Los Angeles tweeted photos of the fire spewing smoke. At about 10 p.m., the airport said that the fire had been put out, and there were no injuries. The lot reopened, and ride-share services resumed.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nFort Collins:Michelle Lindsay, a Zumba instructor and registered dental hygienist from Fort Collins, became the country’s first avalanche death of the season on Dec. 8. On her first run down the South Diamond Peak face, Lindsay was engulfed by an avalanche in a narrow gully. Despite efforts to save the 29-year-old, she died from asphyxiation after being buried. The Colorado Avalanche Information Center released its full report on the avalanche Thursday, which included details from interviews with Lindsay’s companion, a male who was not named in the report. According to the report, Lindsay was 150 feet below her companion, about 11,200 feet in elevation, when she triggered an avalanche midslope. Her partner watched the avalanche unfold around her but noted that it did not look very deep, maybe only up to the top of her boots. He continued to see Lindsay in the avalanche, but the visibility was poor and she disappeared into the white cloud.\\n\\nConnecticut\\n\\nHartford: The Department of Consumer Protection reminded residents that package stores must be closed on Christmas Day and on New Years Day, under state law. Connecticut law also requires bars to be closed by 3 a.m. on the morning of New Years Day. Consumer Protection Commissioner Michelle Seagull said her office encourages those who choose to drink alcohol “to make responsible decisions.” She reminded the public they must be over age 21 to make alcohol purchases. Connecticut lawmakers this year passed legislation updating the state’s liquor laws, in hopes of helping the state’s growing craft brewery industry. One change, which has taken effect, allows breweries to sell more beer to customers for consumption off-premises. The prior law limited craft breweries to selling only up to nine liters to a single individual within one day.\\n\\nDelaware\\n\\nDover: The state has confirmed that 26 school-aged children have been infected through a salmonella outbreak that is potentially linked to recalled fruit. The state’s health department said in a statement Friday that evidence indicated that the fruit potentially came from a company in New Jersey. The firm had recently recalled some fruit mix, as well as cut honeydew, cut cantaloupe and cut pineapple. The fruit was distributed in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Delaware. It was sold for use in institutional food service establishments such as schools. The children who were infected with the bacteria in Delaware were in New Castle County. Officials said there is no ongoing risk to any students. The children affected are between the ages of 4 and 17. Salmonella are a group of bacteria that can cause gastrointestinal illness and fever. Most people develop diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps. But some people might need to be hospitalized.\\n\\nDistrict of Columbia\\n\\nWashington:The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture has extended its hours from 10 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. starting Dec. 26, and patrons won`t need a pass to enter, WUSA-TV reported. The no-pass entry will go through Dec. 30. After those dates, the museum will resume back to its regular schedule. Groups of 10 or more are still required to get passes to enter the museum. Since opening three years ago, more than 6 million people have visited the museum, the largest cultural destination showcasing the African American story and its impact on American and world history.\\n\\nFlorida\\n\\nYeehaw Junction: A semi-truck plowed into a historic inn south of Orlando early Sunday, causing major damage but no apparent injuries. The truck ran through the wall of the Desert Inn and a portion of the building collapsed around it. Lisa Mason, who ran the inn before it closed last year, confirmed the crash but said she didn’t know any details. She said she doesn’t believe anyone was injured. The Florida Highway Patrol did not immediately return a call and email seeking comment. The inn is the centerpiece of Yeehaw Junction, a tiny respite off Florida’s Turnpike between South Florida and Orlando. According to a 2013 article in the Orlando Sentinel, the Desert Inn dates to 1889 when it was a barroom and brothel for cowboys and lumberjacks, and the look of the place hadn’t evolved much since. Through the years, the Desert Inn has been a trading post, gas station and dance hall. Until its closure, it served as a motel, restaurant and convenience store. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.\\n\\nGeorgia\\n\\nAtlanta: A family got a real hoot from its Christmas tree: More than a week after they bought it, they discovered an owl nestled among its branches. Katie McBride Newman said Friday that she and her daughter spotted the bird on Dec. 12. They had bought the 10-foot-tall tree from a Home Depot, brought it back to their Atlanta-area home and decorated it with lights and, coincidentally, owl ornaments. “It was surreal, but we weren’t really freaked out about it,” McBride Newman said. “We’re really outdoorsy people. We love the wilderness.” The family opened windows and doors near the tree hoping the owl would fly away, but it didn’t. So the family called a nonprofit nature center for help. The Chattahoochee Nature Center caught the bird and helped the family release it. McBride Newman said she believed the bird had been in the tree since they bought it but was hidden.\\n\\nHawaii\\n\\nHonolulu: An illegal fishing net discovered in Oahu’s Kaneohe Bay was so large that a forklift was needed to move it, state officials said. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources said the net was found by two boaters last week, Hawaii Public Radio reported Thursday. The boaters discovered the net after their craft became entangled. They said that after they pulled the net out of the bay, the apparent owners chased them to retrieve the equipment. The boaters returned to the harbor and their pursuers fled, they said. State officials were not able to immediately measure the net, but the boaters said their measurement found 500 yards of netting. Rules adopted in 2007 to govern the use of gill nets left floating on top of the water to trap fish can be no longer than 125 feet. Lay nets are banned within 3 miles of the Oahu shoreline and in specific areas of the island including Kaneohe Bay, where the net was found, officials said. Maui has banned lay nets, which a land and natural resources department official said is the most regulated form of gill net fishing. A $5,000 fine can be levied for a first offense of catching threatened or endangered wildlife in the nets, with additional fines for each threatened or endangered wildlife taken, harmed or killed. A first-offense fine for illegal lay net fishing can cost up to $1,000.\\n\\nIdaho\\n\\nBoise: The Idaho Public Utilities Commission has rejected a proposal that would have slashed the incentive for the power generated from solar panels. The proposal to change net metering would have changed how much Idaho Power customers with solar panels can be reimbursed for the energy they harness that goes back into the power grid. The proposed settlement between Idaho Power, the Sierra Club, the city of Boise, Idaho Clean Energy Association, Idaho Irrigation Pumpers Association and others would have cut the rate from almost 10 cents per kilowatt produced to somewhere around 4.4 cents per kilowatt hour over the course of about 10 years. The PUC on Friday rejected that settlement, saying the public wasn’t adequately notified about the significant changes. The commission instead directed Idaho Power to conduct a cost-benefit analysis on the solar panel program while also voting to permanently grandfather in the 4,000 existing Idaho Power customers so that their rates will not change.\\n\\nIllinois\\n\\nChicago: Metra is buying hundreds of new rail cars and wants passengers to weigh in on what amenities they would like to see in them, from cup holders to power outlets, tray tables or wifi. The suburban Chicago commuter rail agency expects to spend almost $1.2billion over the next five years to buy and rehabilitate rail cars and locomotives. The funding comes from a capital bill Illinois lawmakers approved this year. Metra issued a request for proposals earlier this year for at least 200 new rail cars, with options for up to 300 more. Manufacturers were encouraged to submit proposals that increase capacity and optimize amenities. Now the agency is asking commuters to complete a survey about which amenities are most important to them. Options include tray tables and power, as well as head rests, interior and exterior information signs or lights that can be dimmed. Metra said it can’t guarantee everything commuters want will be incorporated into the new cars but said it will try to get the most amenities possible. The survey is available at metrarail.com through mid-January.\\n\\nIndiana\\n\\nTerre Haute: Unusually large flocks of seagulls have descended on a western Indiana city, bringing the sounds of the beach to a local reservoir where the birds began gathering in late November. Residents near Hulman Lake on Terre Haute’s east side have seen hundreds of ring-billed seagulls in the skies over the reservoir since the birds began flocking around Thanksgiving. Peter Scott, a retired Indiana State University ecology professor who directs an annual Christmas Bird Count around Terre Haute, estimated that between 400 and 1,000 of the birds have congregated at the lake.He said ring-billed gulls aren’t uncommon in Indiana, but they prefer to winter around larger bodies of water like southern Indiana’s Lake Monroe. Scott said their appearance in large numbers at Hulman Lake is rare. Scott said the birds are most likely feeding on small fish in the lake. The Cornell University Lab of Ornithology described ring-billed seagulls as sociable creatures that feed together at coastal beaches but often head inland during winter to forage at golf courses, farm fields and garbage dumps.\\n\\nIowa\\n\\nDuncombe: After more than a century, a barn near this northern Iowa community is getting a new home and a new look. Matt and Libby Mitchell acquired the barn built in 1915 and watched nervously Thursday as it was moved about a mile over fields to a new location. Matt Mitchell prepared a path over fields by driving a blade over the land, smoothing out ruts. He now plans to restore the barn. Mitchell has restored two other barns and knows he’s in for a long process. Still, he said the structure is worth the restoration work. The Iowa Barn Foundation covered about half the moving expenses. The job was handled by Vote House Moving of Bradgate, in Humboldt County. Once the barn is restored to its original appearance, Libby Mitchell said she has plans for it. “We’ll put some cows and pigs in it,” she said.\\n\\nKansas\\n\\nLawrence: The Lawrence library is joining a growing number of libraries that are dropping fines for overdue books. The library’s board voted unanimously Tuesday to make the change, The Lawrence Journal-World reported. Library patrons still will be charged for lost or damaged items. Patrons also would be blocked from checking out additional books and materials once an item became two weeks overdue, but the return of the overdue item would immediately restore access. Among those expressing concerns was Michael Austin, who said the change could result in people keeping books for long periods of time, ultimately reducing access to those materials for everyone else. But Brad Allen, the library’s executive director, said eliminating overdue fines is in line with the stance of the American Library Association that library policies should not disadvantage low-income people. The ALA officially came out against charging fines earlier this year, citing concerns that fines create barriers to library materials and services.\\n\\nKentucky\\n\\nLouisville: Deeply affected by a Courier Journal series in August on child abuse and neglect, members of Christ Church United Methodist are collecting and displaying prayers on behalf of abused children in Kentucky, which has the highest rate of child maltreatment in the nation. Church member Bill Cooper, a retired lawyer who is active in social justice work at Christ Church, is working with others at the church, including Shelah Woodruff, director of outreach, and the Rev. Leanne Hadley, the children’s and youth minister. They came up with an idea: collect 1,000 prayers during the four-week Advent season before Christmas and display them. Christ Church also created a display that is open to the public with information about child abuse, how to report it, Kentucky’s sobering statistics and suggestions on how people can volunteer or get involved in efforts to fight the problem. People who view the display are invited to fill out a prayer card.\\n\\nLouisiana\\n\\nBaton Rouge: Louisiana’s recreational red snapper season likely will continue through 11:59 p.m. on New Year’s Eve. Surveys indicate that 98% of the state’s quota had been caught as of Dec. 8, with about 16,100 pounds remaining, according to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. If that’s all that is caught before Dec. 31, the season will end earlier. Louisiana’s recreational season opened May 24 and was weekends-only for most of the year. But in early November, Wildlife and Fisheries Secretary Jack Montoucet expanded it to all week, starting on Thanksgiving. At the time, 27,582 pounds were left in the quota. The popular sport and table fish is still recovering from nearly disastrous overfishing. Red snapper has been a hot issue in the Gulf of Mexico, with seasons getting shorter and shorter as fish got larger and more numerous. In 2017, the Trump administration extended a three-day season to 42 days, even though regulators said the extension could add up to six years to the time required for red snapper stocks to recover. Regulators agreed in 2018 on a two-year pilot program under which each state sets dates for and keeps tabs on the recreational red snapper catch in federal waters off its coast. If approved by the U.S. commerce secretary, this would become official policy. In April, the group that manages Gulf of Mexico fishing in federal waters said states can continue managing anglers’ catch of red snapper after this year.\\n\\nMaine\\n\\nOrono: A mapping and engineering company is donating about a million aerial images of New England to a University of Maine library. The university said Raymond H. Fogler Library has received 3,000 rolls of film from the James W. Sewall Co. of Old Town. The collection is made up of original aerial photography of Maine and other New England states, and it spans more than six decades. The archive of images will allow researchers and members of the public access to “a vast collection that details changes to Maine’s landscape over the past century,” the university said in a statement. The collection will be especially useful for forestry research, said Daniel Hayes, assistant professor in the university’s School of Forestry Resources.\\n\\nMaryland\\n\\nAnnapolis: Salvation Army leaders said a donor recently dropped thousands of dollars worth of jewelry in a red kettle. Capt. Ryan Vincent is commander of the Salvation Army in Annapolis. He told the Capital Gazette that everyone was shocked to find out the ring and two bracelets were real. One of the bracelets, a yellow-gold piece by Tiffany & Co., has been sold for $1,500. A gemologist will soon examine the ring and second bracelet that features diamonds and rubies to determine their value. Pearl Eldridge is the ringer who collected the donation. She called the donor a “quiet spirit,” and said the woman told her the pieces were sentimental but had been laying around. Other unusual donations have been reported in Salvation Army kettles across the country, including a gold bar in Kentucky and a more than century-old gold coin in North Carolina. Vincent said the Salvation Army has a policy for dealing with jewelry donations. Pieces found in a kettle are kept for 30 days, but if someone acknowledges leaving a piece with the bell ringer, it’s immediately considered donated. If big donations are found to be stolen, the charitable organization arranges them to be returned.\\n\\nMassachusetts\\n\\nBoston: The state is using money it received from a nationwide settlement with Volkswagen to help electrify the state’s transportation sector and reduce air pollution. The state has designated a total of $7.5million toward 98 projects, including the purchase of electric cars, diesel-hybrid electric waste collection trucks, liquid-propane-gas school buses, cleaner-diesel trucks and ferry engines, and a marine shore-power installation. The money for the grant program comes from a settlement with Volkswagen over the company’s illegal tampering of vehicle emission control equipment. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said the money will be used on projects to put 32 heavy-duty vehicles, eight medium-duty vehicles, 17 buses, two marine engines, 35 pieces of airport ground-support equipment and three pieces of cargo-handling equipment into operation and install one new marine shore-power site. The new equipment will replace pre-2010 diesel counterparts. Baker said three-quarters of the funding will go towards areas where there are high populations of minority, low-income, or low English proficiency residents\\n\\nMichigan\\n\\nLansing:A nonprofit distributed nearly 50 bicycles to children after a dozen volunteers spent several weeks cleaning and repairing them. The Lansing Bike Co-op staged the giveaway last weekend, offering the 49 used bikes to anyone on a first-come, first-served basis, the Lansing State Journal reported. There were no rules or requirements, but the co-op teaches cyclists, many financially struggling, how to keep their rides in good working order. Every bike came with a red, green or blue helmet. Among those claiming bikes was Ciera Bonilla, who secured two for her daughter, 6, and son, 3. She said her son has autism and she hopes his first two-wheeler will help him gain independence and physical skills. Co-op President Aaron Fields said he believes a bike is “an essential part of childhood.” The organization launched in 2015 and is raising money to pay the mortgage for the east-side property it bought in July.\\n\\nMinnesota\\n\\nProsper: Authorities said four people were injured, including one critically, in separate vehicle crashes involving horses on the same southeastern Minnesota highway. The crashes happened within an hour of each other Friday night on state highway 44, the Star Tribune reported. The State Patrol said a 12-year-old boy was critically injured when a car struck a horse and buggy carrying the boy and five others. It happened about 7 p.m. just outside Prosper, on the Iowa border. The boy was airlifted to a hospital in La Crosse, Wisconsin. Two others on the buggy suffered nonlife-threatening injuries. The driver of the car and his passenger were not injured. About 45 minutes later, a pickup truck hit a horse that was loose on the highway about 13 miles east of the first crash. The driver was taken to a hospital with noncritical injuries.\\n\\nMississippi\\n\\nColumbus: Teachers and staff at two northern Mississippi schools are receiving more than $370,000 in bonuses because their schools have improved under a state grading system. Columbus Municipal School District trustees voted in 2018 to adopt a Teacher Incentive Pay Plan to provide bonuses for faculty and staff members of improving and high-performing schools. The plan also includes bonus incentives for math and science teachers. The first checks arrived this month, and the Commercial Dispatch reported that a celebration was held Tuesday at an elementary school. Superintendent Cherie Labat credited the trustees for showing employees how much their achievements are valued. Stokes-Beard Elementary School and Columbus High School improved this year in accountability ratings from the state Department of Education. Faculty and staff members at the schools received a combined $181,354. The district’s 54 math and science teachers, 15 of whom are new hires, received $189,000 total. The Columbus district has maintained a D overall rating for the last two years. However, during the 2018-19 school year, Columbus High improved from a C to a B, and Stokes-Beard jumped from an F to a B.\\n\\nMissouri\\n\\nSt. Louis: Mayor Lyda Krewson is pulling the plug on an airport privatization effort because of a lack of support. Krewson said Friday she’s determined that there is “very little support for moving forward with a private operator” for St. Louis Lambert International Airport after listening to members of the public, business leaders and other political leaders. She said she is sending a letter to members of the Airport Advisory Working Group, asking that her representative, Linda Martinez, not support or vote to move forward with issuing a request for proposals, St. Louis Public Radio reported. Krewson has been in favor of exploring the process to see if it could result in a good deal for the city – canceling nearly $600million in airport debt and bringing in up to $2billion in net proceeds.\\n\\nMontana\\n\\nBillings: A natural gas leak caused an explosion at an apartment complex that sent two people to the hospital with severe burns, officials said Saturday. Billings Deputy Fire Marshal Jeff McCullough said the explosion at about 9:45p.m. Friday caused an estimated $250,000 in damages. The Battleship Apartments building was cleared of residents, and an adult male and adult female were taken to a hospital. Residents of the building told The Billings Gazette that the blast sent glass from a door shooting into the road and that it sounded like a tree hitting the roof. Montana-Dakota Utilities was called to turn off gas to the building.\\n\\nNebraska\\n\\nColumbus: Consumers who get electricity from the Loup Public Power District in eastern Nebraska won’t see an increase in their electricity rates this year. The Columbus-based power district said the rates will hold steady for the third year in a row because of the district’s financial performance this year and its budget and expenses, according to the Columbus Telegram. District CEO Neal Suess said the company’s internal costs generally determine whether customer rates get raised. Jim Donoghue, chairman of Loup’s Rates Committee, said in a statement that company representatives have been working to make sure that customer’s rates do not increase next year.\\n\\nNevada\\n\\nReno:Washoe County Roads has begun posting a snowplow monitoring system featuring an interactive map showing where trucks are operating in Incline Village and Crystal Bay in nearly real-time. County Community Services Operations chief Eric Crump said one of the most frequent questions officials get from the public is, “Where are the plows?” He said that by equipping trucks with automated vehicle locator technology, people can see for themselves which areas have recently been plowed. Officials said they hope they will be able to expand the “Where’s My Plow?” interactive map to other snowy high-elevation areas near Reno.\\n\\nNew Hampshire\\n\\nPlaistow: Firefighters said they got to work when a woman arrived in the lobby and announced she was having a baby. Firefighters told WMUR-TV that the woman was put on a stretcher, and the fire station training room became a delivery room Friday night. Seven minutes later, a baby boy was born. Firefighter and EMT Derek Travers said the episode was his first “field birth” in 23 years. “It meant a lot to me to see the beginning of life, not the end of life that we see a lot of times,” he said. Firefighters said they’re happy everything went smoothly. An ambulance transported mother and baby to a hospital.\\n\\nNew Jersey\\n\\nTrenton: Two Florida companies failed to comply with subpoenas to turn over records to New Jersey regarding the sale of outlawed large-capacity gun magazines, Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said Friday in a suit against the firms. Elite Aluminum, of Holly Hill, Florida, and 22Mods4All, of Longwood, Florida, refused to turn over documents showing information about large-capacity magazine sales into the state, Grewal said in a statement. Messages seeking comment have been left with both companies. New Jersey sent both firms cease-and-desist letters earlier this year after they sold the outlawed magazines to an undercover state investigator, said Grewal, a Democrat. The firms complied, but then failed to hand over more information about earlier sales despite subpoenas. New Jersey law caps magazines at 10 rounds, down from 15 before 2018, when Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed legislation limiting magazine size. The suits were filed in state Superior Court in Essex County.\\n\\nNew Mexico\\n\\nAlbuquerque: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico said people shouldn’t expect any major administrative changes with White Sands National Monument becoming the state’s first national park since 1930. But he cited a study that said the park could see an increase of 100,000 visitors annually with the change in status. Heinrich told the Albuquerque Journal that such an increase would be a boom for the local economies with an additional $7.5million in tourist spending in the area a year. He said national park status will open White Sands to more exposure from national travel and outdoors publications. Heinrich has also introduced legislation that would designate Bandelier National Monument in northern New Mexico a national park.\\n\\nNew York\\n\\nNew York: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday he will push legislation banning gender-based price disparities for similar goods and services. Cuomo, a Democrat, cited research that indicated women often end up with a larger bill for items like toys, clothing and personal care products. The proposal, rolled out as part of Cuomo’s State of the State agenda, would require certain service providers to post price lists for standard services. Businesses that don’t comply could be hit with civil penalties. A 2015 study by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs found that 42% of the products targeted at women were more expensive than those marketed to men. Products aimed at women cost an average of 7% more than similar items for men and personal care products for women were priced 13% higher than men’s products, according to the study. In 2016, New York banned taxes on menstrual products and last year enacted laws mandating equal pay and barring companies from asking about salary history.\\n\\nNorth Carolina\\n\\nManteo: Cold weather is causing a problem for some sea turtles off the North Carolina coast, and an aquarium has taken in dozens of them for treatment. WVEC-TV reported that 96 turtles were taken to the North Carolina Aquarium on Roanoke Island after a drop in temperatures on Thursday and Friday. More are expected to be treated there in the coming days. Dropping water temperatures can cause cold-stunning, a condition similar to hypothermia that makes turtles unable to swim properly. The recovery process involves gradually warming the turtles up over a few days. According to the TV station, the center will be closed to the public beginning Sunday to accommodate all the turtles.\\n\\nNorth Dakota\\n\\nBismarck: The Bismarck Park Board has voted to create a formal process for renaming city parks after some residents pushed to have a park stripped of its name because of the “historical trauma” they said is associated with its namesake, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer. Rather than immediately change the name of Custer Park, the board voted Thursday to develop guidelines for renaming parks. A draft of those guidelines will be considered by the board in February. A member of the Three Affiliated Tribes, M. Angel Moniz, told the board that to some, Custer is a reminder of violence and genocide, according to the Bismarck Tribune. Custer served during the Civil War and fought against Native Americans on the Great Plains in the 1860s and 1870s. In 1868, he launched an attack on Chief Black Kettle’s Southern Cheyenne Village near present-day Cheyenne, Oklahoma, in which Native American women were raped and killed in an assault known as the Washita Massacre. Custer spent several years stationed at Fort Abraham Lincoln in Mandan before his death.\\n\\nOhio\\n\\nAthens: The Ohio school district where Heisman Trophy winner Joe Burrow played football has named its high school stadium in his honor. The Athens City School District Board of Education in southeast Ohio posted a proclamation about the naming this week on Facebook. The proclamation details Burrow’s accomplishments as quarterback for Athens High School, where he was named Ohio Mr. Football in 2014, and at Louisiana State University, where he’s the quarterback for the undefeated Tigers. LSU faces the University of Oklahoma on Dec. 28 in the semifinals of the College Football Playoff. Burrow endeared himself to many by discussing the poverty endemic to the Appalachian region where he grew up in his Heisman acceptance speech. His comments prompted a campaign that has raised more than $400,000 for the Athens County Food Bank, the Athens High School Boosters, the county’s Children’s Services agency and other nonprofits. The proclamation directs Athens school district officials to plan a ceremony in Burrow’s honor.\\n\\nOklahoma\\n\\nTulsa: Officials said a privately owned cemetery is blocking efforts to find the remains of black Tulsa residents killed nearly 100 years ago in a race riot. But an attorney for the cemetery said his client submitted a proposal in November that would allow the city to search under certain conditions. Mayor G.T. Bynum has insisted that the city would do everything it could to find possible mass graves with victims of one of the worst race-related massacres in U.S. history. The 1921 violence left as many as 300 dead on Tulsa’s Black Wall Street. Bynum said the city has been unable to investigate whether Rolling Oaks Cemetery in south Tulsa contains unmarked graves, the Tulsa World reported. However, Timothy Studebaker, a Tulsa attorney representing Rolling Oaks, said the cemetery is not opposed to scanning its grounds. Bynum said the city will look at possible legal action if an agreement can’t be reached.\\n\\nOregon\\n\\nSalem: Oregon is renowned for its craft beer and increasingly for its high-grade marijuana, but the state is keeping the two apart – for now. In a new ruling, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, which regulates alcoholic products and recreational marijuana, said beer and other alcoholic drinks as of Jan. 1 cannot contain either THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis, or CBD, the nonpsychoactive part that is said to relieve stress and pain. Mark Pettinger, a spokesman for the agency, cited concerns raised by the U.S. Food and Drug of potential liver damage from CBD, also known as cannabidiol. One prominent CBD-infused beer, Two Flowers IPA, was popular in The EastBurn, a Portland pub, according to Michael Fritz, one of the owners. The website of the brewery that made the beer, Coalition Brewing of Portland, said the CBD’s “bitter grassiness augments the hop bitterness, while the citrusy terpenes in the CBD mirror the aromatics and hop flavors.” Coalition Brewing recently went out of business. Pettinger said he didn’t know of any other Oregon brewery that makes CBD-infused beer.\\n\\nPennsylvania\\n\\nHarrisburg: Businesses that manufacture frames that can be built into working firearms sued Pennsylvania’s attorney general on Friday, five days after he issued a legal opinion classifying the products as guns under state law. The Commonwealth Court lawsuit asks a state judge to stop the state police from implementing any new policy, including background checks, based on a legal opinion the agency received Monday from Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro. Shapiro told state police to treat unassembled “ghost guns,” gun frames also referred to as 80% receivers, as firearms. The plaintiffs said the opinion does not give fair notice to people regarding what is legal and what is not, said Joshua Prince, who filed the petition.\\n\\nRhode Island\\n\\nProvidence: State lawmakers are unveiling bills they plan to pursue in the new legislative session that begins Jan. 7. Democratic Reps. June Speakman of Warren and Terri Cortvriend of Portsmouth said they will introduce legislation establishing a state-level process to set maximum contaminate levels for toxins, including a family of industrial chemicals turning up in public water supplies across the country. Democratic Sen. Leonidas Raptakis of Coventry said he will reintroduce legislation that stalled in past years to establish an inspector general’s office to identify fraud and waste in public spending. Raptakis will also again propose allowing voters to vote on a constitutional amendment to give the governor the power to veto parts of the state budget. Most states allow governors to strike individual budget items without having to veto an entire appropriations bill. Democratic Rep. Joseph Solomon of Warwick said Thursday he has prefiled legislation to cap the amount health insurance providers can charge for insulin co-pays. Solomon said he’s concerned about rising costs.\\n\\nSouth Carolina\\n\\nCharleston: A unique, dome-shaped house on the South Carolina coast dubbed “Eye of the Storm,” has recently been sold for $4million. The Post and Courier reported that according to Charleston County land records, a firm called ITAC 433 LLC that lists a Chapel Hill address, bought the 3,384-square-foot house in early October. The distinctive house features a white shell that resembles a Storm Trooper helmet from the movie “Star Wars.” It was built in the early 1990s by Huiet and Helen Paul after their beachfront home was destroyed in 1989 by Hurricane Hugo. The house is made of concrete and steel and weighs 1.3million pounds. It includes an elevator, wet bar, skylight, an 889-square-foot deck and a bank vault room. The seller was a trust associated with the late couple. The property was marketed as hurricane-resistant because its design doesn’t have seams for strong winds to hook onto, the newspaper reported. The design is also intended to allow storm surge to pass through several openings on the lower level. The house’s unique architecture in comparison to the more antebellum homes often seen on the island attracts curious onlookers. But even at a $4million price tag, the dome house isn’t the most expensive to be sold on the island. Last summer a 5,000-square-foot, three-story house fetched $7.35million.\\n\\nSouth Dakota\\n\\nPierre: Tribes in South Dakota are trying again to gain state legislative support to repeal an archaic law that bans them from Minnesota. The State-Tribal Relations Committee voted this week to introduce a resolution during the 2020 legislative session requesting that Congress repeal the 1863 Dakota Removal Act. The law forced Native Americans onto South Dakota reservations following an 1862 conflict that included the mass hanging of 38 Dakota men. Minnesota passed a resolution supporting its repeal in 2009. The South Dakota Senate State Affairs Committee, without any discussion, failed to pass the same resolution during the 2019 session. Republican Rep. Tamara St. John, a historian for the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe, said she’s concerned that repealing it could impact legal precedents based on the act, specifically a lawsuit involving Mdewakanton Sioux members in Minnesota that has not been resolved.\\n\\nTennessee\\n\\nNashville: Tennessee has landed a $5.3million federal grant that aims to address opioid misuse among expectant mothers and improve care for their affected children, the Division of TennCare announced Thursday. TennCare plans to partner with Vanderbilt University Medical Center to focus on the issue in 26 rural and urban counties. Tennessee is one of 10 states to receive the Maternal Opioid Misuse Model grant from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Tennessee’s initiative will focus on expectant mothers and their children beginning in pregnancy and extending to one year postpartum. The money covers a five-year performance period beginning in January. The program aims to get the women engaged in treatment before and after pregnancy, use therapies to maximize the time they aren’t using illicit substances, reduce infant hospital stays to keep them with their biological mothers as much as possible and connect to early intervention services for the children.\\n\\nTexas\\n\\nHouston: Police said one woman was killed and another was injured after they were attacked by three pit bulls. Authorities said a man called 911 just before 6 a.m. Saturday to report that his wife had been attacked by dogs in a north Houston neighborhood. At the scene, police found the woman had been bitten multiple times. She was taken to a hospital and was expected to survive her injuries. Soon after arriving at the scene, police received another call, this one from the dogs’ owner. The owner reported his dogs had attacked a woman and her body was in a ditch in front of his home. The three dogs were taken away by authorities. Police said the case will be referred to the Harris County District Attorney’s Office to determine if any charges could be filed against the dogs’ owner.\\n\\nUtah\\n\\nHyrum: A northern Utah bank is dismantling and rebuilding a historic small-town grain elevator for its new “Scandinavian-modern” building in Hyrum. The tall wood structure, now weathered with age, was first built in 1918 by the Holley-Globe and Milling Company, the Herald Journal reported. It has been a fixture in the small town for a century, but soon it will get a new life: front and center into Cache Valley Bank’s new location. Workers began lifting sections of the structure with a crane this week. The bank wanted a building that was creative and embodied the town. Board member Peter Daines said his grandfather, a high school shop teacher and Hyrum native, informed their decision to incorporate the rustic appeal of the historic wood on the agricultural storage structure. Bank CEO George Daines remembered seeing the big tower when while visiting his grandparents as a child, though it wasn’t in operation even then. Visitors to the new bank building, though, will be able to reach the top through a spiral staircase. It will also have a new all-glass observation deck.\\n\\nVermont\\n\\nMonkton: A general in Monkton is going to close its doors by the end of the month. The Alderman family, which has managed the store for more than 12 years, said the costs of operating the business are “just too much,” MyNBC5 reported. The closing comes less than a year after the Aldermans announced they were struggling to pay back approximately $20,000 in delinquent state taxes. An online fundraising campaign brought in nearly $9,000 over the course of eight months. In a social media post, the Aldermans said they appreciated the community’s support and expressed their sadness in having to close.\\n\\nVirginia\\n\\nRichmond: State health officials are mounting an effort to identify people who might have recently been exposed to a person with measles. The Virginia Department of Health said in a news release Saturday that the person visited Richmond International Airport on Tuesday night and a doctor’s office in suburban Richmond on Thursday afternoon. The department posted detailed instructions online about what to do if you were at either of the locations during certain time frames. The directions depend on whether you have been vaccinated against measles. Based on the date of exposure, the health department said people infected could develop symptoms as late as Jan. 11. Measles is a highly contagious illness spread through coughing, sneezing and contact with droplets from the nose, mouth or throat of an infected person. Symptoms include a fever, runny nose, watery red eyes and a cough, followed by a rash that begins on the face and spreads all over the body.\\n\\nWashington\\n\\nSeattle: Officials are warning about the Asian giant hornet, a new invasive species found in the state that can pack a powerful sting and be a threat to honeybees. The Washington State Department of Agriculture said the bug was found in early December in Blaine, near the Canadian border. The state’s agriculture and health officials are now warning people in the area to be on the lookout and avoid the hornets, which are typically 1.5 inches long with large yellow heads. The species is not usually interested in humans or animals but might sting if they or their ground nests are disturbed or threatened. The health department said humans should take preventative measures by covering food and garbage and also avoid swatting at the hornets. Winter is the dormant season for the bugs, which are more often seen from July through October.\\n\\nWest Virginia\\n\\nElkins: The U.S. Forest Service has halted a logging project in Monongahela National Forest to protect an endangered fish. The Center for Biological Diversity and Friends of Blackwater submitted objections in July to the project to protect the endangered candy darter. The Center for Biological Diversity said in a news release the project would likely have caused significant erosion and sent sediment into rivers and streams, threatening the rare fish. The candy darter was listed as endangered in November 2018.\\n\\nWisconsin\\n\\nMilwaukee:A judge has reinstated a felony count against a Milwaukee man who was living in an underground bunker that contained a stash of weapons, generator and various power tools. Geoffrey Graff, 41, was originally charged with two felonies after police discovered the bunker while investigating a report that he fired a shot into the nearby Milwaukee River. A court commissioner earlier this month dismissed one of the charges, for recklessly endangering safety. Milwaukee Circuit Judge David Borowski reinstated the charge on Thursday, the Journal Sentinel reported. Graff is facing a separate felony charge of possessing a short-barreled shotgun. Graff told authorities he had been using the bunker for at least seven years.\\n\\nWyoming\\n\\nSaratoga: The U.S. Forest Service has bought the last piece of private land within a wilderness area in central Wyoming. The 80-acre purchase in Carbon County will allow members of the public to roam the Huston Park Wilderness without the worry of crossing into private land, Forest Service officials said Friday. The land is located just north of Colorado-Wyoming state line and is part of the Medicine Bow National Forest in the Sierra Madre mountain range. Congress designated the 31,000-acre Huston Park Wilderness in 1984 and officials have since been seeking to buy up private lands inside its boundaries.

      "Document(text='The Giants’ season finale Sunday against the Eagles will help determine the winner of the NFC East.\\n\\nPhiladelphia (8-7) seized the inside track on that postseason berth with a tight 17-9 home victory over fading Dallas, giving the Eagles a chance to clinch their second division title in three seasons in Week 17 at MetLife Stadium.\\n\\n“We are built for this moment,” Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz said. “Play with so much confidence, so much swagger, that everyone in the stadium can feel you. That playoff atmosphere, you can’t beat it.”\\n\\nBeleaguered coach Jason Garrett and the Cowboys (7-8) have dropped four of their past five games following a 6-4 start. They must defeat Washington in their regular-season finale, and hope the Eagles lose to the Giants, to take the East with a .500 record.\\n\\n“We all expected to leave here as NFC East champions. We’re not,” Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said.\\n\\n“We all have to own it,” Garrett added. “Unfortunately, we don’t control our destiny anymore. But we control our opportunity next week at Washington.”\\n\\nWentz completed 31 of 40 for 319 yards, including a 6-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dallas Goedert in the first quarter.\\n\\nDak Prescott, playing with a sore shoulder and damaged finger on his throwing hand, finished 25-for-44 for 265 yards. But his fourth-down pass intended for Michael Gallup was broken up by Eagles cornerback Sidney Jones in the final minute.\\n\\n“I had an opportunity,” Prescott said. “I just didn’t make the play.”\\n\\nStill Hot In Cleveland\\n\\nThe Ravens clinched home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs with their 11th consecutive victory, a 31-15 win over Cleveland.\\n\\nLamar Jackson threw three touchdown passes, giving him 36 for the season to break Vinny Testaverde’s franchise record. The MVP front-runner also ran for 103 yards to extend his NFL rushing record for quarterbacks (1,206).\\n\\n“It feels good. The players deserve a tremendous amount of credit for it,” Baltimore coach John Harbaugh said after his team improved to 13-2. “It’s hard to win any game in the NFL. When you put together this kind of season, it’s quite an accomplishment.”\\n\\nAnother “Hot in Cleveland” reference continues to be the Browns’ sideline, where former Giants receiver Odell Beckham Jr. became the latest Cleveland player to get into a heated exchange with coach Freddie Kitchens.\\n\\nAfter the Browns (6-9) were eliminated from the playoffs for a 17th consecutive season, both OBJ and Kitchens insisted that the jawing was about the officiating and not directed at each other.\\n\\n“We were just talking,” said Beckham, who flung his helmet at the Cleveland bench as he came off the field. “[It was] the refs making calls.\\n\\n“Basically, they were warning me that if I had one more personal foul, then I would be out of the game, which I thought was pretty stupid. I got a personal foul for a celebration I’ve done all year. It’s not like a player was in front of me or anybody was. It was very unintentional. It is what it is.”\\n\\nClash of the Titans\\n\\nDespite a 38-28 home loss to New Orleans, the Steelers’ loss to the Jets means Tennessee (8-7) still can clinch the second wild-card berth in the AFC with a win Sunday at Houston. Pittsburgh (8-7) would secure that spot with a win over the Ravens — who could be resting players with their seeding locked in — and a Tennessee loss.\\n\\nThe Raiders still remain barely alive for a wild-card berth following their 24-17 victory over the Chargers, although Oakland (7-8) still needs plenty of help to qualify.\\n\\nIn addition to defeating the Broncos on the road, the Raiders also obviously would need both Pittsburgh and Tennessee to lose again — plus the Colts to defeat Jacksonville and Cleveland to down Cincinnati to clinch amid a four-way tiebreaker scenario at 8-8.\\n\\nNew England (12-3) can clinch the No. 2 seed in the AFC with a Week 17 win against Miami or a loss by the Chiefs in their last game against the Chargers after Kansas City (11-4) took care of Chicago, 26-3, Sunday night.\\n\\nFor All The Marbles\\n\\nThe league has flexed the 49ers-Seahawks clash in Week 17 to Sunday night, and the game will determine the winner of the NFC West, with the loser slipping to the No. 5 or No. 6 seed for the postseason.\\n\\nSeattle’s costly 27-13 loss to Arizona dropped Pete Carroll’s team (11-4) one game behind San Francisco — and likely cost the Seahawks a shot at the NFC’s top seed — but a victory over the Niners still would give them the division title.\\n\\nThe Cardinals led 20-7 early in the third quarter, before Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray left with a hamstring injury and was replaced by backup Brett Hundley.\\n\\nA blocked punt set up a Seattle field goal to cut the deficit to 10 points, before kicker Jason Myers added a 51-yarder for a 20-13 game with 10 minutes remaining. But Arizona’s Kenyan Drake (166 rushing yards) ran it in from 3 yards out with 4:18 remaining for his second touchdown of the game.\\n\\nThe New Standard\\n\\nMichael Thomas eclipsed Marvin Harrison’s record for receptions in one season as New Orleans also moved to 12-3 with its win at Tennessee.\\n\\nThomas hauled in 12 catches for 136 yards and a late 2-yard touchdown to give him 145 receptions with one week remaining, two more than Harrison amassed for the Colts in 2002.\\n\\n“We’re trying to play and go to a championship right now,” Thomas said. “At the end of the season, we’ll look up and see all the things we accomplished. But right now, we’re focused on one common goal, and that’s a championship.”\\n\\nThe NFC South champs still have a shot at the No. 1 seed with a Week 17 win at Carolina, a loss by San Francisco to Seattle and one loss by Green Bay (11-3) either Monday night against Minnesota (10-4) or Sunday against Detroit.\\n\\nTanks For Nothing\\n\\nCincinnati overcame a 35-12 deficit in the fourth quarter with two Andy Dalton touchdown passes and two-point conversions in the final minute of regulation, before Miami pulled out a 38-35 win on Jason Sanders’ 37-yard field goal as time expired in overtime.\\n\\nDalton finished with 396 passing yards and four touchdown passes — two to Tyler Boyd — but the Bengals fell to 1-14 and clinched the first overall pick in the draft. Ryan Fitzpatrick also had four TD throws, including one to defensive tackle Christian Wilkins, with 419 passing yards for the Dolphins (4-11).\\n\\nThe Hurt Locker\\n\\nRavens running back Mark Ingram left Sunday’s game with a calf injury and will undergo an MRI exam Monday. Reporters in Cleveland noted that the former Heisman Trophy winner was seen wearing a protective boot after the game. Another former Heisman winner, Titans running back Derrick Henry was inactive against the Saints with a hamstring injury. Panthers wide receiver D.J. Moore and Colts guard Quenton Nelson suffered concussions. Redskins quarterback Dwyane Haskins (ankle) and Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph (shoulder) were injured against the Giants and Jets, respectively. Eagles cornerback Ronald Darby suffered a hip flexor injury.\\n\\nPost Patterns\\n\\nPanthers running back Christian McCaffrey joined Thomas in setting a single-season receiving record, eclipsing the mark he set last season for running backs. His 15 catches for 119 yards in Carolina’s 38-6 loss to Indianapolis boosted his season total to 109, two more than his 2018 total. McCaffrey needs 67 receiving yards next week against New Orleans to join Roger Craig (1985) and Marshall Faulk (1999) as the only backs in NFL history with at least 1,000 yards rushing and receiving in one season. … Panthers quarterback Will Grier, Carolina’s third-round draft pick out of West Virginia, took over for benched Kyle Allen and threw three interceptions in his NFL debut. … Colts running back Nyheim Hines had punt returns of 84 yards and 71 yards for touchdowns for Indianapolis (7-8). … Saints running back Alvin Kamara scored his first two touchdowns since Week 3. … Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan threw for 384 yards and running back Devonta Freeman scored twice as Atlanta improved to 6-9 with a 24-12 win over Jacksonville (5-10). … Broncos running back Philip Lindsay ran for 109 yards and one touchdown in Denver’s 27-17 win over Detroit (3-11-1). … Raiders quarterback Derek Carr completed 26 of 30 passes for 291 yards and a touchdown pass to wide receiver Hunter Renfrow in Oakland’s win over the Chargers.\\n\\nThree Stars\\n\\n1. Lamar Jackson, Ravens QB\\n\\nThe MVP frontrunner threw for three touchdowns with no interceptions (improving to 36 TDs vs. 6 INTs this season) and rushed for 103 yards in Baltimore’s 31-15 win over Cleveland.\\n\\n2. Ryan Fitzpatrick, Dolphins QB\\n\\nFitzpatrick went 31-for-52 for 419 yards and four touchdown passes — and he also led the winning field-goal drive in overtime — in Miami’s 38-35 win over Cincinnati.\\n\\n3. Nyheim Hines, Colts PR\\n\\nHines became the first player in Colts history to return two punts for TDs — a 84-yarder and a 71-yarder — and totaled a team-record 195 return yards in Indianapolis’ 38-6 win over Carolina.\\n\\nHe Said What?\\n\\n“I guess Jason Garrett has to go take an Uber home.”\\n\\n— Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham, referring to the Dallas coach’s job security.\\n\\nFantasy Insanity\\n\\nThe good news for all those fantasy owners of Saquon Barkley, Alvin Kamara or Devonta Freeman: Those players finally delivered performances worthy of their draft position — during fantasy championship week, no less. The bad news: If you were counting on them during the season, you probably didn’t make the playoffs.\\n\\nThose who were relying on Chris Carson, Derrick Henry, Nick Chubb, D.J. Moore, Tyler Lockett, Amari Cooper, Zach Ertz or Kyler Murray, chances are you failed to captured your league crown based on ill-timed injury or dud performances.\\n\\nDaniel Jones proved once again he can be a fantasy juggernaut. For the fourth time this season, he scored 28 fantasy points or better — a season-high 35.3 on 352 passing yards and five passing touchdowns. Word of wisdom before you start putting him near the top of your QB ratings for next season: He also has five games of 12.3 FP or fewer.\\n\\nIf your league includes Week 17 in its playoff format, find a new league. Imagine, for example, Lamar Jackson carrying you all season only to not have him in the title game, if he sits next week.\\n\\n— Drew Loftis Giants can blow up NFC East playoff scenario 12-2019', doc_id='65122c6d-5207-4123-af71-2d7840a8333b', embedding=None, doc_hash='f94f167d2ae1dd9eefa3bac2f400368a4773c44d3a10078f97e9ee58989153c4', extra_info=None)\n"
