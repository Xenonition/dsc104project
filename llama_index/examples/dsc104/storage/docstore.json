voters went to the polls there and in seven other states to pick candidates who will face off in the Nov. 6 midterm elections, when control of the U.S. House and Senate will be up for grabs.\n\nThe fate of President Trump\u2019s legislative priorities will hang in the balance in November. Right now Republicans control both the House and Senate, but a swing of just 23 seats would give Democrats a House majority. The GOP holds a narrow majority of 51 seats in the Senate, with Democrats controlling 47 seats and independents who caucus with Democrats holding two seats.\n\nCalifornia, home to the nation\u2019s largest congressional delegation with 39 Democrats and 14 Republicans, has a so-called \u201cjungle primary.\u201d All candidates initially competed on a single ballot Tuesday. The two who come out on top go on to the general election, regardless of political party. This makes it possible for two Democrats or two Republicans to face each other in November.\n\nThe Democrats had hoped the jungle primary might give them a leg up on their campaign to win back control of the U.S. House of Representatives by capturing at least a few of the 14 seats the GOP currently holds in California \u2013 half of which Hillary Clinton carried in the 2016 presidential contest.\n\nWhat analysts have missed all over the country is that while the Democrats are able to maintain political power in places like the Golden State, they\u2019ve not be able to stop the state\u2019s slide into economic and social oblivion.\n\nGoing into Tuesday it looked like there might be a few seats \u2013 notably the Anaheim-area seat of retiring Republican Ed Royce \u2013 where the Republicans might be shut out of the general election.\n\nThat appears not to have happened \u2013 not in the Royce seat, not in the San Diego-area seat of retiring GOP Rep. Darrell Issa, and not in Huntington Beach where Republican Dana Rohrabacher, a former speechwriter for President Reagan seeking a 16th term, easily made it into the next round.\n\nThe failure to achieve what some were calling a \u201cbig, blue shutout\u201d also didn\u2019t extend to the gubernatorial contest. Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom easily advanced to the second round of balloting as did Republican businessman John Cox, who had the endorsement of President Trump.\n\nFormer Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa \u2013 whom some hoped might make it into the runoff in place of Cox, setting up an all-Democratic general election contest that could have had a depressive affect on GOP turnout statewide \u2013 drew only about half as much support as Cox and finished a distant third.\n\nThis is quite a turnaround from what people were expecting even just months ago. The Trump presidency, in the considered opinion of some political experts, should have been the final nail in the coffin of the once robust, Reagan-producing, California GOP.\n\nIt might still. The latest figures show there are more voters in the state who\u2019ve chosen to register as unaffiliated than who signed up as Republicans, with people blaming everything from the national party\u2019s stance on immigration and abortion to the Trump tweets for the GOP\u2019s weakness.\n\nWhat analysts have missed all over the country is that while the Democrats are able to maintain political power in places like the Golden State, they\u2019ve not be able to stop the state\u2019s slide into economic and social oblivion.\n\nAnother factor is President Trump himself. His national approval numbers in polls have risen to a point somewhere in the mid-to-upper 40s, much higher than many analysts thought and most Democrats believed he\u2019d ever be.\n\nThat means the suburban, college-educated, mostly white, Republican married women who appeared to desert Trump in droves in November 2016 (and who either voted for Clinton or just didn\u2019t vote) may be starting to come home to the GOP, at least as far as voting for other Republicans is concerned.\n\nThis analysis is supported by two other figures, both of which presage a competitive, perhaps even victorious national GOP effort in the fall. The Real Clear Politics average has nearly 40 percent of those surveyed saying the country is \u201con the right track.\u201d That\u2019s", "doc_id": "2823174e-2bab-45ef-8fc9-c80cef7fdda7", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "44b849fdee3cea3d23d10c0e86538179f739f5525a08f18059d8de0c49281479", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4179, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "5cbbe921-8c56-49e7-a0e0-dbf3a756545e", "3": "7a2d5c52-a513-4cd7-b38e-971799f15f6f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a2d5c52-a513-4cd7-b38e-971799f15f6f": {"__data__": {"text": "saying the country is \u201con the right track.\u201d That\u2019s about 13 points better than what it was during President Obama\u2019s last year in the White House.\n\nThe number of people who say America is \u201cheaded in the wrong direction\u201d is also down by about a third from where it was at the end of the Obama era.\n\nThat\u2019s not a ringing endorsement for things as they are, but it does suggest the next national election will not be a \u201cchange\u201d election like the last one was. Voters seem to like their tax cut and approve of the fact the country\u2019s economic engine has restarted.\n\nPeople are going back to work, the unemployment rate among all Americans is the lowest in decades and the black and Latino unemployment rates have never been this low since statistics have been compiled.\n\nAll that news helps incumbents, which this year means the GOP. The generic ballot test, where voters are asked whether they intend to vote for a Republican or a Democrat in the next election, is now just about even. Several months ago, before the tax cut passed and in the thick of unending daily chaos coming out of the White House, the Democrats had a double-digit advantage.\n\nAll this carries over into other states that held primaries on Tuesday. This was true in places like New Jersey, where the president has problems, and in the \u201cTrump Country\u201d states of South Dakota, Alabama and Montana.\n\nIn other states:\n\nALABAMA\n\nAlabama interim GOP Gov. Kay Ivey \u2013 who took office upon the resignation of her Republican predecessor \u2013 easily won nomination for her own term. She goes into the general election a heavy favorite against Democrat Walt Maddox.\n\nIn the closely watched Republican primary in the state\u2019s 2nd District, which runs from Dothan and the Gulf Coast up to the suburbs of Montgomery, incumbent Martha Roby \u2013 who upset some Republican voters after she condemned President Trump for his \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape \u2013 was forced into a runoff against the man she beat when first elected, former Democrat turned Republican Bobby Bright.\n\nIOWA\n\nIn Iowa, interim Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds \u2013 who replaced Terry Branstad as governor when President Trump appointed Branstad U.S. ambassador to China \u2013 ran unopposed for the GOP gubernatorial nomination and is a heavy favorite to win a term on her own.\n\nThe Hawkeye State has no U.S. Senate race this year. Only one of the state\u2019s four incumbent House members \u2013 Republican Steve King \u2013 is considered safe. GOP incumbents David Young in the 3rd District (in the southwestern corner of the state) and Rod Blum (in northeastern Iowa\u2019s 1st District) may have tough contests in the fall, even though both were unopposed in the primary.\n\nIn the 2nd District, which is in the southeastern part of the state and includes Iowa City, Democrat Dave Loebsack \u2013 who, like his Republican general election challenger Chris Peters ran unopposed it the primary \u2013 will have to contest with an electorate that sent him to Washington for sixth time, while Donald Trump carried for the district by just over 4 points.\n\nMISSISSIPPI\n\nMississippi has two U.S. Senate seats to be decided in November, but only the seat held by Republican Roger Wicker was affected by Tuesday\u2019s primary. Wicker easily prevailed in his primary and enters the race favored to win against either Democrats Howard Sherman or David Baria, who will fight it out in a runoff election later this year.\n\nThe contest for the seat that came vacant upon the retirement of longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran will be decided at a later date.\n\nMONTANA\n\nIn Montana, state Auditor Matt Rosendale emerged from a field of four to win outright the chance to take on two-term incumbent Democrat Jon Tester in the race for U.S. Senate.\n\nPresident Trump carried the state in 2016 by more than 200,000 votes and has singled out Tester as someone he\u2019d like to see replaced. But Tester\u2019s numbers are good.

Bob Menendez won renomination, taking 62 percent of the vote against a relative unknown. He\u2019ll face Republican pharmaceutical executive Bob Hugin in the fall.\n\nMenendez may be tainted by ethics problems that should render him vulnerable, but the state GOP is still in disarray after the drubbing it took in last year\u2019s gubernatorial elections. It also doesn\u2019t help that there are at least 10 seats in the U.S. Senate currently held by Democrats that are just better targets.\n\nThe Garden State is also home to two seats which went one way for Congress and the opposite way for president in 2016. In one, the 5th District, which sits like a cap across most of the top of the state, Trump beat Hillary Clinton by a single point while Democrat Josh Gottheimer was picked to go to Congress. This time Gottheimer will face Republican John McCann, who won the GOP primary 53 to 47 percent.\n\nIn the 7th District in 2016, Republican Leonard Lance won his seat on the Pennsylvania side of the state by 11 points, as Clinton was carrying it 48.6 to 47.5 percent. In November he\u2019ll face Democrat Tom Malinowski.\n\nThese seats are on the watch list kept by both parties, at least for now, as is northern New Jersey\u2019s open 11th Congressional District. That\u2019s a longtime GOP stronghold where voters picked former state Republican Chairman Jay Webber and Democrat Mikie Sherrill as the nominees for November.\n\nNEW MEXICO\n\nIn New Mexico, Republican Rep. Steve Pearce from the 2nd Congressional District, which covers the southern half of the state, and Democrat Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham from the Albuquerque-centered 1st District will face one another in the fall contest to replace term-limited GOP Gov. Susanna Martinez, the nation\u2019s only currently serving Hispanic chief executive.\n\nThe seats Lujan Grisham and Pearce are vacating are reliably partisan, so the outcome of the congressional primaries will likely determine who the winner will be in November. The U.S. Senate race, where Democrat Martin Heinrich is seeking a second term, is not expected to develop into much of a contest.\n\nSOUTH DAKOTA\n\nFinally, in South Dakota, GOP voters picked Republican Kristi Noem, the state\u2019s lone member of the U.S. House of Representatives as their candidate for governor. Noem easily defeated state Attorney General Marty Jackley in a race that started ugly and ended even uglier. If elected she would become the state\u2019s first woman governor.\n\nDemocrat Billie Sutton ran unopposed for his party\u2019s nomination for governor, as did the party\u2019s congressional candidate, Tim Bjorkman. Looking to replace Noem in the House is Republican Dusty Johnson, who starts the race a prohibitive favorite, given Trump carried the state by better than 30 points and 100,000 votes in 2016.

Republican businessman John Cox captured second place, due to strong support from President Trump.\n\nCox will be a strong advocate for the president`s pro-growth economic record in California. This will be a sharp contrast to Democrat Gavin Newsom`s ultra-liberal objectives, which will only continue California`s charge into the abyss.\n\nAlso worth noting is that a Democratic state senator in California was recalled for voting for gas tax increases, costing California Democrats the supermajority in the Legislature necessary to raise taxes even more.\n\nFresh off one of the best jobs reports in years, voters came to the polls in the eight states where primaries were held with growing optimism and a feeling that there is reason to feel good again in America.\n\nHardworking Americans understand full well that voting for a Democrat for the U.S. House or U.S. Senate is a vote against the Trump prosperity and security agenda that has paved the way for the lowest unemployment rate in 18 years (3.8 percent), the highest consumer confidence in 17 years, the decimation of ISIS, and the return of American respect around the globe.\n\nWhen folks consider the fact that nearly 3 million jobs have been created since President Trump took office, they are rightly nervous to give House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the chance to once again become speaker of the House with a Democratic majority.\n\nIn the Republican Senate primary in Montana, conservative state Auditor Matt Rosendale prevailed in a crowded field.

Jon Tester \u2013 who has become Cryin` Chuck Schumer`s puppet in the D.C. swamp \u2013 or vote for Rosendale, a reform-minded Washington outsider.\n\nIn New Jersey, Republicans nominated Republican businessman and Washington outsider Bob Hugin.

And that\u2019s all that matters. Senate Republicans may have already won the optics war when it comes to \u201ccancelling recess.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, it was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who decided that the Senate - not the House \u2013 would forgo four of the five weeks designated for the hallowed \u201cAugust recess.\u201d\n\n\u201cDue to the historic obstruction by Senate Democrats of the president\u2019s nominees, and the goal of passing appropriations bills prior to the end of the fiscal year, the August recess has been canceled. Senators should expect to remain in session in August to pass legislation, including appropriations bills, and to make additional progress on the president\u2019s nominees,\u201d said McConnell.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m damn glad,\u201d opined Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., about the schedule change. \u201cLouisianans understand that good things come to those who work their ass off. I\u2019m ready to work nights. Weekends. All of August. Christmas. Whatever it takes.\u201d\n\nBut some are unsure whether the \u201cAugust recess\u201d gambit is really about getting work done or not. Democrats note that of the 33 Senate seats up this year, 24 fall on their side of the aisle. Meantime Republicans must only defend nine seats.\n\nMany of the Democratic seats are in battleground or GOP-leaning states like Indiana, West Virginia and Montana. Most of the Republican seats are in solid conservative states. So, leashing vulnerable Democrats to Washington to prevent them from campaigning may not be a bad strategy if you want to boost a narrow 51-49 GOP seat advantage in the Senate\u2026if that\u2019s in fact the tactic.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, suggested none of this matters. The politics. The perception. He says there\u2019s actual work to do.\n\n\u201cOther than perhaps us here inside the Beltway, folks back home really couldn\u2019t give a flip,\u201d said Cornyn.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, embraced the new schedule.

First of all, Democrats don\u2019t control the Senate floor. Secondly, health care polls highly as an issue important to voters. Democrats may want to fix some of the problems.

Graham and Cassidy tried their health care maneuver last September. The rejuvenation of the health care debate could prompt a similar scenario this year just before the midterms if Democrats overplay their hand.\n\nIt was President Trump who demanded the Senate labor in Washington this August. And so Schumer turned the tables on the President.\n\n\u201cNow that the Majority Leader has acceded to President Trump\u2019s demands on the August schedule, We want the President to be here in Washington working with us as well because he has caused a lot of these problems, said Schumer. \u201cWe presume he won\u2019t be jetting off to Bedminster or Mar-a-Lago or spending countless hours on the golf course.\u201d\n\nWhether Mr. Trump acquiesces to Schumer\u2019s request is unclear. But Democrats created an interesting political wedge to deploy against the President and Republicans. And despite all of the breathlessness about August, many aren\u2019t sure how much the Senate will truly be here.\n\nLast year, McConnell announced in mid-July the Senate would remain in session for half of the August recess. They wound up working three and a half days and then bolted for the month after senators reached a deal to confirm a slate of 77 nominees.\n\nMcConnell made the announcement about August this year in early June. The decision was a GOP shot across the bow of Democrats: back off their requirement that the Senate burn inordinate hours each week on routine nominations. Relent and perhaps you won\u2019t have to hang out in Washington come August.\n\nSchumer argues Democrats aren\u2019t making life difficult for GOP nominees.\n\n\u201cMitch McConnell can\u2019t have it both ways. He spends all of his time bragging to his base that they\u2019ve confirmed more judges than anyone else and now he\u2019s saying they haven\u2019t confirmed enough,\u201d said Schumer.\n\nStill, McConnell\u2019s announcement in June about the August threat gives leaders nearly two months to reach a pact on nominations. Or, they may even forge an arrangement where the Senate appears it\u2019s in session a lot in August - and it is. But the Senate only convenes with a skeletal staff with most senators only returning once or twice a week to cast roll call votes.\n\nThis is why the August plan may just be about optics.\n\n\u201cCongress needs to do its job,\u201d said Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., the most-vulnerable Republican senator this midterm cycle.\n\nIf there\u2019s a GOP senator who needs to spend time campaigning this year, it\u2019s Heller. Still, saying the right things about working in Washington in August resonates with voters.\n\n\u201cIf that means we that we need to remain on the floor of the U.S. Senate on the weekends, overnight and through the month of August to make more progress, then we should do it,\u201d said Heller.\n\nBut retiring Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., was more skeptical of the purported August workaholicism.\n\n\u201cI doubt we\u2019ll be there the whole time,\u201d said Flake. \u201cTypically when people smell jet fumes, they find a way to be a little more cooperative.\u201d\n\nIn other words, senators will get an itch to run to the airport and fly home to campaign, go on family vacations or work stateside on important issues. That\u2019s why the dam broke last year. Senators reached an accord and remained in Washington less than a handful of days rather than 14.\n\nSo McConnell cancelled the August recess.

The same goes for your estimation of her show in the first place.\n\nSo powerful is the draw of political tribalism that people are now increasingly able to turn their tastes on a dime in order to conform with what is politically correct.\n\nBarr\u2019s act in the show that it produced is all about being shocking. It was shocking when she spit and grabbed her way through the national anthem and it was shocking when she and her TV character so brutally assaulted conventional norms about middle class marriage and family.\n\nA generation ago she was admired on the left for skewering June Cleaver expectations for media moms. This time around her admirers have been mostly on the right since she has adopted her support for President Trump as her preferred outraged generation device.\n\nLike a lot of middle aged white dudes who suddenly started appreciating Kanye West\u2019s rhymes, Trump supporters were excited to see someone who unabashedly rooted for the president, even if it was just an exercise in trolling liberals. After all it seems like that\u2019s the point of a lot of what Republicans do these days. It tends to matter less whether something is good or bad or even congruent with a philosophy as much as it matters that something will \u201cmake heads explode.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Democrats express strange new respect for ultra conservative Republicans, like Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., or even Attorney General Jeff Sessions when they bedevil Trump. And political correctness in cultural choices has a much longer history on the left side of the aisle. Surely no living human could endure a set of Kathy Griffin\u2019s comedy unless they believe they were doing it for a political cause.\n\nBut now, Republicans are fully engaged in the act. This isn\u2019t just the wistful nostalgia of Pat Boone or Wayne Newton from the Reagan era. This is full blown art as cultural weapon.\n\nIf you are fool enough to allow strangers to dictate your likes or dislikes in music, movies, books and television there\u2019s not much we can tell you. You drank the Kool-Aid and are mixing up another pitcher.\n\nWe don\u2019t know whether or not the president will stay strong with Barr in light of her racist remark. Her comment came in support of the kind of batty conspiracy theories in which some in the president\u2019s orbit \u2013 and sometimes the president himself \u2013 have trafficked.\n\nTrump has in the past defended racists and kooks who were part of his broader political tribe. This is, after all, a guy who gave an interview to Alex Jones.\n\nAnd it\u2019s potentially useful for Trump to embrace the idea of Barr as a victim. This would work well with his general narrative that middle class white voters are being persecuted. There are obvious down sides in aligning oneself with someone with a record like Barr\u2019s, but the president has already taken that leap with her. If whole controversy creates an enormous, divisive uproar, then it would fit very well with the president\u2019s overall political style.\n\nIt is too late to try to get politics out of art and popular culture.

But the Senate isn\u2019t ready to take up the issue after a thoroughly unproductive immigration debate in February, followed by months of radio silence. And lawmakers are growing more and more worried the upper chamber could be blindsided by a call to action later this year. The House, meanwhile, has become a hotbed of immigration debate \u2014 and it\u2019s preparing to take up one or several Republican bills in June.

He suggested he did not want Jackson, who has served as a White House physician since 2006, to go through such an \u201cugly\u201d and \u201cdisgusting\u201d process and said he told him: \u201cWhat do you need it for?\u201d\n\nThe comments come after The New York Times and others reported that Jackson has been accused of overseeing a hostile work environment as White House physician, drinking on the job and allowing the overprescription of drugs.\n\nAmid the allegations, his confirmation hearing originally set for Wednesday was postponed.\n\nThe postponement was confirmed to Fox News late Monday night by South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. Rounds said committee Chairman Sen.

Jon Tester, the top Democrat on the committee, issued a joint statement saying the hearing was postponed \"in light of new information\" presented to the committee.\n\n\"We take very seriously our constitutional duty to thoroughly and carefully vet each nominee sent to the Senate for confirmation,\" they said.\n\nThe senators have also sent a letter to Trump requesting all information regarding any improper conduct pertaining to Jackson\u2019s service in the White House Medical Unit and as physician to the president.\n\nThe White House issued a statement earlier Tuesday standing by the pick.\n\n\u201cAdmiral Jackson has been on the front lines of deadly combat and saved the lives of many others in service to this country,\" Hogan Gidley, deputy White House press secretary, said Tuesday. \"He\u2019s served as the physician to three presidents -- Republican and Democrat -- and been praised by them all.

Jon Tester has somehow kept a low profile in Congress. That`s until he caught the attention of Americans \u2014 and President Donald Trump \u2014 by airing startling allegations that toppled Veterans Affairs nominee Ronny Jackson.\n\nIt`s not necessarily the kind of high-stakes debut political strategists would dream up for Tester, a plain-spoken Montana Democrat running for re-election in a Trump-won state with more veterans per capita than almost any other. But the deed is done. Trump is responding. And now it`s game on in a midterm race that could help determine control of the Senate.\n\n\"I want to tell you that Jon Tester \u2014 I think this is going to cause him a lot of problems in his state,\" Trump said Thursday on \"Fox & Friends.\"\n\nTrump is still defending Jackson, the Navy rear admiral who served three presidents as a White House physician but withdrew from consideration for the VA position Thursday among allegations of drinking, overprescribing prescription drugs and fostering a hostile work environment.\n\nJust as vigorously, Trump turned his sights on Tester, and is likely to swoop in to campaign against the senator.

It would have been a \"dereliction of duty\" not to investigate, he said. And even though the claims were not fully probed or proven true, he says it was important to bring them forward publicly for the sake of transparency.\n\n\"It`s about doing the best thing you can do to make sure you got a great country,\" he said.\n\nTester`s happy to invite Trump to Montana for a look-see at the challenges in rural America. Montana is home to nearly 100,000 veterans, among a population of 1 million, and the president`s trade tariffs are worrying some farmers.\n\n\"I welcome him to come out any time and we`ll talk about the issues that are important to Montana,\" Tester said. \"I`ll continue to work with him when I can, and hold him accountable when I must.\"\n\nThe Senate race in Montana will be among THOSE watched this fall, PART OF a constellation of red-state contests where Republicans want to pick off Democrats to bolster their slim 51-49 majority.\n\nFlipping the Montana seat may be easier on paper than practice. Sure, Trump won Montana by 20 percentage points in 2016 and remains popular in the state.\n\nBut unlike many other senators, Tester is running with a recognizable brand of his own, as a third-generation farmer near the little town of Big Sandy, a former teacher who started in politics on the school board. He hardly looks like he`s gone Washington.\n\nIt`s far from clear that the president`s attack will hurt the senator. Trump plucked Tester`s main rival, Ryan Zinke, from a potential race by tapping him for Interior Secretary, leaving several candidates scrambling for the GOP nomination.\n\nThey pounced on the opportunity to align with Trump against the two-term incumbent.\n\n\"He`s not a supporter of the president,\" said one, Russ Fagg, a retired judge. \"It`s an attempt to cozy up to a president who is popular in our state, and it`s disingenuous.\"\n\nCandidates Matt Rosendale, the state auditor, and Troy Downing,", "doc_id": "52ea7f92-bd9d-4a54-b5d2-1a63262d996a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b46cf7aa96d2438d2484b33bb4e8892eb72e2b70b71da73afc2cd67c6fcb5256", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3856, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "5f7d69bd-bc4d-407e-8bef-7cfb0716f3c2", "3": "fe3f4b24-1524-44a0-afb8-c44376ab9450"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe3f4b24-1524-44a0-afb8-c44376ab9450": {"__data__": {"text": "Matt Rosendale, the state auditor, and Troy Downing, a businessman, also criticized Tester for his role in releasing what they called unsubstantiated claims against Jackson.\n\n\"Our view is this race gets more competitive by the week, and entirely because of what Tester is doing,\" said Steven Law, the president at CEO at the Senate Leadership Fund, a super political action committee aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\nOthers though, say Trump`s attack could actually help.

Among the allegations, Jackson was accused of getting drunk and wrecking a government vehicle after a Secret Service going-away party.\n\nTester, the top Democrat on the Republican-controlled Senate Veteran Affairs Committee, is seeking a third Senate term this year in a state Trump won in 2016 with 56 percent of the vote.\n\nOn Friday, the White House pushed back again the allegations, saying records, including police reports, show Jackson was in three minor vehicle incidents in government vehicles during the last five years, but none involved the use of alcohol and he was not found to be at fault.\n\nIn one case, a side-view mirror was clipped by a passing truck, while in another incident an enraged driver in Montgomery County, Maryland, allegedly punched out Jackson\u2019s window during a morning drive to Camp David.\n\nIn addition, the White House medical unit Jackson ran found that he successfully passed regular controlled substance audits, according to the records for the last three years. The reviews did recommend improvements to the medical unit\u2019s handling of controlled substances but did not find misconduct.\n\nThe Associated Press reviewed the documents Friday. They were the result of an internal White House review of allegations raised against Jackson during his brief confirmation process. The White House said the records, covering recent years, disprove the allegations.\n\nTester\u2019s office has not specified the time frame during which the alleged misconduct occurred. The senator\u2019s spokeswoman Marnee Banks said the office would not comment until it knew more about the White House records.\n\nSeparately, the Secret Service said it has no evidence to support an allegation that its personnel intervened to prevent Jackson from disturbing former President Barack Obama during a foreign trip in 2015.\n\nIn a statement dated Thursday, the Secret Service said it had conducted a \u201cthorough review\u201d of internal documents related to Obama\u2019s foreign trips in 2015 and interviewed people who were present. The agency said it has found \u201cno information that would indicate the allegation is accurate\u201d and no record of any incident involving Jackson.\n\nCNN had reported allegations that Jackson drunkenly banged on the hotel room door of a female employee and that Secret Service personnel intervened out of concern that he would wake Obama.\n\nJackson has denied the accusations, calling them \u201cbaseless and anonymous attacks\u201d on his character and integrity that are \u201ccompletely false and fabricated.\u201d\n\nAsked about the situation at a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Trump called the Jackson situation \u201can absolute disgrace.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese were false accusations about a great man; about a man who has a son who\u2019s a top student at Annapolis; about a man that\u2019s given his life to this country, and to the military \u2014 a brave man. He would have been a great leader,\u201d Trump complained, noting that he, Obama and former President George W. Bush had all praised the doctor\u2019s conduct in the past.\n\nTrump said he\u2019d called Jackson earlier Friday and told him that", "doc_id": "5a05b0b7-df49-485f-97c9-d7557e920936", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "776a3cc775de015be4813b13e7880e9fa5902a1fe14143225db11427ea45e5ac", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4136, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "2635ca5f-5d8b-43a8-a17d-5a0e42d47c8a", "3": "d8bbbe92-ed82-48d2-82a4-fe2d66f8274a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8bbbe92-ed82-48d2-82a4-fe2d66f8274a": {"__data__": {"text": "the past.\n\nTrump said he\u2019d called Jackson earlier Friday and told him that he was \u201can American hero\u201d because he\u2019d \u201cexposed the system for some horrible things.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic staff on the committee considering Jackson\u2019s nomination also claimed Jackson had doled out such a large supply of a prescription opioid that staffers panicked because they thought the drugs were missing.\n\nThey said their allegations were based on conversations with 23 of Jackson\u2019s current and former colleagues at the White House Medical Unit.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

Jon Tester, D-Mont., who raised allegations against Jackson, to resign, writing in two tweets: \u201cAllegations made by Senator Jon Tester against Admiral/Doctor Ron Jackson are proving false.

Not fair, Tester!\u201d\n\nOn the same day Jackson withdrew his name to become VA secretary, President Trump was meeting with a group of veterans in the White House. It was an ironic piece of Washington theater.\n\nThe veterans were brought together by the Wounded Warrior Project for Soldier Ride, an annual four-day cycling event designed to give veterans a positive physical experience.\n\nAs the president was standing with the veterans, reporters were outside the White House explaining how Jackson became the latest White House casualty due to a series of unsubstantiated allegations by anonymous people.\n\nThe day before, President Trump said Jackson would have his backing if he decided to fight for the nomination, but that the president didn\u2019t think the battle would be worth the struggle.\n\nThis left Jackson, a doctor who President Obama had given high praise to in reviews, wondering what to do. Should he fight a list of allegations being peddled by Tester if he didn\u2019t have the president\u2019s vociferous support?\n\nTester, the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee, had taken allegations public by saying on CNN that Jackson was known as \u201cthe candy man\u201d to staffers in the White House and that Jackson would give drugs to passengers traveling with the president overseas to \u201cput them to sleep and then give them the drugs to wake them back up again.\u201d\n\nIsn\u2019t that easily explained, as it is common for someone flying across time zones to another continent to take an Ambien?\n\nAlso, accusations that Jackson denies hit the news claiming that he had been drunk on the job and that he even crashed a government car while under the influence. Jackson said he doesn\u2019t even know where that one came from.\n\nClearly, Jackson\u2019s biggest problem was that he worked in the Obama White House, as this gave former Obama staffers an air of authority when they allegedly told Tester and other Democrats inside gossip.\n\nWhat\u2019s more bothersome is that President Trump didn\u2019t understand this was a fight he had to win. This came as the Trump White House has been repeatedly weakened by leaks and has lost a number of staffers. The Democrats don\u2019t just smell blood \u2013 they are drawing blood.\n\nThe Trump administration did make a tepid fight of it, but did so while falling back on their heels.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite unusual for a United States senator to take allegations that have not been fully investigated, but to flaunt them to the national public to suggest he\u2019s the \u2018candyman.\u2019 I think is outrageous,\u201d said White House Legislative Director Marc Short.\n\nPresident Trump also called in to \u201cFox & Friends\u201d to say that Tester \u201chas a big price to pay\u201d in Montana.\n\nMaybe, but those counterpunches were thrown from an off-balance position when the Trump administration should have been on offense.\n\nThese kinds of ploys from Democrats are stall tactics to keep the Trump administration from pushing forward with the agenda that voters put Donald Trump in the White House to enact.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a trivial Washington", "doc_id": "a014003a-94f8-4814-9f39-c28a86966dc4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5caa6d6ef828db3894c4f5edeeb5282792f00e47418ccdf76325f21ab073555f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3991, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "a20523b4-f5e3-4b89-b588-59781d1f6a66", "3": "41f44e7e-3a34-40f1-9803-63157d178ef2"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "41f44e7e-3a34-40f1-9803-63157d178ef2": {"__data__": {"text": "White House to enact.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a trivial Washington melodrama.

Debbie Stabenow as one of the Democrats who needed to be voted out of office.\n\nTrump took aim at familiar political targets and added a few fresh ones Saturday night at the rally in Washington Township.\n\n\"Debbie Stabenow is one of the leaders for weak borders and letting people in. I don`t know how she gets away with it,\" Trump said. \"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It`s very simple. It`s also a vote for much higher taxes.\"\n\nStabenow, who is running for re-election to her fourth term, fired back Sunday that voters are sick of the partisanship.\n\n\"Michigan families are tired of political attacks,\" said her spokeswoman, Miranda Margowsky. \"Instead they want results, and that`s exactly what Senator Stabenow has done.\"\n\nIn Michigan, Trump also directed his ire at another Democratic senator, Jon Tester of Montana, over his role in the failed nomination of White House doctor Ronny Jackson to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. Tester, too, faces a competitive re-election race this year.\n\n\"I know things about Tester that I could say, too. And if I said `em, he`d never be elected again,\" Trump said without elaborating.\n\nTester, the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, had his staff compile a list of allegations against Jackson based on interviews with more than 20 military personnel, and they released it with the support of the Republican committee chairman.\n\nJackson was a surprise pick by Trump for VA secretary. The White House was criticized for skipping crucial vetting of nominees and letting lawmakers to clean up the mess.\n\nAs he has at similar events, Trump promoted top agenda items that energize conservatives: appointing conservative judges, building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, ending sanctuary cities and protecting tax cuts approved by the Republican-led Congress. He also took credit for the warming relations between North and South Korea, telling his audience, \"We`ll see how it goes.\"\n\n\"Great evening last night,\" the president tweeted early Sunday. \"The enthusiasm, knowledge and love in that room was unreal. To the many thousands of people who couldn`t get in, I cherish you ... and will be back!\"\n\nTrump chose a friendly venue for his rally, which not coincidentally came the same night as the annual White House Correspondents` Dinner.

After one crass joke drew groans from the audience, Wolf laughed and said, \"Yeah, shoulda done more research before you got me to do this.\"\n\nBefore the Michigan rally, Trump had said in a fundraising pitch that he had come up with something better than being stuck in a room \"with a bunch of fake news liberals who hate me.\" He said he would rather spend the evening \"with my favorite deplorables.\" In Michigan, Trump urges voters to support GOP for Congress 4-2018", "doc_id": "1b9bffc9-8518-4723-818a-82ff98b16842", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ed1909136b93d6ef85be067024c444185d34d9c6825c15238be4fd1536e01d1c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3466, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "47e6bf2f-1d51-46cc-934a-ccb0dc0c5d46"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "86090123-c30a-485c-b71b-d200ecc27020": {"__data__": {"text": "\u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d just opened in theatres.

Trump last year set a deadline of early March to end the protections, but has indicated he wants to provide permanent protections for the young illegal immigrants -- along with border security, particularly funding for his U.S.-Mexico border walll.\n\nUnder the apparent deal to end the filibuster, Schumer said Monday they would negotiate on immigration, and immediately consider such legislation if there\u2019s no agreement by Feb. 8.\n\nSchumer lauded the bipartisan group\u2019s weekend efforts and suggested the group could lead efforts to replace DACA with permanent, legislative protections.\n\nHowever, he also needled Trump, whom he said on Friday rejected his compromise plan that included money for the border wall.\n\n\u201cToday we enter the third day of the Trump shutdown,\u201d Schumer said before saying they would provide the votes to get to the spending bill.

For Democrats in particular, Saturday`s dramas began on Friday evening.\n\nThose who couldn`t watch it live awoke to stories and viral clips of Obama lambasting his successor twice in a six-hour span at rallies for Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum in Florida, where he is running for governor, and Stacey Abrams, the former state House minority leader doing the same in Georgia.\n\nAt Morehouse College in Atlanta, Obama answered Trump`s jab from earlier in the week, when the Republican President said Abrams -- owner of an estimable political r\u00e9sum\u00e9 -- was \"not qualified\" for the job that she and Georgia`s GOP Secretary of State Brian Kemp are at about even odds to win next week.\n\n\"Republicans -- they keep trying to diminish Stacey`s remarkable accomplishments,\" Obama said, without mentioning Trump by name. \"She is the most experienced, most qualified candidate in this race. She`s got an incredible track record of fighting for working families.\"\n\nBut on Friday night and Saturday morning, her campaign was forced to contend with a racist and anti-Semitic robocall targeting Abrams and Oprah Winfrey. The calls, which came from the same neo-Nazi group that previously attacked Gillum in Florida, were denounced by Kemp as \"absolutely disgusting.\"\n\n\"I stand against any person or organization that peddles this type of unbridled hate and unapologetic bigotry,\" Kemp said in a statement.\n\nAbrams` campaign wasn`t impressed, and in a statement Saturday morning suggested Kemp`s harsh words were undermined by his behavior on the trail and his scheduled embrace of Trump at a rally on Sunday.\n\n\"It is pathetic that after months of running racist, sexist attacks against Stacey Abrams, Brian Kemp has only now suddenly decided to find a conscience as polls are tightening and Georgia voters are making it clear that they reject the kind of hate he and his allies have been spewing around the state,\" spokeswoman Abigail Collazo said. \"These automated calls are being sent into homes just days before President Trump", "doc_id": "42f260f9-7a66-464a-b909-3ba8696b2b9e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1dd9710634bc42749d297c89910ccb5310f567c4f83aff1ba740fdca6ae88ce3", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3960, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "d01a6e17-ce6f-45ca-9e4f-846b5d3fd490", "3": "f56103ef-62b4-4e97-a2a4-0a6f49934eaa"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f56103ef-62b4-4e97-a2a4-0a6f49934eaa": {"__data__": {"text": "said. \"These automated calls are being sent into homes just days before President Trump arrives, reminding voters exactly who is promoting a political climate that celebrates this kind of vile, poisonous thinking.\"\n\nBefore Trump touches down in Georgia, he is due on Saturday night in Florida \u2014 his second trip there over four days \u2014 for a rally in Pensacola, another traditionally Republican stronghold up in the state`s Panhandle, and the next day in Tennessee to campaign for Republican Senate candidate Rep. Marsha Blackburn.\n\nTrump gave a howling hint of what to expect over the campaign`s furious final few days during a Friday stop in Indiana.\n\nReciting faithfully from what has become his midterm songbook, he touted Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh`s confirmation and issued yet another ominous -- and almost entirely fact-free -- warning about a group of migrants, hundreds of miles and weeks away in Mexico, headed for the US border in search of asylum.\n\n\"Between Justice Kavanaugh and the caravan, you people are energized,\" Trump enthused, a message he re-upped at length in Montana.\n\nTrump vs. Obama\n\nHe also took on Obama, who had hours before assailed him for, among other things, \"constant fear-mongering\" and chronic dissembling and telling outright falsehoods about the GOP`s efforts, past and present, to dismantle the Affordable Care Act`s protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nIn Miami, Obama called it \"gall\" and \"chutzpah\"; in Atlanta, he labeled it \"some kind of gumption\" and \"some kind of nerve.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump responded to Obama`s barrage by mocking the former president over what he described as a \"very small crowd\" in Miami. Later on, though, at a rally for Senate candidate Mike Braun in Indiana, the President struck a nastier note.\n\n\"It`s no surprise that (Democratic Sen.)

Ron DeSantis, who was boosted in his bid for the nomination by the President`s endorsement, is hoping for another lift with his campaign running consistently off Gillum`s pace. The Democrat took a brief break from the trail early Saturday morning in the aftermath of a deadly shooting at a yoga studio in Tallahassee, where he is the mayor.\n\nReturning to the trail, Gillum, an outspoken proponent of stricter gun control laws, said the killings in his city only upped the stakes of the coming election, while urging voters to \"reject the politics of Trumpism.\"\n\nEven as the campaign back-and-forth dominates the headlines, the beginning of the weekend also belonged to the grassroots liberal groups that have quietly been gearing up for a massive, final get-out-the-vote push.\n\nOne coalition initiative, aptly named The Last Weekend, will be put to the test now after months of organizing and promotion. Swing Left, which is leading the effort, and has raised more than $9 million for candidates in 84 swing districts this cycle, says its volunteers called and knocked on the doors of nearly 500,000 voters just last week.\n\nThey expect that number to skyrocket as Election Day nears.

But he stopped short of saying that helped Rosen.\n\nMontana State University political scientist Dave Parker said polling in his state showed public lands were not a significant factor in Tester`s victory.\n\nAt minimum, the big retailers have pushed public lands into the spotlight, said Kayje Booker of the Montana Wilderness Association.\n\n\"These national brands have a reach that nonprofit advocates could only dream of, and they have been using that megaphone in a really effective way to remind people of this issue,\" she said.\n\nOrganizers of the winter outdoor show, which is drawing about 950 exhibitors and 25,000 attendees over three days, are preparing to fight another potential government shutdown to protect national parks, which were left understaffed and underprotected during the 35-day shutdown that just ended.\n\nColumbia weighed in on the previous shutdown with a full-page ad in the Washington Post that mimicked Trump`s campaign slogan: \"Make America`s parks open again.\"\n\nThe outdoor industry, which calculates its annual sales at $184.5 billion, was once reluctant to get involved in high-profile advocacy.\n\n\"We would like nothing more than to be thinking about a great hike instead of thinking about politicians,\" said Peter Bragdon, executive vice president of Columbia Sportswear.\n\nSome companies and industry groups say they have always openly advocated for public lands and recreation, but Trump`s election brought new players and energy to the fight.\n\n\"I would say the thing that`s changed is when President Trump was elected, some of the threats to our public lands became more high profile,\" said Amy Roberts, executive director of the Outdoor Industry", "doc_id": "799cd93a-1638-4aa7-acd8-10bd5af33336", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "640f87568fc75a60b2c3ebec5eed059b2e5fdbcb2c7fa59118632c9beca29154", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4143, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "f8c134cd-d818-4c16-8554-dfa98208edd2", "3": "bdb0c7af-f113-42ac-93a3-cb8ab4cf07dd"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "bdb0c7af-f113-42ac-93a3-cb8ab4cf07dd": {"__data__": {"text": "lands became more high profile,\" said Amy Roberts, executive director of the Outdoor Industry Association.\n\nThe industry began to stir in February 2017, when Utah lawmakers asked Trump to repeal the newly designated Bears Ears National Monument. Thirty outdoor companies objected, and the Outdoor Retailer Show announced it would move from its longtime home in Salt Lake City to Denver.\n\nThings heated up in December 2017 when Trump reduced the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. Patagonia sued and declared on its website, \"The President Stole Your Land.\"\n\nInterior Department spokeswoman Faith Vander Voort defended the administration`s record, saying it had expanded access to public lands and revived their use for ranching, mining, logging, drilling and other commercial purposes as well as recreation.\n\nAlthough Trump removed land from national monuments in Utah, it still belongs to the federal government, Vander Voort said in an email Wednesday.\n\n\"Organizations like Patagonia knew this, but they chose instead to play fast and loose with the facts,\" she said.\n\nExecutives at REI, the giant outdoor-gear cooperative with 17 million members, said it`s important to avoid casting public lands as a partisan fight. That would be a disservice to everyone who has ever fought for public lands, said Alex Thompson, an REI vice president.\n\n\"We`re trying to balance being really engaged and really clear ... while also not falling into the trap of fueling unhelpful divides,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Dan Elliott at http://twitter.com/DanElliottAP .

One option or another, we will resolve this,\" Lowey said earlier in the day.\n\nUntil this weekend, the biggest sticking point for the group had been how to deal with the president\u2019s demand for a $5.7 billion wall along the southern border. During the last shutdown, Democrats refused to give him the money, saying the wall would be costly and ineffective.\n\nLast week, they explored a compromise involving some sort of structure, though the figures discussed were far less than Trump\u2019s initial request.\n\n\u201cI think that we expect that if the evidence supports the notion for enhanced fencing moving forward, that we will find some bipartisan consensus,\u201d House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries of New York said last week.\n\nThe president and Shelby expressed optimism about a deal last Thursday.\n\nBy Sunday, Shelby was less hopeful.\n\n\u201cI think the talks are stalled right now,\u201d Shelby said on \"Fox News Sunday,\" adding that the disagreement centered on Democrats` demands for a cap on detentions by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\n\nDemocrats said ICE routinely detains more immigrants than it needs to, imprisoning those who don\u2019t have criminal backgrounds and pose no threat to national or domestic security. That\u2019s why they want to set a hard cap on the number of immigrants ICE detains, the goal being to force the agency to focus its resources on violent criminals.\n\n\u201cThis agency needs checks and balances, so the Republicans want to get more wall money and Democrats want to get controls on ICE. This is what a negotiation looks like,\u201d said", "doc_id": "37da4cdc-f628-475b-a6bb-2dc895b7343d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "57b989097084d74e1d911bf7aa6dbe2110222dde6848753c11f0149398a0b088", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3919, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "d1052b17-7bde-4050-8831-26ea67392859", "3": "ae15c06f-0fe1-4461-a142-9ea7e871a24c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae15c06f-0fe1-4461-a142-9ea7e871a24c": {"__data__": {"text": "to get controls on ICE. This is what a negotiation looks like,\u201d said Kerri Talbot of the advocacy group Immigration Hub.\n\nRepublicans said a detention cap would force the release of undocumented immigrants in custody and warned of the risk that many might not show up for scheduled hearings on whether they should be deported.\n\nMatthew Albence, deputy director of ICE, said a cap on ICE detainees would be \"damaging to public safety.\"\n\n\"We will immediately be forced to release criminal aliens sitting in our custody\" if the cap is put in place, Albence said.\n\nIn a tweet Monday morning, Trump accused the Democrats of a brand new demand, and he told reporters ICE was \"very disrespected by the Democrats.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats do not want us to detain, or send back, criminal aliens! This is a brand new demand. Crazy! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 11, 2019\n\nLater in the morning, on the Senate floor, McConnell piled on, accusing Democrats of \"a poison-pill demand\" at \"the 11th hour.\"\n\nLowey expressed surprise at McConnell`s comments Monday afternoon: \"I`ve worked with Mitch McConnell, and we`ve accomplished a lot together. I`m sorry that is his interpretation of where things are.\"\n\nHouse Democrats pointed out that the 16,500 cap on ICE beds has been part of the Democrats` proposal since it was first included in their opening offer Jan. 31.\n\n\"How the government deals with ICE is a very important issue, and that`s why the beds are so critical to this negotiation, period,\" Lowey said.\n\nFederal data show that violent criminals make up a minority of the immigrants in ICE detention. The most common charges against those immigrants are driving under the influence, traffic violations, drug charges and immigration violations.\n\nThe Trump administration reversed an Obama-era policy of focusing its immigration enforcement efforts on undocumented immigrants with serious criminal records. Under the Obama administration, ICE agents were ordered to find and arrest specific undocumented immigrants with criminal records and to not arrest other immigrants who happened to be in the area at the time of the arrest. Trump overturned that policy, allowing ICE agents to arrest any suspects they come across during their day-to-day operations.\n\nThat has led to a rapid drop in the percentage of arrested immigrants who have a criminal record.\n\nSen. Jon Tester \u2013 a member of the conference committee and a moderate Democrat from Montana \u2013 said Monday that he was hopeful before the meeting between the appropriations group`s leaders.\n\n\"I`ve talked to both sides,\" Tester said. \"I think there is a sweet spot to be found here, where both sides can claim victory.\"\n\nLast month, the government reopened after the longest partial government shutdown on record: 35 days.\n\nIf Congress can\u2019t reach a deal that the president supports, funding for about a quarter of the government will run out and 800,000 workers could be forced to go without pay, again.\n\nWhite House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday that a shutdown was \u201cstill on the table. We do not want it to come to that, but that option is still open to the president and will remain so.\u201d\n\nContributing: Alan Gomez, John Fritze\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/11/government-shutdown-lawmakers-scramble-deal-deadline-looms/2838302002/ Government shutdown: Lawmakers near a solution to avoid shutdown as Friday deadline looms 2-2019", "doc_id": "ae15c06f-0fe1-4461-a142-9ea7e871a24c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "63e82b3d96c5ffd0e20f6acdf7f4374322389ddb2734f6de8459b18c40dd0a2e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3851, "end": 7316, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "d1052b17-7bde-4050-8831-26ea67392859", "2": "37da4cdc-f628-475b-a6bb-2dc895b7343d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "39e5f77f-bfca-435e-a64d-b8f5d29746b5": {"__data__": {"text": "The concern over Dr. Jackson\u2019s nomination is bipartisan and emerged after Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee interviews with more than 20 people, including current and former military personnel who had worked with him.

In doing so, he came closer than ever to publicly acknowledging that he is a disciple of what Richard Nixon dubbed the \u201cmadman theory\u201d of foreign policy.\n\nThe president gleefully recounted his own bellicosity to suggest that his rhetoric scared North Korean leader Kim Jong Un into coming to the table in pursuit of peace. \u201c\u2018Fire and fury,\u2019 \u2018Total annihilation,\u2019 \u2018My button is bigger than yours,\u2019 and \u2018My button works.\u2019 Remember that? \u2026 And people said, \u2018Trump is crazy,\u2019\u201d Trump said in the Rose Garden. \u201cAnd you know what it ended up being? A very good relationship. I like him a lot, and he likes me a lot.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s comments are instructive ahead of his second summit with Kim on Wednesday in Hanoi, where he just touched down on Air Force One. The North Korean leader arrived overnight via train. \u201cNobody else would have done that,\u201d Trump said of his willingness to escalate tensions with Pyongyang in a bid to ultimately defuse them. \u201cThe Obama administration couldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d\n\n-- When Trump seems crazy to his critics, sometimes he is being crazy like a fox. Friends and former aides say he is more aware than most people think of how he\u2019s perceived at home and abroad. He has repeatedly sought to use his reputation for rashness and unpredictability to his advantage, sometimes successfully.\n\nTrump is not wrong that his threats have packed more of a punch because foreign leaders think he might go through with them. For example, no one would have believed Barack Obama or George W. Bush if either of them threatened to scuttle NATO or NAFTA to prod allies to spend more on defense or improve the terms of existing trade deals. People also wouldn\u2019t have believed past presidents if they had tweeted they were going to impose stiff tariffs on all Chinese imports.\n\nYet many serious people really thought a year ago that there was some possibility Trump might actually go through with a preemptive strike on Pyongyang after all his charged rhetoric, despite American military commanders warning that such a move could lead to tens of thousands being killed. In other words, Trump\u2019s intimidations have seemed more credible because he\u2019s gladly encouraged the global perception that he\u2019s quarrelsome.\n\nThe president has preached the virtue of strategic unpredictability as a lever to gain the upper hand in negotiations. \u201cWe must as a nation be more unpredictable,\u201d Trump said as a candidate in 2016. \u201cWe have to be unpredictable!\u201d\n\nPresident Trump confers with Henry Kissinger in the Oval Office in October 2017. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\n-- A generation ago, when the eyes of the world were on Hanoi for a very different reason, Nixon wanted to convince the Soviets and their North Vietnamese clients that he was an unstable hothead who was willing to use nuclear weapons. The goal was to bring an end to the quagmire at the negotiating table.\n\n\u201cI call it the madman theory,\u201d Nixon explained to H.R. Haldeman, who would serve as his White House chief of staff, while they walked along a foggy beach one day in 1968, according to Haldeman\u2019s memoir. \u201cI want the North Vietnamese to believe I\u2019ve reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We\u2019ll just slip the word to them that, \u2018For God\u2019s sake, you know Nixon is obsessed about communism. We can\u2019t restrain him when he\u2019s angry \u2014 and he has his hand on the nuclear button!\u2019 And Ho Chi Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace.\u201d\n\n-- Nixon certainly didn\u2019t invent the concept; he just coined the term.

Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli wrote back in 1517 that \u201cat times it is a very wise thing to simulate madness.\u201d\n\n-- Trump has long admired Nixon, and he signaled even before taking office that he\u2019d embrace the madman theory. Henry Kissinger, the nonagenarian who was tasked back in the day with \u201cslipping the word\u201d that Nixon might just be wacky enough to use The Bomb, has tutored Trump on foreign policy and repeatedly given him advice before big meetings with heads of state, including Kim and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nDuring an April 1971 conversation, which was recorded and has now been transcribed, Nixon told Kissinger that he should try to break an impasse in peace talks by hinting to Hanoi that the use of nuclear weapons was back on the table.\n\n\u201cYou can say, \u2018I cannot control him.\u2019 Put it that way,\u201d Nixon told his secretary of state.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Kissinger replied. \u201cAnd imply that you might use nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Nixon, adding that Kissinger should say: \u201cI just want you to know he is not going to cave.\u201d\n\n-- Game theory experts teach that acting irrationally can sometimes be very rational. Trump plainly believes he\u2019s a good bluffer, even when his bluffs get called again and again. The fact that he doesn\u2019t always fold right away, even when he has a losing hand, has strengthened his capacity to keep others on their toes.\n\nConsider the partial government shutdown, which became the longest in American history. Even though he ultimately caved, and declared a national emergency to try getting the money Congress would not appropriate for a wall, Trump showed he was willing to drag out the fight. He kept it going even as his polling numbers took a hit.\n\nThe same is true on the world stage. He\u2019s kept the door open to military intervention in Venezuela, even as he orders a drawdown of troops in Syria and Afghanistan. He\u2019s also saber-rattled against Iran since pulling out of the nuclear deal. And he said during his State of the Union this month that he would be willing to spend whatever is necessary to win an arms race with the Russians. All these moves are risky and might backfire over the long term, but Trump appears to believe he is setting the terms of the debate.\n\n-- Ever the showman, Trump recognizes the power of fear. Indeed, Bob Woodward\u2019s entire book last year (\u201cFear\u201d) was based on this premise.\n\n-- Trump has even advised his own aides to tell people on the outside that he is \u201ccrazy\u201d if they think it will help in negotiations. During an Oval Office meeting in September 2017, Trump told chief trade negotiator Bob Lighthizer that he should threaten to have the U.S. withdraw from its free trade agreement with South Korea. Axios reported this exchange at the time:\n\n\u201cYou`ve got 30 days, and if you don`t get concessions, then I`m pulling out,\u201d Trump told Lighthizer.\n\n\u201cOkay, well I`ll tell the Koreans they`ve got 30 days,\" Lighthizer replied.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\" Trump interjected. \"That`s not how you negotiate. You don`t tell them they`ve got 30 days. You tell them, `This guy`s so crazy he could pull out any minute!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThat`s what you tell them: Any minute,\u201d Trump continued.\n\nDuring an Oval Office meeting this past Friday focused on defusing the trade war that he started, Trump once again admonished Lighthizer \u2013 this time in front of a Chinese delegation. The veteran lawyer was rebuked by Trump for saying the two sides were working on a \u201cmemorandum of understanding.\u201d Trump said the term, routinely used in situations like this, does not \u201cmean very much.\u201d The president also did this in front of reporters.

And that\u2019s just the way he wants it.\n\n-- The irony, of course, is that the madman theory did not ultimately work for Nixon. Vietnam remains one of the most humiliating chapters in America\u2019s history. New York University historian Tim Naftali, the former director of the Nixon presidential library, says North Vietnam more likely came to the table for other reasons. He also argues that Nixon played the part of a madman to give himself domestic cover with his base to open relations with China and pursue detente with the Kremlin.\n\n\u201cNixon\u2019s madman strategy wasn\u2019t supposed to take three and a half years, over 21,000 U.S. deaths, and untold Vietnamese losses, to work. It was supposed to be a version of `shock and awe,\u2019\u201d Naftali wrote for the Atlantic in 2017. \u201cThere can be little debate, however, over what Nixon\u2019s calculated unpredictability abroad achieved at home. It tore this country apart. In a declassified \u2018eyes only\u2019 memorandum to Alexander Haig on May 20, 1972, after ordering the mining of Haiphong harbor, Nixon explained who his domestic audience was: \u2018The hawks are our hard core and we must do everything that we can to keep them from jumping ship [in reaction to arms-control talks with Moscow] after getting their enthusiasm restored as a result of our mining operation in the North.\u2019\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost`s morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\n-- British Prime Minister Theresa May for the first time admitted that Brexit may be delayed, as a bitterly divided Parliament struggles over how \u2014 or even if \u2014 Britain should leave the European Union. William Booth and Karla Adam report from London: \u201cMay told lawmakers that if Parliament next month rejects her Brexit deal again, the lawmakers will be given a vote on whether to ask the European Union to allow Britain to remain a part of the trading bloc for several more months. May said that if such an extension were triggered, it would likely be granted only once and that the time would be \u2018short and limited.\u2019 She suggested an extension until June would be possible, so as not to collide with upcoming elections for the European parliament. This was a major concession by May, who has insisted that not only is her Brexit deal the best and only one on offer, but that it would be reckless to delay leaving the European Union beyond March 29. \u2026 Now May is offering compromise in a series of possible votes, each one based upon the results of the one before.\u201d\n\n-- India launched an airstrike into Pakistan-controlled territory in retaliation for the terrorist attack earlier this month that killed 40 Indian paramilitary officers in Kashmir. A spokesman for Pakistan`s military said there were no casualties, while the Indian foreign ministry said there were \u201ca large number of casualties.\u201d Joanna Slater reports: \u201cIndia\u2019s foreign secretary, Vijay Gokhale, told reporters that the strike targeted a training camp run by Jaish-e-Muhammad, the Pakistan-based militant group that claimed responsibility for the attack this month. ... Gokhale ... said the Indian strike was based on \u2018credible intelligence\u2019 that further attacks were being planned by Jaish-e-Muhammad, which is designated a terrorist organization by the United States.

If I were the leader of the Constitution\u2019s Article II branch, I would probably declare an emergency and use all the tools at my disposal as well. But I am not. I am a member of the Senate, and I have grave concerns when our institution looks the other way at the expense of weakening Congress\u2019s power. It is my responsibility to be a steward of the Article I branch, to preserve the separation of powers and to curb the kind of executive overreach that Congress has allowed to fester for the better part of the past century. I stood by that principle during the Obama administration, and I stand by it now.\u201d\n\n-- A group of 26 Republican former members of Congress signed an open letter opposing the declaration. John Wagner reports: \u201cThe letter argues that Trump is encroaching on Congress\u2019s \u2018power of the purse\u2019 and urges current lawmakers to stand up for its constitutional powers. \u2018We who have served where you serve now call on you to honor your oath of office and to protect the Constitution and the responsibilities it vested in Congress,\u2019 says the letter.\u201d Its signers are former senators John Danforth (Mo.), Chuck Hagel (Neb.), Gordon Humphrey (N.H.), Richard Lugar (Ind.) and Olympia Snowe (Maine) and 21 former House members.\n\n-- Trump, who has promised to veto a rejection of his emergency declaration, warned Republicans against defecting. \u201cBe strong and smart,\u201d he tweeted, \u201cdon`t fall into the Democrats \u2018trap\u2019 of Open Borders and Crime.\u201d\n\nReality check: The House will probably pass the disapproval resolution. Even if the Senate follows suit, however, Trump has promised to veto the measure, and there aren\u2019t enough votes in Congress to override such a veto. The issue is likely to be tied up in the courts a long time, however.\n\nTHERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- Almost certainly alluding to Bob Mueller\u2019s impending report, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein argued that the Justice Department should not reveal information about people it does not charge with crimes. Matt Zapotosky reports: \u201cRosenstein conceded there \u2018may be legitimate reasons for making exceptions,\u2019 but he felt the Justice Department generally should be sensitive \u2018to the rights of uncharged people.\u2019 \u2026 The comments seem to foreshadow what could be a grueling legal battle between Congress and the Justice Department over what information about Mueller\u2019s work ultimately is released. The regulations that govern Mueller\u2019s work require him to submit to the attorney general a confidential report detailing whom he charged \u2014 as well as who was investigated and not charged. The attorney general is then to notify Congress that Mueller\u2019s investigation has ended. The regulations do not require the attorney general or Mueller to make significant details public, although they do not prohibit officials from doing so.\u201d\n\n-- Paul Manafort\u2019s attorneys urged a judge last night to sentence Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman to less than 10 years in prison, arguing that he has been treated harshly by the special counsel and unfairly vilified. Spencer S. Hsu and Rachel Weiner report: \u201cManafort \u2018is presented to this Court by the government as a hardened criminal who \u2018brazenly\u2019 violated the law and deserves no mercy.

But this case is not about murder, drug cartels, organized crime, the Madoff Ponzi scheme or the collapse of Enron,\u2019 the attorneys wrote in a memo filed in U.S. District Court in Washington. \u2026 The defense said Manafort was unduly singled out for prosecution by the special counsel\u2019s office for \u2018garden-variety\u2019 financial crimes and \u2018esoteric\u2019 foreign lobbying disclosure violations but not, they said, on charges that showed any links between the Russian government or individuals and the campaign. \u2026 The two wide-ranging conspiracy charges to which Manafort pleaded guilty in Washington carry a maximum sentence of 10 years. \u2026 Manafort\u2019s attorneys asked for any sentences to run concurrently. \u2018In light of his age and health concerns, a significant additional period of incarceration will likely amount to a life sentence for a first time offender,\u2019\u201d his attorneys said.\n\n-- Although Mueller\u2019s name has captured headlines, it has been one of his lead prosecutors, Andrew Goldstein, who has questioned Trump\u2019s associates and negotiated with his attorneys about a potential interview. The New York Times\u2019s Noah Weiland and Michael S. Schmidt profile the former high school teacher and Time magazine reporter: \u201cMr. Goldstein, the lone prosecutor in Mr. Mueller\u2019s office who came directly from a corruption unit at the Justice Department, has conducted every major interview of the president\u2019s advisers. \u2026 And he was one of two prosecutors who relayed to the president\u2019s lawyers dozens of questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior in office that Mr. Mueller wanted the president to answer under oath. The questions showed the Mueller team\u2019s hand for the first time: extensive, detailed lines of inquiry that could imperil the presidency. \u2026\n\n\u201cAs evidence built over two years, Mr. Goldstein functioned as a repository of conversations that Mr. Trump had with lawyers, advisers and top law enforcement officials from early 2017 on. Among Mr. Goldstein\u2019s jewels, according to Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers: exhaustive notes taken by Annie Donaldson, Mr. McGahn\u2019s former chief of staff, which detailed in real time Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior in the West Wing. \u2026 Like Mr. Mueller, Mr. Goldstein wears starched white dress shirts to work and prizes secrecy. Mr. Goldstein told a friend, Tim Lear, that Mr. Mueller even complained to his prosecutors about being photographed near Donald Trump Jr. at an airport.\u201d\n\nMichael Cohen, Trump`s former personal attorney, leaves Capitol Hill on Thursday. (Susan Walsh/AP)\n\n-- Michael Cohen plans on telling lawmakers that Trump repeatedly asked him about a skyscraper project in Moscow long after securing the Republican nomination, Reuters\u2019s Nathan Layne and Ginger Gibson report: \u201cCohen\u2019s assertion that Trump was inquiring about the project as late as June 2016, if true, would show Trump remained personally interested in a business venture in Russia well into his candidacy. Cohen, scheduled to report to prison in May, has already said he briefed Trump on the project in June 2016. ... In addition, Cohen will offer new information on Trump\u2019s financial statements that \u2018have never been produced before\u2019 relating to how Trump represented the values of his assets in financial transactions and other matters,\u201d according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\n-- Here are some other questions Cohen might answer during his testimony on Wednesday, as compiled by Matt Zapotosky and Rosalind S. Helderman:\n\nWho are the \u201cWhite House-based staff and legal counsel\u201d to Trump that Cohen remained in contact with, and what instruction did they give him about his testimony in Congress, in which he ultimately lied to lawmakers?\n\nDid Trump personally direct Cohen to lie, and did he tell that to the special counsel\u2019s office?\n\nDoes Cohen believe Trump obstructed any investigation, and does he have evidence to prove that?\n\nWas Cohen ever offered a pardon in exchange for being", "doc_id": "a28ace02-71d8-4bbe-b38c-4d8396cdd912", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5632dae6fbe29a3e7491935d5ca2d517805269e69d2f04268e4fa108d8cf955a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 19194, "end": 23095, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "6f7cba8b-4ace-4031-bef5-a666472f11fc", "2": "0a8556d7-dedd-4b56-bf60-11b5b97cf44d", "3": "2cd13eee-ac6d-4070-bd27-01d588e5001b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "2cd13eee-ac6d-4070-bd27-01d588e5001b": {"__data__": {"text": "prove that?\n\nWas Cohen ever offered a pardon in exchange for being silent?\n\nTo Cohen\u2019s knowledge, was Trump informed by his son Donald Trump Jr. or anyone else before his son took a meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016?\n\nDid Cohen discuss payments to Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels with other members of the Trump family? With other campaign officials?\n\nDoes Cohen believe that Trump or anyone associated with his campaign coordinated with a Russian effort to interfere in the U.S. election?\n\n-- House investigators are probing the president\u2019s contacts with then-acting attorney general Matt Whitaker after reports that Trump asked Whitaker whether U.S. attorney Geoffrey Berman could un-recuse himself to intervene in Cohen\u2019s case. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Rebecca Ballhaus and Dustin Volz report: \u201cThere is no sign Mr. Whitaker acted on any request from Mr. Trump \u2026 But the House Judiciary Committee is investigating whether Mr. Whitaker may have perjured himself in his appearance before the panel earlier this month, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Mr. Whitaker told the panel: \u2018At no time has the White House asked for nor have I provided any promises or commitments concerning the special counsel\u2019s investigation or any other investigation.\u2019 Any evidence that Mr. Trump sought to intervene in the federal prosecutors\u2019 probe could propel further lines of inquiry by lawmakers into whether he has tried to obstruct the investigation into his business dealings.\u201d\n\n-- The Trump Organization asked the House Judiciary Committee to stop investigating the company, accusing the panel of hiring a lawyer with a conflict of interest. John Wagner and Tom Hamburger report: \u201cIn a letter Monday to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), Trump Organization lawyer Alan S. Futerfas objected to the committee\u2019s hiring of Berry H. Berke on the grounds that his law firm, Kramer Levin, has represented the Trump Organization on an array of issues. \u2018This state of affairs violates recognized ethical obligations and irreparably taints the Committee\u2019s work,\u2019 Futerfas wrote \u2026 In a statement, Kramer Levin called the Trump Organization\u2019s letter to Nadler \u2018baseless\u2019 and said Berke\u2019s consulting work for the Judiciary Committee \u2018complies fully with all applicable ethical rules, does not pose any conflicts of interest and respects any obligations the firm may have.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Trump has asked his outside legal team to remain with him as investigations continue to unfold. The Daily Beast\u2019s Asawin Suebsaeng and Erin Banco report: \u201cThe president broached the topic of keeping his team together starting late last year, according to two sources familiar with the exchanges, by discussing other legal woes he might face after the Special Counsel\u2019s Office submits its report to the Department of Justice. Trump\u2019s focus at the time? The Southern District of New York. \u2026 Despite all the bustle surrounding the submission of a Mueller report, sources close to the president say Trump\u2019s legal team remains focused on pending matters in New York, as well as preparing for whatever other legal fallout could come stemming from Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.\u201d\n\n-- Washington\u2019s Prettyman Courthouse has become a public stage for the Mueller investigation. On days when Trump associates are questioned, more than a hundred people routinely line up to catch a glimpse of the action. Avi Selk reports: \u201cThe people came for Roger Stone\u2019s hearing, as they have been coming to other Trump confidant hearings in this building for months \u2014 sleuthing for clues, or awaiting grand jury smoke signals, or simply compelled to be proximate to what could be the most potent criminal case since Watergate. \u2026 There were people in matching blue suits, in sloganed sweatshirts and sneakers.

The White House denies it. Beth Reinhard and Alice Crites report: \u201cIn interviews and in the lawsuit, Alva Johnson said Trump grabbed her hand and leaned in to kiss her on the lips as he exited an RV outside the rally in Tampa on Aug. 24, 2016. Johnson said she turned her head and the unwanted kiss landed on the side of her mouth. In a statement, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders dismissed Johnson\u2019s allegation as \u2018absurd on its face.\u2019 \u2018This never happened and is directly contradicted by multiple highly credible eye witness accounts,\u2019 she wrote. Two Trump supporters that Johnson identified as witnesses \u2014 a campaign official and Pam Bondi, then the Florida attorney general \u2014 denied seeing the alleged kiss in interviews with The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cAs recently as May 2017, Johnson spoke glowingly of Trump in a radio interview. \u2018He is more incredible in person than I think you would even think as you see him on TV,\u2019 she told the Alabama-based program \u2018Politics and Moore.\u2019 \u2018He\u2019s just the nicest guy. \u2026 He treats everyone as if they are a part of his family.\u2019 She also said she expected to be given a job as the \u2018second-in-command\u2019 at the U.S. Embassy in Lisbon. \u2018I will at some point be heading over to Portugal to work in the embassy,\u2019 she said. The Post found the recording of the show after the first version of this story was published. One of Johnson\u2019s lawyers, Hassan Zavareei, said that at the time of the radio interview, she was bound by a nondisclosure agreement and was \u2018saying what she thought Trump and his supporters wanted.\u2019 \u2026\n\n\u201cJohnson said she told her boyfriend, mother and stepfather about the alleged kiss on the day that it occurred, an account all three confirmed to The Post. Two months later, Johnson consulted a Florida attorney; he gave The Post text messages showing that he considered her \u2018credible\u2019 but did not take her case for business reasons. The attorney gave Johnson the name of a therapist, whose notes, which The Post reviewed, reference an unspecified event during the campaign that had left her distraught. \u2026 Johnson, an event planner who lives in Madison County, Ala., is seeking unspecified damages for emotional pain and suffering. The federal lawsuit, filed Monday in Florida, also alleges that the campaign discriminated against Johnson, who is black, by paying her less than her white male counterparts. A campaign spokeswoman, Kayleigh McEnany, rejected that claim as \u2018off-base and unfounded.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- \u201cThe most legally significant aspect of Johnson\u2019s suit may ultimately be something the complaint does not explicitly address: the pervasive use of nondisclosure agreements by Trump during his campaign and in his Administration,\u201d Ronan Farrow adds in the New Yorker. \u201cJohnson\u2019s suit is at least the sixth legal case in which Trump campaign or Administration employees have defied their nondisclosure agreements. Three of those actions, including Johnson\u2019s, were filed this month. ...

The Daily Beast\u2019s Olivia Messer reports: \u201cZavareei said that Johnson watched\u2014and suffered\u2014with each national controversy, including when Trump enacted a policy of separating migrant children from their parents coming into the United States without documentation. \u2018It made her feel like she had some responsibility, having worked on his campaign,\u2019 said Zavareei.\u201d\n\nNeil Gorsuch whispers to Elena Kagan during an event last October at George Mason University\u2019s Antonin Scalia Law School. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nPOWER PLAYERS:\n\n-- Justice Elena Kagan could cast the deciding vote in one of the year\u2019s biggest cases: whether the Bladensburg Peace Cross dedicated to Marylanders killed in World War I stays or goes. Robert Barnes has a fun preview of oral arguments scheduled for tomorrow: \u201cKagan has emerged as one of the Supreme Court\u2019s most powerful voices on the separation of church and state, often rebuking conservative colleagues for allowing government actions that she says favor one religion over another. But the last time the justices considered the fate of a cross constructed on public land, Kagan was on the other side of the bench and on one side of the issue. As President Barack Obama\u2019s solicitor general, Kagan successfully defended a cross in the Mojave National Preserve, convincing the court\u2019s conservatives that what she unwaveringly referred to as a \u2018war memorial\u2019 should remain as a tribute to the sacrifice of World War I dead. \u2026\n\n\u201cOne of only four women to serve on the Supreme Court, Kagan is the least in the public eye. Although she is consistently on the court\u2019s left, she crosses over more often than the better-known Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor. But she is a favorite of those who follow and practice before the court. Lawyers who argue conservative causes say she is the justice most likely to probe the weak spots of their cases. And law professors across the ideological spectrum praise her clear and often colloquial writing style.\u201d\n\n-- Nikki Haley is launching a policy group as the former U.N. ambassador deflects questions about a potential 2024 presidential bid. Anne Gearan reports: \u201cShe insists she is not planning that far ahead, even as her range of activities suggest she is keeping her options open. \u2026 The organization\u2019s initial list of subjects reflects Haley\u2019s conservative worldview and political instincts, while its website features photographs of Haley traveling the world as U.N. ambassador and taking questions in the White House briefing room. The group\u2019s policy positions mostly align with Trump\u2019s, while also bearing echoes of traditional Republican views that have taken a back seat during the populist-flavored Trump era. She is tougher rhetorically on Russia than her former boss usually is and says she disagrees with Trump\u2019s preference for punitive tariffs as a negotiating tactic in trade disputes.\u201d\n\n-- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has undergone a transformation from Trump\u2019s virulent 2016 primary opponent to one of the president\u2019s biggest backers, isolating some of his colleagues in the process. Mark Leibovich (of \u201cThis Town\u201d fame) profiles Graham for Sunday\u2019s New York Times Magazine:\n\nGraham acknowledged he has cozied up to Trump to remain \u201crelevant\u201d ahead of his reelection bid next year: \u201c\u2018Well, O.K., from my point of view, if you know anything about me, it\u2019d be odd not to do this,\u2019 he said.

Felicia Sonmez reports: \u201cAll but three Democrats voted against a procedural motion on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, denying it the necessary 60 votes to proceed. \u2026 The bill includes criminal penalties, a right of civil action for an affected mother and a mandatory reporting requirement for other health providers.

Meagan Flynn reports: \u201cU.S. District Judge Dabney L. Friedrich found that the Firearms Policy Coalition and other groups did not put forth any convincing legal arguments in favor of stopping the Trump administration from carrying out the ban, which targets a device used in the 2017 Las Vegas massacre, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Friedrich, a 2017 appointee of President Trump to the District of Columbia, ruled it was \u2018reasonable\u2019 of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to conclude that a bump-stock, which uses the recoil energy from a rifle to automatically fire the next round, performs the same function as a machine gun and should therefore be banned just like machine guns under federal law.\u201d\n\n-- Several House Democrats requested information from the Pentagon on how it screens military recruits after service members were recently arrested in cases involving white supremacy. The lawmakers asked how these recruits were able to circumvent the military\u2019s checks with their extremist views, which they said posed a \u201csignificant concern, particularly given their combat and weapons training.\u201d (Dan Lamothe)\n\n-- A 24-year-old Honduran woman\u2019s pregnancy ended in a stillbirth while she was being held at an ICE detention center. Reis Thebault reports: \u201cThe woman ... was arrested near Hidalgo, Tex., on Feb. 18. She was six months pregnant at the time. Four days later, she went into labor and delivered a premature and unresponsive baby boy. Local doctors pronounced the newborn dead soon after. \u2026 ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection doesn\u2019t count stillbirths as in-custody deaths; rather, they\u2019re recorded in their own category, along with miscarriages. \u2026 The stillbirth will probably raise new questions about ICE\u2019s policy of detaining pregnant women, which changed from a \u2018presumption of release for all pregnant detainees\u2019 after an executive order from President Trump directed the agency \u2018to enforce the immigration laws of the United States against all removable aliens.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Border officials didn\u2019t receive guidance on the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy until after Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen enacted it.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will reportedly release 10 years of tax returns. (John Bazemore/AP)\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) announced she will not participate in a high-dollar fundraising program during her bid for the Democratic nomination. \u201cCandidates spend too much time with wealthy donors, and I\u2019ve made a decision to change that,\u201d she wrote in an email to supporters. \u201cThat means no fancy receptions or big money fundraisers only with people who can write the big checks. It means that wealthy donors won\u2019t be able to purchase better seats or one-on-one time with me at our events.\u201d\n\nReading between the lines: \u201cWarren has acknowledged in her fundraising emails that she hasn\u2019t achieved her online targets, a problem confirmed by a person familiar with her campaign\u2019s finances,\u201d Annie Linskey reports. \u201cThe move will provide Warren\u2019s camp with a ready-made excuse if her first-quarter fundraising totals are lower than expected. Those figures are released in mid-April and are traditionally seen as an early gauge of a candidate\u2019s strength. \u2026 Closing the door to high-dollar events will put even more pressure on her to come up with smaller contributions.\u201d\n\n-- Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he has already raised $10 million since announcing his bid last week. The New York Times\u2019s Shane Goldmacher reports: \u201cBut perhaps just as daunting a figure for his rivals is this: Nearly 39 percent of those donors used an email address that had never before been used to give to Mr. Sanders. For Mr. Sanders, the flood of money from fresh email addresses suggested to his team that he was dramatically expanding a donor network that had already dwarfed his 2020 competition.\u201d\n\n-- Bernie is also preparing to release 10 years of his tax returns, according to the National Journal\u2019s Hanna Trudo: \u201cThe display of personal financial transparency goes well beyond what the Vermont independent did during his 2016 presidential bid, when he failed to produce a comprehensive look at prior returns. \u2026 Sanders brought in roughly $1.75 million in book royalties across 2016 and 2017, on top of his $174,000 Senate salary. But he still ranks among the least wealthy senators, according to the most recent public data.\u201d\n\n-- During a CNN town hall last night, Sanders praised Trump for his willingness to meet with Kim. The senator also pledged to support the Democratic presidential candidate, no matter who it ends up being, and said that learning about allegations of sexual harassment within his campaign was very painful. He promised it \u201cwill not happen again.\u201d (CNN)\n\n-- Trump\u2019s former deputy campaign manager David Bossie is using a collection of endorsements from prominent Maryland Republicans for the president\u2019s reelection campaign to discourage Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) from a 2020 primary challenge. Jenna Johnson, Robert Costa and Arelis R. Hern\u00e1ndez report: \u201cBossie, who is one of two Republican National Committee representatives for Maryland, spoke at the Montgomery County GOP Convention on Saturday. There he met privately with allies of the president to discuss assembling a statement that would send a clear signal to Hogan (R) about Trump\u2019s support in the state as the governor mulls a 2020 bid \u2026 the statement, which is not yet finalized, is expected to express support for Hogan as governor while fully backing Trump in the 2020 presidential election. \u2026 Hogan criticized Bossie\u2019s attempt to divide Republicans in his state. \u2018These kind of heavy-handed tactics are not what we need in our politics. We should be focused on encouraging discussion and debate, not seeking to divide,\u2019 Hogan said.\u201d\n\n-- Hillary Clinton is not running in 2020, but her presence is still felt.

Kirsten Gillibrand. According to a Clinton strategist, she doesn\u2019t plan on endorsing a primary candidate but will support the eventual nominee.\n\n-- Democratic campaigns are grappling with whether they should pursue the Rust Belt states that Trump carried in 2016 or chase Sun Belt states trending purple. The Times\u2019s Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns report: \u201cThere is a growing school of thought that Democrats should not spend so much time, money and psychic energy tailoring their message to a heavily white, rural and blue-collar part of the country when their coalition is increasingly made up of racial minorities and suburbanites. \u2026 The dispute is not merely a tactical one \u2014 it goes to the heart of how Democrats envision themselves becoming a majority party. The question is whether that is accomplished through a focus on kitchen-table topics like health care and jobs, aimed at winning moderates and disaffected Trump voters, or by unapologetically elevating matters of race and identity, such as immigration, to mobilize young people and minorities with new fervor.\u201d\n\n-- On the other side of the aisle: Major GOP donors fear Trump will not be able to hold on to Rust Belt states in 2020. Politico\u2019s Anita Kumar and Maggie Severns report: \u201cLate last month, more than 100 major Republican donors gathered at the Trump International Hotel for a presentation from the president\u2019s campaign manager Brad Parscale and other top political hands on their plans to keep the White House in 2020 after a brutal midterm election. \u2026 According to two attendees, campaign officials acknowledged that Trump is under-performing in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, though they said he is holding steady in Florida and trending upward in Ohio. But they offered no details on what they`re doing to regain ground in the Midwest, the attendees said.\u201d\n\n-- Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is making an early play for the support of grass-roots groups in South Carolina. The State\u2019s Emma Dumain reports: \u201cIn interviews with nearly a dozen S.C. advocacy groups \u2014 many of them local chapters of national progressive organizations \u2014 representatives report they so far only have heard from the campaign of [Harris]. Harris\u2019 strategy has been to reach out to these groups early, long before anyone is prepared to offer an endorsement, in hopes of laying the groundwork for future support. \u2026 So far, the strategy is paying off. Activists in the traditionally conservative state are excited about being courted, listened to and valued.\u201d\n\n-- Former White House official Anthony Scaramucci said Trump would be worried if former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg runs for president. Scaramucci said Bloomberg is \u201cthe one that the president would be quietly worried about\u201d because he has the \u201cmental discipline\u201d to handle challenges posed by Trump. Bloomberg, a registered Democrat, hasn`t announced his intention to run yet, but fellow billionaire Warren Buffett already said he will support his bid.

Anne Gearan, Anthony Faiola and Carol Morello report: \u201cPence arrived in [Bogota, Colombia] to reiterate that Washington will not back away from diplomatic confrontation. His trip comes as some in the Venezuelan opposition have begun openly calling for the use of `force` to oust Maduro\u2019s socialist government.

Reis Thebault, Michael Brice-Saddler and Eli Rosenberg report: \u201cThe group was freed shortly after, said Daniel Coronell, Univision\u2019s president for news in the United States. Coronell said Venezuelan government officials confiscated the journalists\u2019 equipment. Ramos, in a phone interview with Univision after he was released, said the interview with Maduro lasted about 17 minutes. `He didn\u2019t like the things we were asking him about the lack of democracy in Venezuela, about torture, political prisoners, the humanitarian crisis that they were living,` he said. ... Ramos said the interview they recorded was also taken.\u201d\n\nThis is the video that Ramos said upset Maduro:\n\nEste es el video que @jorgeramosnews le mostr\u00f3 a Nicol\u00e1s Maduro y que lo molest\u00f3: venezolanos comiendo de un cami\u00f3n de basura. pic.twitter.com/u1Uodrp0GS \u2014 Univision Noticias (@UniNoticias) February 26, 2019\n\n-- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad made an unannounced visit to Iran to discuss U.S. policy with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani. From the AP\u2019s Nasser Karimi and Albert Aji: \u201cIran\u2019s semi-official Fars news agency said Khamenei told the visiting Assad that \u2018the buffer zone that Americans are after in Syria is among dangerous plots that should be rejected,\u2019 and that the U.S. plan to maintain a presence in Syria near the Iraqi border \u2018is another sample of their designs.\u2019 \u2026 Assad accused the U.S. and its regional allies like Saudi Arabia of creating rifts among various religious and ethnic groups in Syria, saying such efforts have backfired.\u201d\n\n-- Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif abruptly resigned, via Instagram. Erin Cunningham and Carol Morello report: \u201cThe move by Zarif, a well-liked diplomat both at home and abroad, could upend Iran\u2019s foreign policy at a critical time for the Islamic republic, which is suffering from renewed U.S. sanctions. \u2026 The reason for Zarif\u2019s resignation was not disclosed. Nor is it clear whether top Iranian officials will accept the resignation, and there were immediately conflicting reports about whether President Hassan Rouhani had already rejected it. \u2018He has handed in his resignation, but that doesn\u2019t mean that this is the end of this story,\u2019 said Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council in Washington. \u2026 Zarif\u2019s departure may be rooted in domestic issues, rather than foreign policy, because there are no significant prospects for negotiations on either Iran\u2019s nuclear program or on the issues of concern to Europeans and Americans.\u201d\n\n-- U.S. senators predict a vote on whether to end U.S. involvement in Yemen as soon as next week. From Reuters\u2019s Patricia Zengerle: \u201cOfficials from the U.S. State and Defense Departments met with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee behind closed doors on Monday to discuss the situation in Yemen, amid a months-long outcry in Congress about Saudi Arabia. \u2018I don\u2019t think they won any hearts and minds,\u2019 Democratic Senator Chris Murphy told reporters as he left the briefing.

The New York Times`s Chris Buckley reports: Xi \u201cabruptly summoned hundreds of officials to Beijing recently, forcing some to reschedule long-planned local assemblies. ... `Globally, sources of turmoil and points of risk are multiplying,` he told the gathering in January at the Central Party School. At home, he added, `the party is at risk from indolence, incompetence and of becoming divorced from the public.` ... There are no political challengers on the horizon who could pose an immediate threat to the Communist Party or Mr. Xi. But his remarks made clear that especially in 2019 \u2014 a year of politically sensitive anniversaries \u2014 the party would aggressively extinguish sparks that could ignite protests and turbulence.\u201d\n\n-- Also nervous? U.S. businessmen in China. According to a survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China, two-thirds of U.S. businesses in China have suffered as a result of the trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. But there`s still general support for the president`s approach to Beijing. Anna Fifield reports: \u201cTrump\u2019s constant exhortations for American businesses to move their operations back home, coupled with Chinese [Xi\u2019s] calls for `self reliance,` have only exacerbated business concerns about a protracted trade war leading to what is sometimes called economic `decoupling` \u2014 the world\u2019s two biggest economies trying to separate from each other... Still, the American companies generally felt that the pain would be worth it if the Trump administration could force China to make structural changes in its economy that would create better business conditions.\u201d\n\n-- The Post is launching a fellowship in honor of the paper\u2019s late contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi.

Alon Yakter and Mark Tessler explain why: \u201cGantz\u2019s centrist political party, Blue and White, leads the opposition despite being particularly vague on Israel\u2019s most important ideological cleavage: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In what has become something of a joke, Gantz has both stated that he would seek peace through compromise with the Palestinians and has run graphic ads boasting of the damage inflicted on Palestinians in Gaza during his time as head\u201d of the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nSen.

But school district organization in states such as Maryland and Virginia make funding more equitable. Laura Meckler reports: \u201cThe problem is worse in states where districts are small, cordoning off wealthy communities and limiting the likelihood that wealthier taxpayers will subsidize poorer students, said Rebecca Sibilia, EdBuild\u2019s chief executive. In states such as Maryland and Virginia, she said, many school districts are comprised of entire counties, making funding more equitable. In Maryland, 880,000 students are served by just 24 districts, vs. New Jersey, where 1.3 million students are divided between 540 districts.

Trump is intensifying the GOP\u2019s strength among older, blue-collar, and rural whites. But his style and agenda are simultaneously alienating younger and nonwhite voters, and straining the GOP\u2019s grip on college-educated whites, especially women.\n\nThe shift toward the GOP among older whites threatens the long-term position of Democrats in a wide array of states across the country\u2019s heartland, where those adults constitute a critical mass.\n\nIn this year\u2019s Senate contests, Democrats appear to have stabilized their position in several of the industrial states, with incumbents generally considered strong favorites for reelection in Michigan (Debbie Stabenow), Ohio (Sherrod Brown), and Pennsylvania (Bob Casey), along with a more equivocal favorite in Wisconsin (Tammy Baldwin). But the GOP\u2019s strength among older and blue-collar whites has still placed Republican challengers in a strong position to oust Democratic Senators Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota, Joe Donnelly in Indiana, Claire McCaskill in Missouri, and\u2014to a somewhat lesser extent\u2014Joe Manchin in West Virginia and Jon Tester in Montana. All of those are preponderantly white and heavily blue-collar states where Trump remains much more popular than he is nationally.\n\nThe resilience of industrial-state incumbents such as Brown, Stabenow, and Casey makes clear that Democrats aren\u2019t facing imminent extinction in the heartland; they are even well positioned to potentially recapture several governorships there this year. But the potential losses among the second group of senators, who are defending more rural states, underscore the likelihood that the Democratic position in the heartland will continue to erode over time, particularly as the GOP appeals more overtly to white anxiety over demographic and cultural change.\n\nAs that occurs, Democrats through the 2020s will need greater gains in the Sun Belt to fill the gap at every level\u2014in contests for the House, the Senate, and the Electoral College. Since 2008, Democrats have already brought into their camp two Sun Belt states that reliably leaned Republican through the early-21st century: Virginia and Colorado. New Mexico, a longtime swing state, has also tilted blue, with Clinton carrying it comfortably, Democrats holding both Senate seats, and Representative Michelle Lujan Grisham, the party\u2019s nominee, in a close contest to recapture the governorship.

E-5 Steven Acheson was assigned to the security detail of a high-ranking officer, driving a Humvee over IED-infested roads on more than 400 missions, as the violent insurgency tore the country apart.\n\nDuring his deployment, he suffered an accident that left him with a herniated disc. He had also begun experiencing symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\n\"Nightmares and strange things would happen in the middle of the night. I`d gouge the side of my face with my fingernails, and all kinds of interesting things were going on,\" Acheson, now 33, said.\n\nHis back injury went untreated, eventually requiring two surgeries. His doctors prescribed pain medication to help with his recovery.\n\n\"They just almost overnight filled me up with pills,\" Acheson said. \"I remember getting bags of pills mailed to my front door. I didn`t even have to leave my house to become a drug addict.\"\n\nHe left active duty in 2008 and began pursuing an engineering degree, transitioning to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health system. But Acheson said he found it \"almost impossible\" to function while taking OxyContin, a powerful opioid.\n\nSteven Acheson Steven Acheson\n\nThen he found something else that helped: marijuana. A friend on campus offered it to him, and it was like a \"lightswitch going off.\" Eventually he was able to stop taking pain pills entirely.\n\nBut medical marijuana was and remains illegal in his home state of Wisconsin, and even in the 33 states where it is legal, patients in the VA system don`t have access to it. The Food and Drug Administration classifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance, the same category as heroin and ecstasy. While VA doctors can discuss marijuana use with patients, they can`t recommend patients use it or help them obtain it.\n\nThe VA also won`t reimburse veterans if they obtain marijuana through other means. Acheson wants that changed, arguing the VA should consider medical marijuana no different than other forms of treatment veterans obtain through private providers.\n\n\"They do it already with acupuncture. They do it already with chiropractic work. They do it already with a number of things health care related that the VA just can`t provide. I don`t see any reason why on a state by state basis, we can`t be doing the same thing with cannabis,\" Acheson said.\n\nAcheson is now the co-founder and director of the group High Ground Veterans Advocacy, and co-founder of Wisconsin Veterans for Compassionate Care. He has also become an advocate for medical marijuana in Wisconsin, where the new Democratic governor supports medical marijuana legalization and decriminalization of small amounts for recreational use.\n\nOn the federal level, there are signs that support for expanding access to medical marijuana for veterans is growing. In February, Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Brian Schatz of Hawaii introduced the Veterans Medical Marijuana Safe Harbor Act to allow VA doctors to discuss and recommend medical marijuana to veterans in states where it is already legal.\n\nIn 2018, the group Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans for America (IAVA) surveyed 4,600 of its veteran members and found 55 percent of respondents said they want greater access to medical marijuana. Eighty-three percent said cannabis should be legal for medicinal purposes. About a quarter said they had used marijuana for medicinal purposes.\n\n\"Our veterans want access to the same care and options as their civilian counterparts. It is frustrating that the VA would prefer a world where those who have served their country have access to fewer treatment options than those who have not,\" IAVA CEO Jeremy Butler said in a statement.\n\nA need for more research\n\n\n\nAdvocates for expanding access to medicinal marijuana say allowing and supporting research into marijuana`s medicinal properties is just as important.

But there is a growing bipartisan push on Capitol Hill to expand studies into whether and how cannabis could be used by veterans to treat PTSD.\n\nIn January, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana and Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Arkansas introduced the VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act of 2019, which would direct the VA to perform clinical research on the safety and efficacy of medical marijuana in treating both PTSD and chronic pain. Reps. Lou Correa, a Democrat from California, and Clay Higgins, a Republican from Louisiana, filed identical legislation in the House.\n\nRep. Phil Roe, the top Republican on the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, also introduced his own bill directing the VA to research the drug.\n\n\"As a doctor myself, I am a firm believer in the importance of medical research to assure that a treatment is safe and effective,\" Roe said. \"If research on the usage of medical cannabis is favorable, I am confident that it could become another option to help improve the lives of veterans and other Americans.\"\n\nResearchers say they could be close to uncovering valuable information about the efficacy of cannabis to treat PTSD. Between 11 and 20 percent of veterans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan experience PTSD symptoms in a given year, according to the VA. PTSD is linked to other mental health issues like depression, and are at higher risk for drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nLast week, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies announced the completion of the first randomized controlled trial of \"whole plant\" marijuana used in treating PTSD. A total of 76 veterans took part in the study, smoking four different types of marijuana to test the effect on their symptoms. Dr. Sue Sisley, the study`s principal investigator, said data collected during the triple-blind study still needs to be analyzed, but said she hopes the results will be published in the coming months.\n\nAmong those awaiting the results is Dr. Marilyn Huestis, a member of the steering committee for the Lambert Center for the Study of Medicinal Cannabis and Hemp at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.\n\nHuestis, a former researcher at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said there is already evidence that medical marijuana can help with pain management. But plenty of questions remain about how and whether it can consistently help patients suffering from PTSD.\n\n\"We don`t have a lot of good choices for PTSD.

The official count was 304 to 227, according to an Associated Press tally of the electoral votes in every state.\n\nCHINA-TRADE\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe\u2019ve lost so much money with China \u2014 $500 billion a year. And on trade, it\u2019s such a disaster. It\u2019s $507 billion a year. China \u2014 just one country. We lose with everybody, almost. But China is one country \u2014 $507 billion, for many years.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: He\u2019s off by several hundred billion dollars on the trade deficit with China . Trump typically ignores one part of a trading relationship, services, and considers only the other part, goods. Even by that measure, he\u2019s wrong. On goods alone, the U.S. ran a trade deficit of $382 billion with China last year, not $507 billion. That was up from nearly $376 billion in 2017.\n\nThe U.S. is strong on services and ran a $40 billion surplus with China on that form of trade in 2017. So the actual trade deficit with China that year was $335 billon.\n\nHEALTH CARE\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe have some great private coverage. And we have initiated some incredible plans, like the new cooperative plan, where you get better insurance than Obamacare for a fraction of the cost.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: He\u2019s glossing over the limitations of his administration\u2019s expanded health care options , which involve both short term and association plans. They offer lower premiums than comprehensive plans such as those under the Affordable Care Act but cover less.\n\nShort-term plans don\u2019t have to take people with medical conditions or provide benefits such as coverage for maternity, mental health, prescription drugs and substance abuse treatment. Association health plans do have to accept people with pre-existing medical conditions, but they don\u2019t have to cover the full menu of 10 \u201cessential\u201d kinds of benefits required by Obamacare.\n\nGary Claxton of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation says short-term plans may turn out to be more costly than Trump administration officials suggest. The plans now cover up to 90 days, but if insurers expand them to offer up to 36 months\u2019 coverage, the companies will be taking on more risk. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to pay more up front because there\u2019s a longer time during which you could get sick,\u201d he said.\n\nMIDTERM ELECTIONS\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe were given no credit. I can\u2019t go and campaign for all of the people in the House. There\u2019s too many.\u201d\n\nTRUMP, on his endorsement of Florida candidate for governor, Ron DeSantis: \u201cI said, \u2018Ron, Don\u2019t make me do this, Ron.\u2019 \u2018Sir, I can win.\u2019 Alright, Ron, here we go. Because I know if he loses \u2014 which almost never happens when I endorse someone, almost never. Only one time, that was because it was done in the middle of the day of the election\u2026 But we very rarely lose.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump is wrong to suggest that almost every candidate he endorsed and campaigned for in the November midterm elections \u2014 except for perhaps one \u2014 won.\n\nTwo", "doc_id": "1b304d21-a410-4267-a34c-6ed9db3c13f9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "8422196c543f850196de5e312f22f037ff8826201038873e99a5c9d1ca45d4da", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3870, "end": 7581, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "365e7f54-afa5-4ae6-9284-2f06ec7077f7", "2": "39f370e5-2693-442e-af19-c87b688d9371", "3": "ab5692eb-cf6e-4170-9378-c730b8be08ad"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab5692eb-cf6e-4170-9378-c730b8be08ad": {"__data__": {"text": "for in the November midterm elections \u2014 except for perhaps one \u2014 won.\n\nTwo Republicans whom Trump strongly backed in their Senate races \u2014 Montana\u2019s Matt Rosendale and West Virginia\u2019s Patrick Morrisey \u2014 lost to Democratic Sens.

Dean Heller of Nevada and Leah Vukmir in Wisconsin.\n\nIn the House, Republican Rep. Jason Lewis lost his race in Minnesota to Democrat Angie Craig, whom he had defeated by 2 percentage points in 2016. Trump endorsed Lewis and campaigned for him.\n\nVETERANS\n\nTRUMP, on the Choice program for veterans: \u201cI got that approved after 44 years of being unable to get it approved for our veterans.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: False. Congress approved the private-sector Veterans Choice health program in 2014 and President Barack Obama signed it into law. Trump is expanding it .\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe are taking care of our veterans like they have never been taken care of before. We just got them Choice so they can now go see a doctor. Now they can go see a doctor instead of waiting on line for weeks and weeks and weeks.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Veterans still must wait for weeks.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true the VA recently announced plans to expand eligibility for veterans in the Veterans Choice program, it remains limited due in part to uncertain money and longer waits.\n\nThe program currently allows veterans to see doctors outside the VA system if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles to a VA facility. Under new rules to take effect in June, veterans will have that option for a private doctor if their VA wait is only 20 days (28 for specialty care) or their drive is only 30 minutes.\n\nBut the expanded Choice eligibility may do little to provide immediate help.\n\nThat\u2019s because veterans often must wait even longer for an appointment in the private sector. Last year, then-Secretary David Shulkin said VA care is \u201coften 40 percent better in terms of wait times\u201d compared with the private sector. In 2018, 34 percent of all VA appointments were with outside physicians, down from 36 percent in 2017.\n\nChoice came into effect after some veterans died while waiting months for appointments at the Phoenix VA medical center.\n\nSHUTDOWN\n\nTRUMP: \u201cI flew to Iraq \u2014 the first time I left the White House, because I stayed at the White House for months and months because I wanted the Democrats to get back from their vacations from Hawaii and these other places.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump actually left the White House plenty of times during the \u201cmonths and months\u201d surrounding the partial government shutdown that began Dec. 22.\n\nBesides his trip to Iraq and Germany on Dec. 26-27, Trump traveled to the Mexican border town of McAllen, Texas, on Jan. 10. On Jan. 14, he also went to New Orleans to address the American Farm Bureau. He\u2019s left the White House during the five-week shutdown for meetings at Camp David and the Capitol.\n\nShortly before the shutdown began, he traveled to Philadelphia to watch the Army-Navy football game (Dec. 8), visited Kansas City for a law enforcement conference (Dec. 7), attended former President George H.W. Bush\u2019s funeral at the Washington National Cathedral (Dec. 5), participated in the G-20 summit in Argentina in late November; and hosted \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rallies in Mississippi with Senate candidate Cindy Hyde-Smith (Nov. 26). He hosted a dinner on Thanksgiving at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nAssociated Press writers Eric Tucker and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed to this report.

(AP) \u2014 Deanna Miller Berry doesn\u2019t often see presidential candidates. So when New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker recently came to Bamberg County, South Carolina, she was primed to unload about a contaminated water system.\n\n\u201cWhat is your plan to fix it?\u201d Berry asked, her eyes narrowed.\n\nBooker, former mayor of Newark, the largest city in the most densely populated state, assured Berry he cares about the 3,000 residents of Denmark, South Carolina. \u201cThis is a time in America where too many people are feeling left out, left behind, not included,\u201d he said, promising \u201ca massive infrastructure investment\u201d targeting \u201cforgotten\u201d places.\n\nThe exchange highlights the effort by Democratic presidential candidates to make inroads in rural America. With the first contests unfolding next year in South Carolina, Iowa and New Hampshire, small-town voters will play a critical role in choosing the next Democratic nominee. And the early attention could help the eventual nominee be more conversant on rural issues and compete for votes in places that gave President Donald Trump his most intense support in 2016.\n\n\u201cOrganizing in every precinct is the key to winning both the caucus and the general election in Iowa,\u201d Iowa Democratic Chairman Troy Price said.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders lamented rural decline during an Iowa swing this weekend.\n\n\u201cAll over America, we have tragically seen more and more young people leave the small towns they grew up in, the small towns they love, because there are no decent-paying jobs in those towns \u2014 we intend to change that,\u201d Sanders said, drawing cheers at the Iowa State Fairgrounds.\n\nAt the same time, California Sen. Kamala Harris was in small-town South Carolina advocating more spending on telemedicine, broadband internet and infrastructure. Booker used his two-day rural swing last month to talk health care, housing, infrastructure and criminal justice, among other issues. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand was the first candidate who ventured to rural northern New Hampshire. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar has already visited a tiny town in Wisconsin, which will be a general election battleground.\n\nSeveral candidates plan to attend a March 30 rural issues forum at Buena Vista University in Storm Lake, Iowa \u2014 population 10,600.\n\nThe approach matters most immediately because the delegates necessary to become the nominee are awarded in part from primary and caucus results in individual congressional districts, even the most rural and Republican-leaning. But investing there also could narrow Republicans\u2019 general election margins, by increasing turnout among Democratic-friendly constituencies like rural black and Latino voters or peeling off white voters or both.\n\nThat could flip states like Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina \u2014 even Florida \u2014 that propelled Trump to an Electoral College majority. Besides helping win the presidency, rural gains would be necessary for Democrats to have the muscle on Capitol Hill to enact the kinds of sweeping policy changes they are advocating on many fronts.\n\n\u201cSo much of this is about the margins,\u201d Iowa\u2019s Price said.\n\nBeyond the politics, candidates say rural outreach is required of anyone who wants to govern a diverse nation.\n\n\u201cFolks want to be seen,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThey want their issues to be heard. ... They could care less about half the stuff that gets covered on cable news networks.\u201d\n\nIn Wisconsin, Klobuchar said, it\u2019s \u201cabout knowing the issues that matter to people whether they\u2019re Democrats, Republicans and independents \u2014 and in rural areas it\u2019s not just about the farm bill.\u201d\n\nThe 2018 midterms demonstrated Democrats\u2019 tough realities beyond metro areas, but still offered some bright spots.\n\nAP VoteCast, a national survey of more than 115,000 voters, found rural and small-town residents cast 35 percent of midterm ballots; 56 percent of those voted for Republican House candidates, compared to 41 percent for Democrats.

Some winners establish a personal brand at odds with the national party \u2014 West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin defending the coal industry, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown opposing much of U.S. trade policy, Montana Sen. Jon Tester playing up his rancher credentials.\n\nBut that won\u2019t necessarily work for a presidential candidate looking to become the face of a party with a decidedly liberal base. None of the declared candidates deviates from Democratic orthodoxy supporting abortion rights and LGBTQ civil rights and opposing Trump\u2019s hard line on immigration \u2014 all positions that run afoul of rural and small-town voters who collectively are more culturally conservative than urban dwellers.\n\nSanders struggled with that balance in 2016 when Hillary Clinton hammered him for some Senate votes against gun measures that most Democrats backed. Sanders noted that many Vermonters, as in the rest of rural America, view guns differently than most big-city residents, but Clinton successfully used the issue against Sanders, particularly with black women.\n\nWould-be Democratic presidents are left to mix economic arguments with biography.\n\nWashington Gov.

Sanders, who still speaks with his native Brooklyn inflection, drew roars in Iowa when mentioned using antitrust law to limit corporate power.\n\nHarris notes that California \u2014 caricatured in Middle America as a bastion of coastal liberalism \u2014 has the nation\u2019s biggest agricultural output. And in South Carolina, she said she heard a lot about jobs and state Republicans\u2019 refusal to expand Medicaid insurance.\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren notes that long before her Harvard law career, she was a child in Norman, Oklahoma, where her family\u2019s working-class struggles shaped her liberal approach to consumer, labor and finance law.\n\nAfter hearing Booker, Kenneth Belton, a 63-year-old resident of struggling Fairfield County, South Carolina, said a president doesn\u2019t have to come from his walk of life.

(Photo: Marc Lester/Anchorage Daily News via AP)\n\nAnchorage: Nelson Angapak Sr. promised Sen. Ted Stevens to help Alaska Native veterans get another chance to apply for prized land allotments. It took two decades, but the 74-year-old Yup\u2019ik leader has done it \u2013 with help from others, he points out. Congress passed a major lands bill in March that opens the door for more Native veterans to apply for tracts of land of up to 160 acres. It follows a more limited application period in 1998, an opportunity many veterans said wasn\u2019t enough. The allotments were offered to Alaska Natives by the federal government beginning in 1906, after non-Native settlers and miners began arriving in the state and claiming Native lands. The program\u2019s original restrictions prevented many from applying until the 1960s, says Kevin Illingworth, professor of tribal management at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The program ended in 1971, before many of the Natives in the military returned to Alaska from service in Vietnam.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A border activist charged with helping a pair of migrants with water, food and lodging is set to go on trial in U.S. court.

The Denver Post reported Monday that professor Terrance Boult set up a long-range surveillance camera in an office window at the Colorado Springs campus. It captured more than 16,000 images of passersby during the spring semesters of 2012 and 2013. Boult says the images were collected to create a dataset as part of an effort to enhance facial recognition technology. The dataset was made publicly available online in 2016, but it was taken down in April. Boult says he waited five years to release the dataset online to protect student privacy. University spokesman Jared Verner says a panel reviewed the research protocol for the project.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov.

The Democratic governor signed the law at the Parkville Care Center in Hartford. He said the increases will help lift workers out of poverty, reduce pay disparities among races and genders, and stimulate the state\u2019s economy. An estimated 130,000 workers are expected to benefit from the first increase planned for October, when the minimum wage will climb to $11 an hour.

(Photo: Courtesy of Naples Zoo at Caribbean Gardens)\n\nNaples: The Naples Zoo is celebrating the birth of three African lion cubs. The zoo announced the birth of the cubs \u2013 the institution\u2019s first in 30 years \u2013 on Thursday; one was born May 13, and two were born May 14. The cubs and their mother, 13-year-old Shani, may be exhibited late this summer. The zoo says it will host a contest to name the cubs. It says zoo workers haven\u2019t gotten close enough to the cubs to know their genders or weights, but the cubs are being monitored through video feeds. The International Union for Conservation of Nature classifies African lions as vulnerable to extinction. They\u2019re endangered by illegal hunting, declining prey populations and habitat loss.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: More than a third of small towns in the state lost population in the past year, highlighting the challenges of reviving rural areas. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports new census estimates show that Camilla fell below 5,000 residents. Sparks fell below 2,000, Fort Gaines dropped below 1,000, and Milan fell to 661 residents, for a loss of 7% of its population. All four towns are in South Georgia. Meanwhile, Georgia\u2019s cities are growing. Atlanta grew more than 1% in the past year and is now nearing the half-million-resident mark. The city now boasts 498,044 residents and will cross 500,000 next year if current growth rates continue. The trend is hardly a new one, but continued population losses have raised questions about whether rural areas can do anything to reverse the tide.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Big waves and high tides in the state will make shoreline erosion and flooding likely this summer. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports a University of Hawaii at Manoa geologist has predicted a \u201cregional anomaly\u201d is likely to produce tides 2-4 inches higher than levels noted on charts. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says there will be 36 days with peak high tides above 2.2 feet in June, July and August. Geologist Dolan Eversole, who works with the Waikiki Beach Special Improvement District, says the highest tide will be 2.6 feet on July 31. Eversole says that an anomaly involving cyclical high water levels and Pacific winds will cause levels higher than those predicted by NOAA and that, combined with big waves, these high tides make shoreline inundations and erosion likely.\n\nIdaho\n\nCaldwell: Twelve farm workers and ten others were treated at the West Valley Medical Center and decontaminated by a hazmat team Sunday night. KTVB-TV reports the Caldwell Fire Department said the workers were exposed to an unknown substance at a field near Wilder in eastern Idaho, and all began to experience flu-like symptoms. They then all went to the medical center for treatment. Caldwell Fire treated the first patient and then requested help by the State Office of Emergency Management, which sent the Region 3 Hazmat Team to help decontaminate the other patients. Officials did not release what the substance was to which the workers were exposed or why another ten people had to be treated and decontaminated at the hospital.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The University of Chicago says it will be the first U.S. university to create a school of molecular engineering, thanks to a $100 million donation.

(Photo: Courtesy of Grissom Air Museum)\n\nBunker Hill: The aircraft museum at northern Indiana\u2019s Grissom Air Reserve Base is working to raise $300,000 toward a building to protect and display one of the few surviving Cold War-era B-58 Hustler bombers. Grissom Air Museum leaders plan an exhibit space resembling one of the huts that housed the bombers when they were stationed at the base in the 1960s. The B-58 was the U.S. Air Force\u2019s first operational supersonic bomber. Museum Director Tom Jennings tells the Kokomo Tribune the B-58 is the museum\u2019s crown jewel. The museum raised about $90,000 during a reunion of B-58 veterans and hopes to start construction later this year. Museum officials say nearly half of the 116-aircraft fleet was stationed at what is now Grissom, and only eight such planes remain.\n\nIowa\n\nAnkeny: A food festival this weekend offers the chance ton enjoy pizza for seven solid hours. Ankeny\u2019s fourth annual Pizza Fest is taking place from 4 to 11 p.m. Saturday at the new Town Square Park near The District in Ankeny\u2019s Prairie Trail. Festivalgoers can taste pizza and other foods from area pizzerias, restaurants and food truck vendors. Domestic and local craft beers, wine and specialty cocktails will also be available along with games and live music. Admission is free. Pizza lovers can enter an eating contest, and vendors will be vying for votes to be named the Best of the Fest 2019. Attendees can try each food vendor\u2019s entry for $1. Along with pizza, entries will include pizza corn dogs, pizza-dillas, pizza mac and cheese, pizza egg rolls and other tasty pizza creations.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Tiger and lion pelts seized from wildlife traffickers have been donated to zoos in Topeka and Wichita. U.S. Attorney Stephen McAllister said Friday that his office donated pelts that were seized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service during investigations of a black market for hides and other parts of protected wildlife. Many of the wildlife items forfeited or abandoned during federal investigations are donated to educational facilities and nonprofit organizations to teach about endangered species. Fish and Wildlife Service agents used some of the pelts in a sting operation in 2018 that resulted in a Wichita man pleading guilty and agreeing to pay $8,000 for two tiger pelts. Agents seized a lion pelt from his home.\n\nKentucky\n\nRichmond: The destruction of chemical weapons stored in the state since the 1940s is set to begin. The Lexington Herald-Leader reports that destruction of chemical agents including mustard, sarin and VX will begin in June after decades of planning and preparations. The weapons are stored at the Blue Grass Army Depot in Richmond, and a company called Blue Grass Chemical Activity is responsible for their destruction. The Blue Grass Army Depot and Blue Grass Chemical Activity say about 1,200 workers are set to eliminate more than 100,000 chemical-filled munitions stored in earth-covered igloos by 2023.

(Photo: New Orleans CVB)\n\nNew Orleans: The French government has added a house in the city where the French painter Edgar Degas lived briefly to a network of houses of famous French people. Degas House Museum owner David Villarrubia says the bed and breakfast will be able to display a large red medallion showing it is part of the \u201cMaisons des Illustres.\u201d Degas visited relatives there for 4 1/ 2 months in 1872-73. Villarrubia says he was notified late last year and expects the medallion in July. He says the network includes 236 houses, but only four are outside of France and its territories, with only one other in the United States. France\u2019s Ministry of Culture created the designation in 2011 to encourage people to visit homes representing French history and culture.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state is on track to come up with a plan to become a net exporter of energy by 2030. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills recently signed the bill into law as part of efforts to promote renewable energy. Democratic Rep. Brian Hubbell has said renewable energy such as hydropower, wind and biomass already makes up 36% of Maine\u2019s total energy usage. Federal data shows imported carbon fuels produce 90 of the 120 terawatt-hours of energy that Maine consumes each year. The legislation directs the Governor\u2019s Energy Office to analyze how the state can become a net exporter of energy by 2030. The state could do that by developing and expanding its energy generating capacity, energy conservation and energy efficiency efforts at a level to offset Maine\u2019s domestic energy consumption.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The speaker of the House of Delegates has called for the removal of a Statehouse plaque that honors the Civil War\u2019s Union and Confederate soldiers. Speaker Adrienne A. Jones said last week that the plaque \u201csympathizes with Confederate motivations and memorializes Confederate soldiers.\u201d The Democrat shared her concerns in a letter to the State House Trust, which oversees alterations to the Capitol building. The Baltimore Sun reports that the plaque features the American flag and the Confederate flag crossed over the words, \u201cMaryland Remembers.\u201d The plaque says its purpose is to ensure that Maryland remembers the \u201cnearly 63,000 native sons who served in the Union forces and the more than 22,000 in those of the Confederacy.\u201d Jones sits on the State House Trust, which would need to approve the plaque\u2019s removal.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nThe birthplace of John F. Kennedy in Brookline, Mass., has been a museum for 50 years. (Photo: National Park Service, John Fitzgerald Kennedy National Historic Site)\n\nBrookline: The National Park Service is marking two Kennedy milestones this week. On Wednesday, events are planned to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the opening of the John Fitzgerald Kennedy National Historic Site at JFK\u2019s boyhood home in Brookline. That same day would have been the slain president\u2019s 102nd birthday. Organizers say a special commemoration will be held starting at 10 a.m. with the theme, \u201cWhat JFK means to me.\u201d At 2 p.m., presidential biographers Fredrik Logevall, David Nasaw and Barbara Perry will participate in a panel discussion examining the legacy of the nation\u2019s 35th president. The park service leads tours of the house where the Kennedy family began its rise to national prominence. Kennedy was assassinated Nov. 22, 1963.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park in western Michigan has opened a new attraction \u2013 on the roof.

Dave Neitzel, an epidemiologist with the Minnesota Department of Health, told Minneapolis Public Radio that the cold kills ticks only if the insects are exposed to the air. He says the ticks mostly survived the harsh cold by staying insulated under a thick blanket of snow. Early results from health department field surveys indicate there are more deer ticks now compared to this time last year. Deer ticks carry Lyme disease, which causes fever and fatigue, joint damage and, if left untreated, heart and neurological problems. Neitzel urges outdoor enthusiasts to protect themselves with repellents containing DEET or permethrin.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: The National Park Service is considering dismantling some historic buildings in the state because nobody has been willing to lease or restore them. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports the nine cottages and two outbuildings are in the Tupelo Homestead Historic District. Built in 1936 by the Resettlement Administration and transferred to the National Park Service in 1940, they are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Four years ago, Natchez Trace Parkway officials tried to gauge public and private interest in preserving some of the cottages that sit near its headquarters. Last year, the parkway sought proposals but received none. A news release says the parkway cannot afford to maintain the buildings. The colony of cottages originally had 35 homesteads.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The St. Louis Zoo is planning an $11.5 million expansion of its area for primates, adding 35,000 square feet of outdoor space that will include trails and tunnels for observers to get a close-up view. Monkeys, chimps and their cousins have long been among the most popular of the 17,000 animals at the zoo, even if the Primate House where they live is aging. Curator of primates Heidi Hellmuth says the new Primate Canopy Trails, expected to open in 2021, allows the animals to spend much of their time outside. Meanwhile, visitors will be able to get remarkably close. Those entering the primate area will walk through a ground-level glass tunnel. Overhead mesh tunnels between existing sycamore trees will let people observe the animals as they move and play.\n\nMontana\n\nAnaconda: The state\u2019s congressional delegation is protesting the planned closure of an Anaconda Job Corps center by the U.S. Department of Labor. The Montana Standard reports that the Anaconda Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center will close in August. The center opened in 1966 and provides training in manufacturing, mechanics, carpentry and other disciplines. The department says it plans to close nine centers across the country to better serve students at higher-performing centers. Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, Republican U.S. Sen. Steve Daines and GOP Rep. Greg Gianforte are urging Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta to reconsider the decision. Bill Everett, the Anaconda center\u2019s CEO, says it\u2019s one of Anaconda\u2019s biggest employers and keeps many youth out of trouble by providing them with vital job skills and employment opportunities.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Just as", "doc_id": "538dc72b-2a9b-47c9-8dce-545e15785ad2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "57ae13f95ff2a319dd6f364bd9e547c2e5e541dc97033c537d9455bbf2c04894", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 19650, "end": 23532, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "5e52aa27-a9bf-4f78-acff-e16356d88fac", "2": "d58ee1d3-ab75-4687-9ac4-585104f8d76b", "3": "3c946933-3538-4dbe-a3ba-a559da8d82f1"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c946933-3538-4dbe-a3ba-a559da8d82f1": {"__data__": {"text": "skills and employment opportunities.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Just as summer is finally coming into view, a local museum is kicking off its search for the perfect Christmas tree. The Durham Museum is searching for the official tree for its annual Christmas at Union Station celebration. Every year, the museum receives submissions from Omaha-area residents offering to donate their evergreen tree for display. The tree selected must meet certain benchmarks, including that it be over 40 feet tall, have a single, straight trunk, have a uniform shape and be in a spot where it can be safely removed. This year\u2019s tree will be cut down on Nov. 18, and a tree-lighting ceremony is set for Nov. 29.

(Photo: AP)\n\nBaker: A 137-year-old rifle found five years ago leaning against a juniper tree in Great Basin National Park is now part of an exhibit dedicated to the \u201cForgotten Winchester\u201d at the park visitor center, in Nevada near the Utah border. The weathered Winchester Model 1873 is in a case designed to capture the way it looked when park archaeologist Eva Jensen stumbled across it on a rocky outcrop above Strawberry Creek during an archaeological survey. Based on its condition, experts believe the weapon might have been abandoned in the forest more than a century ago. But nearly five years after its discovery, park officials still don\u2019t know to whom it belonged or why it was left against the tree. The exhibit also highlights the role the Model 1873 \u2013 one of the most popular guns on the Western frontier \u2013 played in the history of the West.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state\u2019s Fish and Game Department is reminding people not to interfere if they see fawns by themselves. The majority of deer fawns are born in May and June. People may see fawns alone and try to help them, but the doe usually isn\u2019t far off, waiting to return to feed her newborn offspring. The department says adult deer can be easily detected by predators, due to their scent and size. Does will spend extended periods away from their fawns to disassociate their scent from the fawn and keep them safe from predators. People who try to help usually are removing fawns from the mother\u2019s care. Improper care of injured or orphaned wildlife often leads to animals\u2019 sickness or death. People can call in a report if there\u2019s a concern.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Several months after a false start, the state has issued new rules for microbreweries. The guidelines released Tuesday cover how many events breweries can host, who is allowed to drink on-premises and whether they can serve food. Last fall, the state issued rules that prompted opposition from some microbrewery owners who said they would hurt business, so the state\u2019s Division of Alcohol and Beverage Control decided to suspend the process and do more study. The guidelines are updates to a 2012 law that allowed breweries to serve their products on-site. Bar and restaurant owners have voiced concern that the breweries are diluting the value of their liquor licenses, which are limited in number and can cost well into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nShiprock: Ranchers in northwestern New Mexico suspect toxic plants are responsible for the recent deaths of more than a dozen cows. The Gallup Independent reports at least 15 cows from different herds in the Shiprock area have died of a mysterious illness in the past three weeks. And ranchers say the purple plant known as the tall mountain larkspur is the likely cause. The plant is growing in abundance on the range thanks to unusually wet weather. It is used in Navajo and Hopi religious ceremonies and as after-birth wash.

Jonah Reider became a media sensation as a Columbia University senior booted from his dorm for running a sophisticated supper club there. His club, Pith, now has a new incarnation in a high-rise apartment near Wall Street. Reider flew overseas this spring to make a pilot for Japanese television. And he\u2019s planning a grilled cheese sandwich shop in Tokyo. He\u2019s also launched a company that sells honey, salt and olive oil infused with CBD nationally, as well as with THC in Oregon. Despite all that, Reider says he doesn\u2019t want to be known as a chef. He tells the Associated Press he\u2019s trying to inspire people to cook at home for friends and family rather than overspending at restaurants.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDurham resident Poet Williams, 28, speaks at a press conference in Raleigh, N.C., about the \u201cSecond Chance Act,\u201d which would give more people in the state a chance to expunge their criminal records. (Photo: Amanda Morris/AP)\n\nRaleigh: Every time 28-year-old Poet Williams applies for a job, his arrest record comes up: three nonviolent misdemeanors. Those drug charges have followed the Durham resident since he was 21, barring him from jobs, apartments and opportunities. Soon, however, he may be able to remove those offenses from his record. The state Senate recently passed legislation loosening the requirements to expunge a criminal record. Offenders could wipe out multiple nonviolent misdemeanor or low-level felony convictions, regardless of age, and the bill expands expunctions for misdemeanors and minor felonies committed by 16- and 17-year olds. Currently, only nonviolent, first-time convictions qualify. Crimes that require sex offense registration and traffic infractions couldn\u2019t be expunged. \u201cThe Second Chance Act\u201d measure now goes to the House, where organizers say it stands a good chance of passing.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum\u2019s office says nearly 70 people have applied to serve on a panel that\u2019s seen as key to implementing a voter-approved constitutional amendment aimed at government ethics reform. Those who submitted applications by Friday\u2019s deadline include several former lawmakers, lobbyists, farmers, tribal members, a Boy Scout leader and a newspaper editor. The Republican-led Legislature was successful in pushing its own bill aimed at ethics reform to meet the requirements of the constitutional amendment. But it wasn\u2019t what Democrats and others who pushed for the ethics reform wanted. The constitutional amendment still allows the new commission to write its own rules for ethics reform. The governor, as well as Senate majority and minority leaders, must agree by consensus on who sits on the panel, which is expected to be chosen by July 1.\n\nOhio\n\n\u201cPillars,\u201d by King Features editorial cartoonist Jimmy Margulies, is among the political cartoons in a new exhibit at the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum in Columbus, Ohio.

Museum founder Lucy Caswell co-curated the exhibit with Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes. \u201cFront Line: Editorial Cartoonists and the First Amendment\u201d runs through October.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state attorney general\u2019s office says the state Supreme Court should reject a proposed petition to expand Medicaid because the summary contradicts the body of the petition concerning income eligibility for the public health insurance program. The petition was filed on behalf of two residents in April. It would modify Oklahoma\u2019s constitution to extend the federal-state health insurance program to eligible low-income adults. The Oklahoman reports that the attorney general\u2019s office said in a court briefing Thursday that the proposed petition is otherwise constitutional. The petition\u2019s supporters also filed a brief with the court Thursday insisting that the Supreme Court maintain the petition\u2019s language and its constitutionality. The Oklahoma Supreme Court is slated to hear the case\u2019s oral arguments June 18.\n\nOregon\n\nMount Jefferson is among the stunning views hikers can find on the Whitewater Trail. (Photo: Zach Urness / Statesman Journal file))\n\nSalem: One of the state\u2019s most popular wilderness trails will remain closed into the beginning of this summer, almost two years after a large wildfire closed it down in the Mount Jefferson Wilderness. The Whitewater Trail, the most common route to the popular backcountry campsites of Jefferson Park, had its closure order extended into August, the U.S. Forest Service said last week. The trail was heavily damaged by the Whitewater Fire that burned in July 2017. Crews worked last summer and fall to fix the trail, but more trees died over the winter and spring, leaving a mess on the road and at the trailhead. Detroit district ranger David Halemeier says crews need additional time to clean out the area before reopening it to the public.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nActor Jeffrey Carpenter, portraying King Lear, performs in the Quantum Theatre\u2019s production of Shakespeare\u2019s darkest tragedy. (Photo: Keith Srakocic/AP)\n\nPittsburgh: A local theater company is bringing Shakespeare to the site of a once-mighty steel company\u2019s blast furnace. Quantum Theatre is using the backdrop of the Carrie Furnace for its production of \u201cKing Lear,\u201d the bard\u2019s darkest tragedy. It tells of grief and madness, family values gone wrong and a powerful king brought low. The theater company\u2019s artistic director and founder says being at the site gives a sense of the enormity of the steel industry and the enormity of its collapse. Karla Boos says those are wonderful metaphors for \u201cKing Lear.\u201d The Carrie Furnaces are the last remaining structures of what was once the thrumming heart of the Homestead Steel Works. The company produced steel used in the Empire State Building, the Brooklyn Bridge and other iconic structures. The play runs through Sunday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Many items in the state archives, including Rhode Island\u2019s copy of the Bill of Rights, are at risk of damage because they\u2019re kept in a building that\u2019s not meant for preserving rare, historic documents, according to an assessment released Tuesday. There isn\u2019t enough space to store or exhibit them properly, and water, light, dust and atmospheric pollution pose a risk to many of the items, according to the report by the Northeast Document Conservation Center. The collection has been housed since 1990 in a rented office building in a flood zone in downtown Providence. An estimated 35% of the collection should be considered a high priority for conservation, the center found.

The state Department of Transportation says the heat caused the steel in the Ben Sawyer Bridge to Sullivans Island to expand, preventing the bridge from fully closing after it was opened Monday. The DOT said on Twitter that crews cooled the steel with water from a firetruck, then locked the bridge once it could close. Transportation officials say they will keep the bridge locked until they can fix the steel, giving it more room to expand. The closing left only one way on and off Sullivans Island and the Isle of Palms at the end of the Memorial Day weekend. The high Sunday and Monday in Charleston was 100 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBrookings: A Brookings High School student has captured the first-place award in an international science competition for his project aimed at fighting the opioid epidemic. Fourteen-year-old Aditya Tummala developed a gummy-like substance, similar to a gummy bear, that would make an opioid pill tamper-proof, meaning the medication couldn\u2019t be crushed or melted for snorting or injecting. KSFY-TV says the project garnered first place at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in Phoenix, Arizona. Tummala calls the product Tampr-X.\n\nTennessee\n\nOriginal Goner Records artists Guitar Wolf will play the label`s 25th anniversary celebration this weekend. (Photo: Hitomi Katada)\n\nMemphis: Back in 1993, when Eric Friedl decided to start the Goner Records label \u2013 putting out a limited vinyl release from Japanese noise-rockers Guitar Wolf \u2013 he did it because \u201ctheir music was so wild that I didn\u2019t think there was a label that would dare release anything by them.\u201d Back then, Friedl couldn\u2019t have expected Goner would be going, bigger and better than ever, 25 years on. But in 2019, Goner is its own little empire: one that includes a still-flourishing label, a thriving retail store and the annual Gonerfest concert extravaganza, which draws bands and fans from all over the world each September. To mark Goner\u2019s silver anniversary, the company is throwing a party this weekend. Goner25 is a three-day bash that will include a performance by Guitar Wolf and other longtime label acts and supporters like The 5.6.7.8\u2019s, Royal Pendletons, Jack Oblivian and Bloodshot Bill, plus film screenings and other fun.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A new study says housing sales in the state would decline, gasoline prices would spike and the state\u2019s economic output would drop by hundreds of billions of dollars if another major storm struck an unprotected coastline. The joint economic impact study by Texas A&M University at Galveston and the Texas General Land Office evaluated storm surge impacts on the three counties along Galveston Bay \u2013 Galveston, Harris and Chambers. The Houston Chronicle reports it also examined how flooding from a major storm would affect local and national economies. Hurricane Harvey swamped the area in August 2017, making landfall near Corpus Christi with 130 mph sustained winds and torrential rains. The study was conducted before the Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 October proposal for a 74-mile barrier to avert future hurricanes.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Becoming one of the 10 approved medical marijuana growers in the state\u2019s new program won\u2019t be cheap.

The 2019 Point-in-Time Count Report was released this month by the Vermont Coalition to End Homelessness and the Chittenden County Homeless Alliance. The survey, which was conducted Jan. 23, found that 1,089 Vermonters were homeless that day. That represented a decrease of 202 people from the 2018 count. The Point-in-Time Count allows local communities and state policy makers to understand the current problems of homelessness, target limited funding to appropriate housing and services, and track progress in reducing homelessness. Among other findings, the survey determined that 245 homeless people were under age 18, the same percentage as 2018.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: Inflatable rafts, trashed awnings, red cups and towels amounted to 10 tons of garbage left on the shore at Chic\u2019s Beach following a Memorial Day weekend event. Floatopia, a massive start-of-summer party at Chic\u2019s Beach, drew hundreds of people Sunday for a day of drinking and lounging in the Chesapeake Bay, WCNC-TV reports, but photos of the messy aftermath spread quickly online. A crew of only nine people arrived Monday morning to clean up the 20,000-pound mess, Virginia Beach Public Works spokesman Drew Lankford said. \u201cIt was food wrappers, cans, bottles, pieces of floats, towels, everything,\u201d he told WCNC-TV. Lankford told WCNC-TV that Floatopia is organized largely on social media, making communication with the event\u2019s organizers difficult.\n\nWashington\n\nMount Vernon: Wildfire responders in western Washington are preparing for a particularly bad wildfire season. With less precipitation than normal so far in 2019 and snowpack in the North Cascades depleting rapidly, conditions are already abnormally dry, and much of the western side of the state has been declared in or at risk of drought. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a dry summer, and any outdoor burns are going to be risky,\u201d Skagit County Deputy Fire Marshal Mark Anderson told the Skagit Valley Herald. \u201cWe saw that in March.\u201d During that unusually dry month, 21 outdoor burns in the county got out of control. Deputy Fire Marshal Bonnie LaCount said the largest escalated into a 21-acre fire in the Rockport area. The second largest was a 5-acre, wind-driven fire in Clear Lake.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nAn M-41 Bulldog tank at the entrance of Bluefield, W.Va.\u2019s Lotito City Park was accidentally painted a lemon-lime green color instead of the standard olive.

Wisconsin Public Radio reports that a Michigan State University study estimated 1.78 million visits were made to Wisconsin\u2019s winery tasting rooms in 2015, bringing in nearly $50 million in wine tourism. The study\u2019s author, Dan McCole, is an associate professor of tourism and sustainability at Michigan State University. McCole found that most people don\u2019t visit Wisconsin\u2019s wineries to learn about wine but rather for leisure, such as family gatherings. He says the state\u2019s wineries are easy to get to from bigger cities, and Wisconsin doesn\u2019t need to produce the highest-quality wines. He says visitors are looking for a good experience.\n\nWyoming\n\nTourists check out the Grand Prismatic Spring at the Midway Geyser Basin in Yellowstone National Park.

The report last week from the National Park Service indicates the spending by the park\u2019s 4.1 million visitors supported nearly 7,100 jobs in the area in 2018. According to the report, the more than 468,000 visitors to Devils Tower National Monument in northeast Wyoming spent $30 million last year, supporting more than 400 jobs. The park service recorded more than 318 million visitors nationwide. The report shows they spent more than $20 billion in communities within 60 miles of parks to support 329,000 jobs. Of the nationwide visitor spending, nearly $7 billion was on lodging expenses and $4 billion on restaurants and bars.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/05/29/shakespeare-steel-mystery-rifle-goner-records-news-around-states/39523233/ Shakespeare and steel, mystery rifle, Goner Records: News from around our 50 states 5-2019", "doc_id": "1fbc7731-62b4-403a-814a-0eb1795048e0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f248f04ea0f990dc844eb27f20812285ac54c85dab225c685a6a539086866f00", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 43156, "end": 45237, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "5e52aa27-a9bf-4f78-acff-e16356d88fac", "2": "2f689ec8-c590-43d3-be0c-64d11e0542f8"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2ddd82a-46c7-4747-8f7d-02159bcb11c2": {"__data__": {"text": "Republican Greg Gianforte speaks to a member of the audience after debating Montana Gov.

Steve Bullock said in a statement posted to Facebook.\n\n\"Yesterday`s events serve as another wake up call to all Montanans and Americans that we must restore civility in politics and governing, and demand more from people who hold the public`s trust.\"\n\nGianforte was cited for misdemeanor assault on Wednesday after allegedly slamming The Guardian`s Ben Jacobs to the ground and punching him during a campaign rally in Bozeman. Audio of the incident, as well as an eyewitness account from a Fox News crew in the room, suggested no physical aggression on Jacobs`s part before the alleged assault.\n\nBut Gianforte`s campaign spun the incident differently, arguing in a statement that Jacobs himself was to blame:\n\n\"Jacobs grabbed Greg`s wrist, and spun away from Greg, pushing them both to the ground,\" the statement read. \"It`s unfortunate that this aggressive behavior from a liberal journalist created this scene at our campaign volunteer BBQ.\"\n\nThe incident began after Jacobs pressed Gianforte for comment on the Congressional Budget Office`s recently released evaluation of the American Health Care Act. It occurred a day before Montanans vote on whether Gianforte or his Democratic opponent Rob Quist will fill a congressional seat vacated when President Donald Trump tapped former Rep. Ryan Zinke to be his interior secretary.

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)\n\nCEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa \u2013 John Mertz, a retired state employee in a small and shrinking city, appreciated it when Amy Klobuchar stopped by for a town hall. On Friday, he stood at the back of a microbrewery to hear Beto O`Rourke make a pitch and take questions. Neither of them made him a believer, but they tried, and he had begun to wonder about the candidates who weren`t coming to Knoxville.\n\n\"Joe Biden`s quiet,\" said Mertz, 72. \"You don`t hear much about where he`s at or what he`s doing. I understand that there`s 19 of the Democrats going to Cedar Rapids, but not him, and that`s odd to me.\"\n\nBiden, who will return to Iowa on Tuesday, has been less visible in the state than most of his competitors. In late April, he told audiences that they`d be \"seeing a lot of him.\" In the last month, he didn`t visit the state at all; on Saturday, a Des Moines Register poll that has unusual power to set narratives showed his lead over the field slipping, with just 24 percent of potential caucus-goers picking him as their first choice.\n\nThe former vice president`s rivals have used that time to build up campaign operations in Iowa, banking on the state`s voters to reward the candidates they see and hear the most. While Biden`s campaign is ramping up \u2014 it will have 50 staff in the state by the end of June \u2014 the candidate will have skipped a party convention in California and an Iowa Hall of Fame dinner in Cedar Rapids, which bustled with rival Democrats and their supporters, taking every chance to get in front of voters.\n\n\"Joe Biden has a long history here,\" said former governor and agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack. \"He doesn`t need to introduce himself to Iowans like a lot of candidates do.\"\n\nAs Vilsack said that, he was standing in the lobby of the Cedar Rapids convention center, where supporters of Democrats such as Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar waved signs, banged glowing \"thundersticks\" and inserted their candidate`s names into old protest chants.\n\n\"There`s still plenty of time,\" Vilsack said, \"despite all of this.\"\n\nBiden had reasons for missing the Iowa gala, telling state Democratic chairman Troy Price that he was at a family event he would \"postpone an inauguration for.\" (It was his granddaughter`s high school graduation.) He would be coming back to Iowa two days later, and his campaign said that it was building, quietly, earlier than many previous Iowa operations. Voters who attended Biden`s first four events in the state, or RSVP`d for them, had gotten calls informing them of how they could help; the campaign had organized live-stream house parties on May 18, when Biden gave his extended launch speech in Philadelphia.\n\nA Biden campaign operative argued that the flashy, early organizing of some other campaigns came with risks candidates didn`t want to admit. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren`s campaign, which has the largest Iowa staff, spent around 87 cents for every dollar it raised from January through March. Former Maryland congressman John Delaney, who has opened eight offices in the state, has not moved up in polls or noticeably grown his crowds.\n\n\"We`re probably good with offices in Iowa,\" Delaney said in an interview.\n\nAnd former Texas congressman O`Rourke, who adapted the \"distributed organizing\" of the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign for his Senate race in Texas, has dipped in polling of Iowa after holding 15 town halls and about as many meet-and-greets, more than any other candidate who declared this year.\n\n\"This is the only way I know to learn what`s most important to the people of", "doc_id": "48edc276-52ef-4b89-a9dc-fa3445cf274b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0f9ca3f8a4407994a427a0777c3c4df423e0f50781eb36ac13c26f582edc6f6f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3891, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "54b6697f-94ba-465e-a60e-2326aa80d340", "3": "f3597f4b-c3a9-4f44-a9d4-2af15c34671c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3597f4b-c3a9-4f44-a9d4-2af15c34671c": {"__data__": {"text": "is the only way I know to learn what`s most important to the people of Iowa,\" O`Rourke explained after his Knoxville town hall. \"It`s to show up and listen to them; and not just the questions that get asked publicly, but in line, folks will say, `Hey you know, on your answer about this, have you thought about taking this additional step?` We`re writing down everything everyone tells us, and then incorporating that, as long as I agree with it, into the plans that we`re proposing for the country.\"\n\nThe record of candidate time in Iowa translating to votes in the caucuses is decidedly mixed. Ahead of the 2004 contest, John Edwards visited all 99 counties and surged to a second-place finish that helped him secure the party`s vice presidential nomination. Four years later, Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut moved to the state, putting his young children in local schools; he ran sixth in a field of eight candidates, then quit the race. Marianne Williamson, a self-help author, has moved to the state; in an interview, she downplayed what it meant for her campaign or for the media`s expectation.\n\n\"My lease was up in New York,\" she said. \"I`ve been living out of a suitcase!\"\n\nIt`s in the interest of most candidates, however, to play up their own Iowa work and draw attention to what the leader in the polls isn`t doing. After a Saturday morning house party in Des Moines, Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Ind., mayor, declined to talk about Biden but explained just how much he was getting from spending time in the state.\n\n\"The way the voters here really take seriously their responsibility and their position to evaluate who the next nominee and next president is going to be,\" Buttigieg said. \"It just makes it a great place to campaign and you`ll be seeing us here very often.\"\n\nSome Iowa Democrats, who have not seen this level of individual candidate organizing in a lifetime, want to prove that candidates must work the state and answer questions, or there will be setbacks.\n\n\"I call [Biden] the `leader,` with air quotes,\" said 2018 congressional candidate J.D. Scholten, whose narrow loss to Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) won him a following. \"He hasn`t been to western Iowa yet, and I know we have questions to ask him.\"\n\nOn Sunday, as Democrats took the Cedar Rapids stage without Biden, there was no evidence of his Iowa operation in sight. But there was not much evidence that rank-and-file Democrats wanted to punish him. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who had come into the state a day early to hold rallies and marched to the convention center with fast food workers, used some of his time onstage to attack \"a middle ground strategy that antagonizes no one, that stands up to nobody, and that changes nothing.\u201d\n\nIt was clear that he was referring to Biden; it was hard to hear much applause.\n\nREADING LIST\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden at the I Will Vote Fundraising Gala on Thursday in Atlanta.

Last night`s benchmark poll clarified both story lines. First: The vast majority of Democratic candidates are nowhere close to becoming viable in Iowa. (\"Viability\" means getting 15 percent or more in a caucus room.) Second: Biden is running behind previous \"front-runners\" at this point in previous cycles. At a similar point in 2007, John Edwards led the Iowa field with 29 percent support; Hillary Clinton led with 57 percent. And that`s why so many candidates continue to see a path past Biden.\n\nBut at this moment, it`s really Warren who shows the most room to grow in the state, with Harris not far behind. Warren now has the highest net favorable rating among Democratic voters; she and Harris are the second choice of the most voters, each getting 14 percent of them. Cory Booker is being \"actively considered\" by the most voters, 36 percent, but Harris and Warren are close behind; 32 percent of voters say they`re at least considering support for them. Also in the \"actively considering\" club: Beto O`Rourke, who despite tumbling as a \"first choice\" is still being considered by 33 percent of voters.\n\nNo campaign thinks the June 2019 polling fully captures what will happen in February 2020. But it does suggest that some campaigns have been effective over the past few months, and some haven`t. Sanders, who started his campaign seven weeks after Warren`s, is only now catching up in on-the-ground staff, but his universe of supporters is shrinking; he`s pulling just one third of the support he got in the 2016 caucuses.\n\nON THE TRAIL\n\nDES MOINES \u2014 On Saturday afternoon, while half of the Democratic presidential contenders fanned out across Iowa, 600 voters packed a high school auditorium to hear from a candidate who`d already dropped out. Richard Ojeda, a former West Virginia legislator whose White House run lasted just 75 days, thundered that any Democrat worthy of the presidency would back \"free college for all of our students\" and \"make the top one percent finally pay\" higher taxes.\n\n\"We need candidates who will do just that!\" Ojeda said. \"If they won`t do that just, kick `em off your porch!\"\n\nThe crowd at the \"Revolution Rally,\" organized by the liberal news network The Young Turks, cheered, and waved signs \u2014 \"HIGHER WAGES,\" \"GREEN NEW DEAL\" \u2014 in the network`s yellow and black colors. Ojeda was there to launch the \"TYT Army,\" the latest and loudest organization dedicated to pressuring candidates into taking hard stands on issues.\n\n\"We want to clarify what the `progressive` position is, because it feels like the media is calling everybody a progressive,\" Cenk Uygur, the network`s founder and main host, said in an interview before the rally. \"So, the TYT Army is going to find the candidates, and ask them questions, and keep asking them, and asking them.\"\n\nPresidential candidates, who spend the months before the first primary contests taking questions from voters, have made their peace with pressure groups. They see them every cycle, in different guises, from the Moms Demand Action questioners who show up in their red and white shirts, to the \"bird-dogging\" climate", "doc_id": "032cb15a-2d78-4172-a717-5ad965081e1b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f6678fe0cb2edcd36418624f3f564a2fe20a32e3aa35a9b395ef5c0d897edd08", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 7714, "end": 11416, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "54b6697f-94ba-465e-a60e-2326aa80d340", "2": "f3597f4b-c3a9-4f44-a9d4-2af15c34671c", "3": "f170d0f9-7a74-4e5d-9310-1557b431ed55"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f170d0f9-7a74-4e5d-9310-1557b431ed55": {"__data__": {"text": "who show up in their red and white shirts, to the \"bird-dogging\" climate activists who will use their time in a rope or photo line to flip open a phone and record as they ask about getting off of fossil fuels.\n\nThe pressure group electorate had been moving left already; the ACLU`s \"rights voters,\" who sign up to learn how to approach candidates and ask the meatiest policy questions, have gotten Bernie Sanders to endorse voting rights for prisoners, and gotten Joe Biden to (eventually) abandon a ban on federal money paying for abortion.\n\nBut TYT, with its 6 million subscribers, has a particularly active and left-wing audience. Uygur, who co-founded Justice Democrats two years ago, set out to replace \"corporate Democrats\" with like-minded \"progressives.\" Just 18 months later, Justice Democrats helped elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which undeniably changed the party and its internal debate, an achievement Uygur feels that the left does not get enough credit for.\n\n\"If Breitbart elected a member of Congress, you would never stop hearing about it,\" he said.\n\nTYT has launched a few other projects designed to put 2020 Democrats on the record, starting with an occasional interview series where the candidates are grilled on their commitments. The goal of the new army is to get straight answers, yes or no, on the \"progressive economic pledge,\" an agenda TYT sketched out after consulting with some like-minded members of Congress. Ocasio-Cortez was one of the initial endorsers; the presidential candidates were next.\n\nThe five-plank pledge syncs up with the agenda of Sanders`s campaign, though some of his rivals have endorsed parts of it. To get right with the TYT Army, a candidate must commit to a constitutional amendment \"banning the private financing of elections,\" free college tuition, Medicare-for-all, the Green New Deal, and a worker`s agenda that includes a $15 minimum wage and an expansion of labor rights.\n\n\"If you get elected and you don`t fight for these things, we`re going to be all over for you,\" Uygur said. \"If Elizabeth Warren gets elected and says, `well, I like Medicare-for-all, but Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer say we can only get a public option,` then, okay: We`re going to surround the White House.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Uygur began to test the pledge in the field. He roamed the convention center in Cedar Rapids, with a camera crew, asking the candidates he could find whether they would sign the pledge. John Delaney went point by point, saying where he disagreed. Jay Inslee told Uygur that he would be handling press questions later in the day.\n\nAt a small rally outside the convention center, Uygur spoke to dozens of activists in new TYT Army shirts, urging them to get in the potential presidents` faces. Within a few hours, three candidates \u2014 Sanders, Marianne Williamson, and an absent Mike Gravel \u2014 had signed the pledge.\n\n\"They`re going to hear a lot from us!\" he said.\n\n2020\n\nBernie Sanders. He`s giving the first major speech of his campaign on Wednesday, discussing why \"democratic socialism is the only way to defeat oligarchy and authoritarianism\" at George Washington University. It is likely to expand on several previous speeches he`s given about combatting right-wing nationalism, but could also echo the November 2015 speech he gave on \"democratic socialism\" at Georgetown.\n\nSteve Bullock.

Grim`s shop began covering the battles inside the Democratic Party closely, and with an angle; the party`s establishment was broken, and candidates who turned down big money were trying to fix it.\n\nThis week, Grim published \"We`ve Got People,\" a history of the party`s grass-roots movements and the forces that usually defeated it, personified by former Chicago Mayor and former congressman and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chief Rahm Emanuel. Grim talked to The Trailer about the book this week; a lightly edited transcript follows\n\nThe Trailer: How long have you been writing this book?\n\nRyan Grim: [HuffPost reporter] Arthur Delaney and I actually were kicking around a book like this in the spring of 2010 as the Affordable Care Act was wrapping up, and we outlined what it would look like. But we eventually concluded it just wasn`t there yet. My take was that there wasn`t really a protagonist for the story yet. You couldn`t really wrap it around [former Rep.] Lynn Woolsey, and Elizabeth Warren was still a law professor.\n\nBut I kept taking notes on the idea over the next decade. I was on the train coming back from the Bronx on June 27, from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez`s victory party, when it clicked. It was like: Oh, people care now! The Sanders campaign brought a ton of people in to the process. Then Trump winning brought another several million people from casual observers to fanatic activists. And then Ocasio-Cortez showed that Sanders was not a one-off phenomenon.\n\nTT: There`s a lot of contemporary reporting here, and a lot of history. What did you learn that you didn`t know before digging in?\n\nRG: I wasn`t quite as familiar with Jesse Jackson`s 1988 campaign. I had vaguely heard of the Michigan upset; I didn`t realize the depth of the panic that it set off, when Jesse beat Michael Dukakis. But the story started before that, with the Chicago machine establishment`s reaction to Harold Washington winning the Democratic primary for mayor in 1983. I didn`t realize that the party flipped like it did; Washington wins the 1983 primary and the machine does what the left always fears and warns that the machine is going to do: They literally switched sides and supported the Republican in the general election.\n\nSo in Chicago, then and now an almost universally Democratic city, Washington wins by four points in the general election. The police chief worked against him and so did all of the bosses of the machine including [the late Rep.] Dan Rostenkowski, who was literally Harold Washington`s congressional colleague. That, to me, was stunning, and that launched Jesse Jackson`s campaign; Jesse worked closely with Washington and when he saw the party establishment fighting against him, he decided that they needed to fight back in a more insurgent way.\n\nTT: What was something you learned, from your research, is widely believed by Democrats but not really true?\n\nRG: The 2006 midterms. Having covered them and having thought about them since then, I`ve always thought that Rahm`s celebration of himself was overblown. But looking at it race by race I was I was surprised at just how overblown it was. He pulled off such a PR magic trick with it that when I went back, every data point just kept backing up the idea that he was wrong; he insisted that progressive candidates couldn`t win and they did. [As chairman of the Democratic congressional committee] He pulled money out of races where they won the primaries, and the Republicans lost.\n\nTT: Did you identify some moment or pivot point when the left blew it, where if some different decisions had been made it wouldn`t have lost its power in the party?\n\nRG: You had this moment, after Watergate. The party is fired up, party activists are fired up, and the country is thoroughly rejecting Republicans. And so that is one reason you get so many candidates running in 1976 is that they all recognize the same thing that the Democrats recognize about 2020: They have a very good shot at being elected president. So as a result you get this flood of candidates, and Jimmy Carter squeaks through, and instead of delivering the kind of agenda that", "doc_id": "029b5d5b-e1d8-46da-8b07-035f7fa29947", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1864a970a08002ce8338014919f7467327a96858fe22a5e9597c4931fb589c79", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 15376, "end": 19531, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "54b6697f-94ba-465e-a60e-2326aa80d340", "2": "f170d0f9-7a74-4e5d-9310-1557b431ed55", "3": "9921f65e-cafa-41e6-8362-ad1362ed4b90"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "9921f65e-cafa-41e6-8362-ad1362ed4b90": {"__data__": {"text": "and Jimmy Carter squeaks through, and instead of delivering the kind of agenda that might have been possible, like card check, they go into this frenzy of deregulation. Had Democrats acted differently, you could have avoided the whole Reagan revolution.\n\nThe more recent example is that the Obama decision not to mobilize his base, and to pass a stimulus that was too small. What if he said, look, this is the stimulus that we need right now, I`m putting it on the floor: Go ahead, I dare you to vote it down. Let the Dow drop a thousand points and then we`re putting it back on the floor next week. Instead he said, `Well, [Obama economic chief] Larry Summers says we can`t get more than $700 billion so we`re just going to have to live with 10 percent unemployment for the next several years,` which not just produces an intense amount of pain around the country but basically helps launch the rise of authoritarianism here and abroad.\n\nTT: You write a lot about the organizing techniques of the Sanders campaign, but the campaign lost. How effective are those tactics, really, and what are they?\n\nRG: The best quote on that was from [Sanders`s 2016 digital organizing director] Claire Sandberg, saying that by the time we had built the airplane we had run out of runway. And that`s kind of a key point to understand. By the time they ended up having 200 million texts to voters, or whatever, 90 percent of those were after Iowa. They didn`t really get their operation up and running late January, February. The example to look at is Beto; he uses these techniques and he wound up overperforming his polls by several points. Now, he`s not running that operation anymore. But I think Iowa will be a big test to see whether a grass-roots operation and distributed organizing can perform in caucuses.\n\nTT: What`s going to come from the DCCC cutting off consultants who work for candidates running against incumbents?\n\nRG: I think they`re really going to come to regret this decision. One of the one of the main sources of power that the district [clique] has is this ecosystem that it has built up. It is the consulting world; it revolves around these party committees. And that means that you know you kind of, whether or not there`s a blacklist, got to stay in the good graces of these party committee structures. But if people create an entire independent structure and they have no control over it, that gives this nascent movement access to professional [campaign] assistance.\n\nCOUNTDOWN\n\n... three days until the cutoff for the first Democratic debates\n\n... 17 days until the first Democratic debates\n\n... 21 days until the end of the fundraising quarter The Trailer: In Iowa, polls and the ground game start to clarify a competitive race for the 2020 caucuses 6-2019", "doc_id": "9921f65e-cafa-41e6-8362-ad1362ed4b90", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7e3b6af8972dc963967d782469136de959cecf7443e4a2c9247759b560c34dcf", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 19517, "end": 22289, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "54b6697f-94ba-465e-a60e-2326aa80d340", "2": "029b5d5b-e1d8-46da-8b07-035f7fa29947"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a20b4319-bdd7-4dae-a7f8-a4ac484a597f": {"__data__": {"text": "CLOSE\n\nAlabama\n\nRodney Smith Jr., founder of Raising Men Lawn Care Service, looks skyward while talking with homeowner Irene Renee Jolly in Huntsville, Ala.

Jessie Grieb finished her East Coast Overdose Awareness Walk on Friday at Key West\u2019s Southernmost Point in the Continental U.S. marker. Friday marked the fourth anniversary of her brother Brian\u2019s death by accidental overdose. Grieb\u2019s boyfriend succumbed to heroin, and she has struggled herself with addiction since she was 17. The Pawleys Island resident started her journey in Fort Kent, Maine, on July 28, 2018, after she had suffered a relapse. To help carry supplies, Grieb pushed a small cart named \u201cLieutenant Dan\u201d in honor of the \u201cForrest Gump\u201d character who dealt with addiction in the movie.\n\nGeorgia\n\n21 Savage (Photo: THEO WARGO, WireImage)\n\nAtlanta: Grammy-nominated rapper 21 Savage has given $25,000 to the Southern Poverty Law Center after the watchdog organization helped him while he was in federal immigration custody earlier this year. The rapper, whose real name is She\u2019yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, was arrested Feb. 3 in what U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has said was a targeted operation over his expired visa. Abraham-Joseph is a British citizen and moved to the U.S. when he was 7. In a statement, immigration attorney Charles Kuck said the Atlanta-based rapper wants to support the work the SPLC has done to give immigrants legal representation and fight what Kuck called ICE\u2019s \u201coppressively adverse conditions of detention.\u201d The rapper spent 10 days at the Irwin County Detention Center before he was released on a $100,000 bond.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A man injured during a rockfall in a state park was among five people cited for trespassing, officials say. State officials cited Lincoln Hittner of Honolulu for trespassing in a closed park, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Hittner was treated for minor injuries by Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement officers in Sacred Falls State Park, officials say. Hittner described his near-miss with the rockfall as \u201c15 seconds of terror,\u201d officials say. He was among a group of six that included Hawaii residents and a visiting Australian who all received citations, authorities say. Sacred Falls State Park has been closed and warning signs posted since a 1999 accident left eight people dead and dozens hurt, officials say. The state has extensively publicized the dangers of entering closed areas, including a video about Sacred Falls, according to the Department of Land and Natural Resources.\n\nIdaho\n\nJon Heder stars in \"Napoleon Dynamite,\" set in Preston, Idaho.

Promoters of Mamby on the Beach are seeking a permit from the Chicago Park District to move the show to Montrose Beach on the city\u2019s north side. But two piping plovers lately have been making the beach their home. Four eggs were discovered and turned over to the Lincoln Park Zoo last week. The plovers appear to be making a new nest, said Louise Clemency of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. MAMBY on the Beach is scheduled to take place Aug. 23-24 and expected to draw up to 20,000 people to the Lake Michigan lakefront each day. But Jill Niland of the Montrose Lakefront Coalition says there are concerns about the number of people expected to attend and noise pollution that could disrupt the piping plovers. The small shorebird is on state endangered species lists and listed as threatened at the federal level.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A change state lawmakers made this year to a tax incentive for startups is being hailed as a big win for the tech industry because it promises to make it easier for fledgling businesses to attract out-of-state investors. The Indianapolis Business Journal reports that legislation signed by Gov. Eric Holcomb will allow investors to transfer Indiana\u2019s Venture Capital Investment tax credits, starting next year. Transferring the credits will allow out-of-state investors to essentially sell them to someone in the state who can take advantage. Tech community leaders say the change will encourage out-of-state individuals to invest in Indiana startups. The state\u2019s VCI tax credit program allows someone who invests in an Indiana startup to claim a tax credit worth 20% of the investment. The credit is capped at $1 million.\n\nIowa\n\nAndrew Dunham harvests Hakurei turnips on his 80-acre organic farm in Grinnell, Iowa. (Photo: Charlie Neibergall/AP)\n\nDes Moines: Torrential rain this spring prevented most Midwest farmers from planting their crops, but while the federal government provides help to growers of corn and soybeans, those who grow so-called specialty crops are largely on their own. Although the lack of federal safety net programs for farmers who grow everything from arugula to zucchini isn\u2019t new, one of the wettest springs in U.S. history has focused attention on the special status of commodity crops, primarily corn, soybeans, cotton, rice and wheat. Iowa organic farmer Andrew Dunham shrugs at the situation, noting that \u201cthere are no federal bailouts for vegetable farmers.\u201d Iowa State University economist Chad Hart says crops like corn and soybeans are treated differently because they\u2019re so important to the national economy, and shortages would be painful, particularly to the livestock industry.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Two endangered Mexican wolf pups from a Kansas zoo have been released into the wild in Arizona.

Until June 23, zoo visitors can make a donation to choose their favorite name. There will be a naming kiosk with three slots in the plaza to the right near the zoo\u2019s entrance. The calf will be given the name that receives the most donations, to be announced during the week of June 24. All donations in the competition will go to the zoo\u2019s conservation efforts. Bongos are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s Red List of Threatened Species and are listed as a \u201cnear threatened\u201d species. The future Drax, Groot or Rocket is on exhibit along with his mother and the other bongos.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A state court official has agreed to take steps to make sure defendants in criminal cases aren\u2019t jailed because they cannot afford bail. The agreement is detailed in a federal court order filed Thursday involving Magistrate Judge Harry Cantrell and plaintiffs who accused Cantrell of violating an earlier federal judgment regarding low-income defendants. As a magistrate judge in the criminal district court in New Orleans, Cantrell sets bail for people arrested on various state charges. The agreement details requirements for determining whether a defendant can afford bail and whether the defendant is a flight risk or poses a danger when alternatives to bail are considered. U.S. District Judge Eldon Fallon issued Thursday\u2019s order detailing the agreement and closing the case against Cantrell.\n\nMaine\n\nDover-Foxcroft: Police say a moose smashed through the window of a vacant pizzeria. Piscataquis County corrections officer Matt Poole snapped a photo of the moose stepping through broken glass onto East Main Street early Friday. The Dover-Foxcroft Police Department posted on Facebook, \u201cWe found the suspect and they are not in custody. Boring right?\u201d Maine has plenty of moose, and sometimes they wander into towns. But Police Chief Ryan Reardon says it was the first time in 26 years he\u2019d seen one run into a building.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered that starting Saturday, two of the iconic rainbow flags will fly on the George W. Romney Building to help celebrate June as Pride Month in Michigan. The flying of the flags comes after Whitmer signed a proclamation designating June as Pride Month to mark the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising in New York City. A police raid on a gay bar called the Stonewall Inn triggered a series of riots and sparked the nascent LGBT movement in the country and around the world. In a news release, Whitmer said celebrating Pride Month helps ensure that members of Michigan\u2019s LGBTQ community \u201care treated with the respect they deserve.\u201d\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: University of Minnesota regents have voted to allow beer and wine sales in the general seating sections of the school\u2019s basketball and hockey arenas. Friday\u2019s vote was unanimous and comes as the school is trying to drive up revenue at sporting events. The university has been dropping some ticket prices in response to declining attendance. The Star Tribune reports that athletic director Mark Coyle told regents that campus police back the expanded alcohol sales, as does a fan advisory council. TCF Bank Stadium expanded alcohol sales to general seating areas in 2012. Overall alcohol revenue at the football stadium has been about $1.3 million annually, with most of that coming from general seating, the Star Tribune reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nTammy Wynette (Photo: Raeanne Rubenstein)\n\nMeridian: Five more members have been added to a hall of fame that honors the arts and entertainment in the Magnolia State.

The Southeast Missourian reports that The Bar in downtown Cape Girardeau had been closed since last fall. Representative for the management company that owns it and several other downtown properties say the establishment will resume serving drinks June 27. Formerly a catering business, the corner site was transformed into The Bar for the 2014 film \u201cGone Girl\u201d starring Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike and Neil Patrick Harris. After the movie was released, the set was converted into a real restaurant and bar. General manager Derek Vaughn says it will no longer serve food and will only be open Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 4 p.m. until 1:30 a.m.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Lawmakers did not have enough support to override four vetoes by Democratic Gov.

The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission says those recreation areas are Branched Oak near Malcolm, Fort Kearny near Kearney, Pawnee near Emerald, Wagon Train near Hickman, and those near Memphis and Fremont. Those parks will permit fireworks from 8 a.m. until midnight on July 4 only. Signs at recreation areas will point the way to designated fireworks sites, and their boundaries will be clearly marked. Use of fireworks elsewhere in state areas or at other times is prohibited. Only fireworks approved for sale in Nebraska are permitted, and visitors must pick up expended fireworks and deposit them in appropriate containers.\n\nNevada\n\nBurners climb on an art installation titled \"Night of the Climb\" by Dustin Weatherford at Burning Man on Aug. 27, 2018.

The Bureau of Land Management on Friday issued the final environmental impact statement for Burning Man, denying the Burning Man organization its sought-after growth to 100,000 people but granting it more time to address a number of environmental and security concerns. The federal agency may, however, hire a private security firm this year to conduct drug screenings. Or it might wait until 2020, according to BLM spokesman Rudy Evenson. As for the growth of the event, the population cap will remain at 80,000 people for the weeklong event held each year over Labor Day weekend in Northern Nevada\u2019s Black Rock Desert.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHampton Falls: Enthusiastic clapping \u2013 and some furious flapping \u2013 marked the end to the saga of designating an official state raptor. Republican Gov. Chris Sununu on Friday signed a bill honoring the red-tailed hawk. As applause broke out, a bird being held just over his shoulder began flapping its wings. The bill was proposed by Hampton Falls fourth graders four years ago, but it was killed after one lawmaker injected the issue of abortion into the debate by saying the hawk\u2019s habit of tearing apart prey \u201climb from limb\u201d would make it an ideal mascot for Planned Parenthood. The students, now in eighth grade, lobbied for a new bill this year and were successful. Sununu told them they exemplified a lesson in perseverance.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A year after gunfire shattered the city\u2019s annual Art All Night festival, hundreds flocked to this year\u2019s celebration of local art, music, food and films \u2013 even though, strictly speaking, it no longer quite lived up to the name. The formerly \u201call night\u201d festival took a break from 1 a.m. to 7 a.m. Sunday before resuming for the morning and afternoon. And for the first time in the festival\u2019s 13-year history, the event was fenced off, and attendees had to go through security checkpoints before entering the event space that included visible police and security officers. The June 17 shooting last year left a suspect dead and 22 people injured in what authorities said looked like neighborhood gang dispute. But those attending this year to examine the more than 800 pieces of art displayed inside and outside the Roebling Wireworks Building spoke of moving forward rather than looking backward.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state\u2019s film industry appears to be on the brink of a boom thanks to abortion law controversies in other states and expanded incentives.

Police say he shot himself in the head on a Staten Island street near the 121st Precinct to which the officer was assigned. His identity had not been released as of late Friday. The week before, two longtime officers died in suspected suicides within 24 hours of each other. Deputy Chief Steven Silks was found dead in a police vehicle in Queens on June 5. Detective Joseph Calabrese was found the next day at a Brooklyn beach. Police say both died from self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the head. In the wake of the deaths, Commissioner James O\u2019Neill sent a note reminding the more than 36,000 officers and 19,000 civilians in the NYPD that help is available if they\u2019re feeling depressed, hopeless or otherwise contemplating self-harm.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state won\u2019t clear voting-machine makers to sell their systems to county elections boards until it learns more about who owns them, the elections board chairman said Friday. The decision comes amid worries of foreign election interference that have grown since special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s April report into Russian efforts to sway the 2016 election. Mueller\u2019s report \u201cessentially says everybody should be concerned about this, and everybody should be looking harder at a lot of these things to make sure we\u2019re protected as best we can be,\u201d said Robert Cordle, the head of the state elections board. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of doing our due diligence now.\u201d The state board is giving the three companies that have already passed several rounds of screening until Friday to disclose anyone holding a 5% or greater interest in their company, their parent company or any subsidiaries.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Lutheran Social Services of North Dakota plans to acquire the Ruth Meiers Hospitality House\u2019s property in Bismarck and turn the facility into affordable housing.

The sale of the site is \u201cin the works,\u201d Lutheran Social Services CEO Jessica Thomasson told The Bismarck Tribune. Choice Bank took ownership of the facility last month. \u201cThe reason we got involved was to try to preserve these 85 units of affordable housing in Bismarck because it\u2019s hard when a community loses an asset like that to ever get it back,\u201d Thomasson said. She said the plans include retaining the 85 apartments, renovating some of the units and common areas, and turning underutilized space into 20 additional apartments.\n\nOhio\n\nFirefighters assemble a tube around farmer Jay Butterfield during the process of rescuing him from a soybean bin on his farm in Ross Township, Ohio.

About 200 people gathered Friday near the headquarters of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes in Concho. Many wore red and marched, holding signs with pictures of women on them. Similar demonstrations have taken place in other states amid growing concern that police nationwide are not adequately identifying or reporting cases of missing and murdered Native American and Alaska Native women and girls. Those demographic groups have some of the nation\u2019s highest rates of sexual and domestic violence. Kateri Fletcher, a Cheyenne and Arapaho tribal government official who helped organize the event, said it was designed to bring awareness and show support for families who still need answers.\n\nOregon\n\nAurora: A global hemp research lab in the state is part of a larger movement to bring the standardization to hemp that traditional crops like corn and cotton enjoy. It\u2019s a critical step toward accountability and consistency in an industry that\u2019s sprung up almost overnight since the U.S. legalized hemp last year. The Global Hemp Innovation Center was unveiled recently by Oregon State University and will be the largest such research hub in the U.S. Oregon State will also begin certifying hemp seeds so that farmers can be confident they\u2019re getting quality seeds. A national review board for hemp varieties is also getting up and running. Interest in the cannabis crop has exploded because of hemp-derived CBD, a compound marketed as having health benefits but without the high caused by marijuana.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBloomsburg: For the past 15 years, Bloomsburg University students have been quietly stocking the shelves of a town food cupboard, donating more than a ton of food and more than $15,000 in meal-plan funds each year. With the help of those donations, volunteers at the Bloomsburg Food Cupboard have been able to bag breakfast, lunch and snacks for elementary students from poor families to take home each weekend, says cupboard director Martha Sheehe. University students who have meal plan \u201cFLEX\u201d money left in their accounts at the end of the academic year can either spend it down or donate it, says Tom McGuire, director of media relations at BU. Sometimes students will buy cases of water or soda to drain their accounts, but many donate their remaining cash to ARAMARK, the university\u2019s dining service, which then purchases food to fill the elementary students\u2019 \u201cPanther Packs.\u201d\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has preserved 43 acres of open space to provide more recreational opportunities. The Department of Environmental Management says it\u2019s using about $250,000 provided through open space bonds to permanently protect forested land in Charlestown for public recreational access. DEM Director Janet Coit says she\u2019s delighted to secure this valuable parcel and encouraged residents to explore it. The property abuts DEM\u2019s Burlingame Management Area. That area, with the adjoining Burlingame State Park, encompasses more than 4,000 contiguous acres of protected land that\u2019s managed for public recreation, including fishing, hunting and camping.

Surveyors 122 years ago messed up drawing the county line between Berkeley and Dorchester counties. The Post and Courier of Charleston reports the mistake was officially corrected last year, leaving an apartment complex and a senior living home split between the two counties. State officials have been working for a decade to precisely map county boundaries. Tenants at the Farmington Village Apartments are told that the unit they select will decide whether their children go to schools in Berkeley County or Dorchester County. The Village at Summerville senior living complex is split, too, but has arranged to have Dorchester County Emergency Medical Service answer all of its calls. The redrawn boundary has changed tax bills too.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A business development center that was launched more than a decade ago on the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology campus is coming out of the shadows. The Rapid City Journal reports that the Ascent Innovation Center, which opened in a remote corner of the campus in 2006, has outgrown its space and is poised to expand to a more visible location, in downtown Rapid City. School officials say construction on the $12 million business incubator could begin this summer, thanks in part to a $3 million federal grant that puts the new center in range of being fully funded. The architect of the project is Wisconsin-based Strang Inc., which specializes in design of innovation centers and research parks. The building is slated for completion in late 2020.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Peanuts, cracker jacks, hot dogs ... mayonnaise?

He started eating early in the game, and by the fourth inning he moved to a different seat and continued eating from the jar with a spoon before security had him moved to another seat. That didn\u2019t stop the mayo eater as he found a new place and continued eating it in the fifth inning. The Redbirds\u2019 Twitter account kept a running commentary, as insiders were apparently as shocked and confused as fans watching it on social media. Even Minor League Baseball\u2019s Twitter account got wind of the fan\u2019s snack and tweeted further disgust.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston resident Scenacia Jones stands in front of her new home, part of an innovative program that builds houses after natural disasters and lets families live in one part of the structure while the rest is completed. (Photo: Juan Lozano/AP)\n\nHouston: The groups behind an innovative way of rebuilding homes after a natural disaster say their approach will save money and get people into housing more quickly. They\u2019re hoping a bill signed last week by Gov. Greg Abbott related to disaster planning will boost their efforts. The housing program known as Rapido, Spanish for fast, debuted its first such home built in Houston last week. Under the program, a core unit made up of pre-built panels is assembled. A family lives in this core while the rest of the house is built around them. The Texas agency that has handled housing recovery following Hurricane Harvey in 2017 says it supports such innovations but says rule changes would be needed to free up federal funding to support such ideas.\n\nUtah\n\nJohn R.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture said last week that the country produced 4.2 million gallons of the pancake topper, up 1% from 2018. Leading producer Vermont made more than 2 million gallons, an increase over 2018. Data shows Vermont was followed by New York, Maine and Wisconsin. The USDA says the earliest sap flow reported was Jan. 5 in New York. The season lasted an average of 30 days in syrup-producing states, compared with 42 last year. Amanda Voyer, of the Vermont Maple Sugar Makers Association, says the conditions made for some strong days of sap flow in trees.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State Attorney General Mark Herring is calling for the legalization of marijuana. Herring said Saturday that Virginia should start decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana and eventually legalize the drug. The Democratic attorney general said criminal prosecutions are costly to the state and local governments and disproportionately affect African Americans. Herring made the remarks in an op-ed in the Daily Press and in comments to reporters at a Democratic fundraiser in Richmond. Herring\u2019s announcement won\u2019t have any practical impact on marijuana prosecutions, which are typically handled at the local level. But Herring said he hopes his public support for legalization will help spur lawmakers to act. The Republican-controlled General Assembly has killed past efforts to decriminalize marijuana.\n\nWashington\n\nBellingham: A Christian organization has fired a teenager from his job as a camp counselor because he is gay. The Bellingham Herald reports Jace Taylor says he was terminated Tuesday after being hired last month by THE FIRS to be a Fir Creek camp counselor. The nondenominational Christian organization confirmed that Taylor\u2019s sexual orientation was the reason for his firing. Executive Director Tom Beaumont says when it became evident that Taylor didn\u2019t personally align with the group\u2019s statements of faith, it determined it could not use him in the role. Under state law, an employer cannot discriminate against anyone based on sexual orientation. QLaw Foundation executive director Denise Diskin says religious nonprofit employers are not defined as employers under the law. Taylor says he intends to picket on the first day of camp to inform people there of the situation.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nRoanoke: Students participating in the state\u2019s new program for free tuition at public community colleges will have to pass a drug test that includes marijuana. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports the board of the West Virginia Community and Technical College System listened to a presentation Thursday from a consultant helping launch the program. Kathy Butler said the testing will include the marijuana component THC as well as opiates, cocaine, amphetamines and other drugs. Butler said the testing is modeled after that used by WorkForce West Virginia, a state job placement and training organization. Students will be required to pass the drug test within 60 days of the start of a semester to receive free tuition for that semester. The policy does allow exemptions for legally prescribed medicines.\n\nWisconsin\n\nLine cook Alex Minear, center, cuts up mushrooms as the DanDan kitchen staff prepares for the lunch rush.

He says the school now has a staff member with a desire to teach the language. The first class will acquaint students with the basic sounds of the Arapaho language.

In the second class, students will use the basic sounds to form Arapaho words and phrases in order to have conversations or tell short stories.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/06/17/mowing-quest-mayo-man-soybean-scare-news-around-states/39589183/ Mowing quest, mayo man, soybean scare: News from around our 50 states 6-2019", "doc_id": "d05677c8-5fc6-4ed0-8fde-1a1fb0619c4e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "46fb7e7ff9b799f00b17d453d6081a78addc1e1f120d8a0d434ae83832a67d85", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 43915, "end": 45933, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "bbe5a51f-d80e-4711-9113-4423f24a752b", "2": "2e83bd5b-04d1-43af-a27e-52d629a0a0db"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "12376a5c-9ca5-47ec-a7a8-70333e84617e": {"__data__": {"text": "A Job Corps firefighter removes the invasive common buckthorn to protect biodiversity in Black Hills National Forest in South Dakota on Oct. 2, 2014. (Boxelder Job Corps)\n\nThe Trump administration on Wednesday scrapped plans to kill a U.S. Forest Service program that trains disadvantaged young people for rural jobs after a bipartisan outcry from Congress.\n\nThe decision came after weeks of heavy pressure from lawmakers from Montana to Kentucky, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). The Forest Service had planned to begin layoffs of 1,110 employees by September, believed to be the largest number of cuts to the federal workforce in a decade.\n\nThe offices of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, whose agencies oversee the 25 Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers and dozens of others in urban areas, said in a joint statement that the administration is committed to making the program \u201cbetter and stronger.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the time being, USDA does not intend to transfer these centers to [the Labor Department] to allow management to determine a pathway that will maximize opportunity and results for students, minimize disruptions, and improve overall performance and integrity,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe administration \u201cwill conduct a robust organizational review to determine the appropriate course of action, keeping in mind the [Forest Service] mission, the students we serve, and the American taxpayers.\u201d\n\n[Trump administration to pull out of rural Job Corps program, laying off 1,100 federal employees]\n\nThe reversal, first reported by Politico, comes less than a month after Forest Service chief Vicki Christiansen told her staff in an anguished phone call that many of them would be laid off.\n\nNine Job Corps centers in Montana, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Virginia, Washington state, North Carolina, Oregon and Kentucky were scheduled to close, and an additional 16 were to be taken over by private companies or states.\n\nAgriculture officials said at the time that that many of the centers operated by the Forest Service were low-performing, some with security problems, low enrollment and uncertain job prospects for graduates. Perdue said Job Corps was not a \u201ccore mission\u201d of the Forest Service.\n\nBut the planned closures quickly ran headlong into political reality: Most were in Republican strongholds President Trump won in 2016.\n\nWhile the president and his GOP allies on Capitol Hill have put a high premium on downsizing the federal government, lawmakers facing reelection campaigns next year were loath to sacrifice economic drivers back home, however small.\n\nIn a rare break with the administration, Republicans joined Democrats in fighting not just the shutdowns but the effort to hand over operations to private companies. The opponents included Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), whose timber-producing district on the Canadian border already is losing jobs, and Rep. H. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.), whose Southwest Virginia district in Appalachian coal country has yet to see the fruits of Trump\u2019s promises to revive the industry.\n\nWith two centers in Kentucky on the closure list, McConnell wrote Perdue and Acosta a letter of protest, citing the loss to \u201cdistressed Kentucky counties with unemployment rates above the national average,\u201d which \u201cneed more support, not less.\u201d\n\nIn a separate letter signed by 51 Democrats and Republicans, lawmakers took issue with the administration\u2019s claim that many of the centers announced for closure were poor performers.\n\nJob Corps has its roots in the New Deal-era Civilian Conservation Corps, the popular work-relief program for unemployed, unmarried men that operated from 1933 to 1942. The current program dates to the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.\n\nMany of the centers employ fewer than 100 people and train as many students each year. But in small-town America, they have an outsize economic presence.\n\nIn perhaps the clearest sign of GOP discontent, Sen.

Despite being accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls and facing life in prison, Epstein ultimately pleaded guilty to less serious charges related to prostitution and spent just 13 months in jail, most of it in a work release program that allowed him leave the jail six days a week to work at his private home office. (Epstein also registered as a sex offender as part of the deal).\n\nEpstein`s alleged victims were never notified of the secret deal, with a federal judge ruling in February that the Department of Justice violated the Crime Victims` Rights Act by not disclosing to them the non-prosecution agreement with Epstein.\n\nDuring a press conference on Wednesday to address his handling of the Epstein case, particularly the lenient plea deal, Acosta struck back against criticism and suggested the deal was better than nothing. He declined to apologize to victims or offer his regret, instead noting how \"we live in a very different world. Today`s world treats victims very, very differently.\"\n\nDemocratic leaders such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and California Sen.

Associated Press/Alex Brandon\n\nRepublican senator Benjamin Sasse of Nebraska has been vocal in his demands for the Justice Department to investigate its treatment of Epstein, following the shocking Miami Herald investigative series published earlier this year that included interviews from scores of women who said they were sexually abused by the lucrative hedge fund manager.\n\nDuring Attorney General William Barr`s January confirmation hearing, Sasse brought up the plea deal, questioning Barr on whether there would be a thorough investigation into the matter if he was confirmed as Attorney General. \"I`ll make sure your questions are answered on this case,\" Barr responded at the time. Sasse ultimately voted to confirm Barr`s nomination.\n\nIn a statement provided to INSIDER on Wednesday, a spokesperson for Sasse said the senator \"believes that Epstein received a pathetically soft sentence and that this cannot happen again,\" adding that \"we will wait to comment on the particular details of past and present DOJ employees until DOJ shares its finding,\" such as whether he thinks Acosta should resign as labor secretary.\n\nCNN reporter Manu Raju added on Twitter that Sasse \"wouldn`t comment or take questions moments ago on whether Acosta should resign as Labor secretary.\"\n\nThe only other Republican senator to respond to INSIDER`s query was Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Chairman Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.

Ninety days after the legislative session ended, the state will roll out a professional licensing law that Gov. Doug Ducey has touted as a game-changing tool to make it easier to move to Arizona and work in a range of regulated fields, from cosmetology to real estate and optometry. Known as universal recognition, the policy was a central part of Ducey\u2019s legislative agenda this year and just one of several steps to roll back the power of state boards that oversee numerous skilled professions. The governor argues that those bodies have, at times, abused their power or gotten in the way of job-seekers.

Melina Maples-Granger, Maples\u2019 daughter, said Maples died Thursday in Little Rock from complications of congestive heart failure. Maples represented same-sex couples who challenged Arkansas\u2019 constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman. A county judge struck the amendment down in 2014, which led to more than 500 same-sex couples marrying before the ruling was suspended by the state Supreme Court. Justices didn\u2019t rule before the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in 2015.

(Photo: Rich Grant, Visit Denver)\n\nColorado Springs: The U.S. Air Force Academy has announced it will close its cadet chapel for extensive renovations beginning next month. KOAA-TV reports the military academy says Sept. 3 is the final day scheduled for visits prior to the chapel\u2019s three-year closure. Officials at the academy near Colorado Springs say a $158 million restoration and preservation project is scheduled to begin Nov. 1. Officials say work crews are expected to remove furniture and conduct other preparation work between Sept. 3 and Nov. 1. The chapel was originally scheduled to close in June, but the project was delayed.

Spraying will be conducted Monday at Mount Misery campground, the nearby horse camp, and roads leading from the main forest entrance to Hell Hollow Road. Spraying will begin at 7 p.m., weather permitting. It will continue overnight, and roads will be closed to vehicular traffic. The state\u2019s mosquito management program, an interagency response to mosquito-borne diseases, says there\u2019s a high concentration of mosquitoes in the area infected with Eastern equine encephalitis virus and West Nile virus. The state is using a pesticide called Anvil. Officials say the location is not a residential area, and those living in surrounding areas do not need to take precautions during the spraying.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A high-profile case of a doctor convicted of raping and abusing more than 85 children has led to major changes in how the state investigates and disciplines doctors. Since Earl Bradley\u2019s arrest in 2009, 178 Delaware doctors have received some form of disciplinary action from the state. In the decade before that, licensing records show only 48 doctors were disciplined by the state. Bradley\u2019s ability to keep practicing exposed several failures in how the state\u2019s medical community reported and disciplined doctors. The case led to the General Assembly passing a series of laws, one of which made it easier to suspend the license of a doctor who poses a \u201cclear and immediate danger.\u201d\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: As D.C. kids get ready to go back to school Monday, some have more to worry about than the grades, WUSA-TV reports.

(Photo: Riviera Nayarit Convention & Visitors Bureau)\n\nMarathon: A non-native, juvenile olive ridley sea turtle has been released off the Florida Keys. Officials say the 30-pound turtle named Harry was released Thursday with a small satellite transmitter affixed to the top of its shell. The electronic device should provide tracking data to help marine biologists gain insights into the reptile\u2019s movements in unfamiliar territory, before it detaches in two to six months. Harry was rescued by recreational boaters in early February, entangled in a large fishing net, off the Upper Keys. Emaciated and near death, the reptile was transported to the Florida Keys-based Turtle Hospital for treatment. Hospital officials say olive ridley turtles typically live in the southern Atlantic and Pacific oceans. They say only six olive ridleys have been documented in Florida waters.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A new report says the state\u2019s public colleges and universities had an economic impact worth $17.7 billion statewide during the 2018 fiscal year.

It credited Georgia\u2019s public colleges with creating 168,284 jobs \u2013 70% of which were off-campus positions in the private and public sector. The annual study was conducted by University of Georgia economist Jeffrey Humphreys. The latest report covers the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2018.

The Star-Advertiser reports the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration analyzed ocean temperatures across the islands and found they\u2019ve risen by 3 degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists say coral bleaching has occurred before, but they are already seeing worse signs at Kealakekua Bay on Hawaii island and at Kaneohe Bay and Hanauma Bay on Oahu. Experts say coral bleaching is a change from normal coloration of browns, yellows and greens to a nearly white color because of increased exposure to environmental stressors, including temperature increases. Scientists say coral reefs are important for marine habitats; have cultural, recreational and economic benefits; and also provide protection for coastal shorelines during storms.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state must provide gender confirmation surgery to a transgender inmate who has been living as a woman for years but has continuously been housed in a men\u2019s prison, a federal appeals court said Friday. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with a federal judge in Idaho that the state\u2019s denying the surgery for 31-year-old Adree Edmo amounted to cruel and unusual punishment, a violation of the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Under the ruling, Edmo would become the first Idaho inmate to receive gender confirmation surgery while in Idaho Department of Correction custody. \u201cThis is a complete win for Ms. Edmo,\u201d said her attorney, Lori Rifkin. \u201cOur client is immensely relieved and grateful that the court recognized her basic right to medical treatment.\u201d Republican Gov.

The agency says three consecutive days of tests came out positive, including two days with no detection of cyanide. The government says samples were taken by Indiana environmental regulators and ArcelorMittal and reviewed by independent labs. The Park Service had closed the Portage Lakefront and Riverwalk beach areas at Indiana Dunes National Park. Fish were killed. ArcelorMittal says the spill occurred after its Burns Harbor mill had a failure at a blast furnace water recirculation system. Wastewater containing elevated levels of ammonia and cyanide was released in the Little Calumet River\u2019s east branch. The company has apologized.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Google gave two local nonprofits $175,000 on Friday through the company\u2019s Impact Challenge Iowa grant program.

Swatting involves someone making a hoax emergency call to send law enforcement officers, particularly SWAT teams, to a particular address. The program announced Friday is voluntary and open to people who think they might become victims of swatting. The alerts would be available to first responders. Officer Paul Cruz says the alerts wouldn\u2019t slow emergency responders but would make them aware they might be responding to a hoax call. In 2017, Wichita police fatally shot Andrew Finch after a caller falsely claimed a murder and hostage situation was occurring at his home.

A Wednesday memo said three engines, one truck and one battalion chief will respond to alarms starting Sept. 1, down from the five engines, two trucks, two battalion chiefs and one medic unit that\u2019s considered a full assignment. Seventeen personnel will respond, still higher than the National Fire Protection Association standard of 15. Chief Niles R.

One commenter suggested the guilty party rebuild it at no cost in addition to facing criminal charges. Another said that it\u2019s \u201csad that the actions of a few people can ruin it for so many.\u201d\n\nMinnesota\n\nPark Point Beach on Lake Superior in Duluth, Minn., is among the few spots in the area that offer soft sands. (Photo: Pete Markham / Flickr)\n\nDuluth: The ever-present danger of rip currents in Lake Superior has some people in Duluth calling for more to be done to improve public safety. Retired police officer Dennis Hoelscher tells Minnesota Public Radio News that lifeguard services need to be improved. Lifeguards don\u2019t work on \u201cred flag\u201d days that have high risk of rip currents. Hoelscher and others think guards should work on those days, work longer hours in general, work more beaches and be trained to work in big waves. The Duluth YMCA, which runs the lifeguard program on Park Point, says posting lifeguards misleads people to think it\u2019s safe. And expanding services is difficult in what is currently mostly a break-even arrangement. MPR reports communities across the Great Lakes struggle with how to pay for lifeguards.\n\nMississippi\n\nColumbus: Officials say the city was on its way into debt but has turned its finances around, saving about $805,000 since March. The Commercial Dispatch reports Mayor Robert Smith told councilmen last week that the city saved about $329,000 while adding $476,000 to unbudgeted revenue. Accountant Mike Crowder in March told the city it\u2019d be more than $300,000 in debt by September if spending continued. Smith says several decisions helped the city save, like freezes on hiring and wages, upping the employee health insurance deductible from $100 to $500, and opening the court clerk\u2019s office on Fridays, which collected $26,206 in additional fees. Smith says the city had $7 million in its coffers, including about $2 million in the operating funds. It\u2019s unclear whether the fund will finish the fiscal year at a deficit.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Authorities say a shirtless man reportedly dragging a topless, unconscious woman through downtown was actually lugging around a life-size doll.

One caller said he was yelling \u201csavior\u201d while holding the woman.

The Nebraska Supreme Court upheld the decision of regulators who voted in November 2017 to greenlight a route through the state. The court\u2019s decision was a victory for the $8 billion project, which has been mired in lawsuits and regulatory hearings since it was proposed in 2008. Despite the victory for Canada-based TC Energy, opponents vowed Friday that the legal fight to block construction was far from over. \u201cThe risky pipeline project\u2019s fate is still very much in doubt, as three separate federal lawsuits continue to proceed that challenge the controversial project\u2019s permits,\u201d leading pipeline opposition group Bold Alliance said in a statement.\n\nNevada\n\nSteve Rahn and Catherine Clinckemaillie of Fort St. John, British Columbia, get a close look at a mounted polar bear at the Safari Club International`s Hunters Convention at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center in 2000.

The sportsman\u2019s club is ending its initial three-year agreement with the Biggest Little City a year early. The 2020 convention will continue in Reno in February. The club hasn\u2019t officially announced the venue change, but the move has been confirmed by the Reno Sparks Convention and Visitors Authority. RSCVA Board Chairman Bob Lucy says it\u2019s disappointing, but the board continues to have a good relationship with the club and hopes it returns someday. Safari Club returned to Reno this year following a five-year absence and declining attendance in Las Vegas. The RSCVA says this year\u2019s convention generated an estimated $20 million in economic impact for the Reno-Tahoe area, including more than 17,000 room nights for the region\u2019s hotels.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A year after Gov. Chris Sununu\u2019s unsuccessful push to prolong school summer vacation until Labor Day, the vast majority of the state\u2019s communities are sticking with their earlier start dates. Schools in 80% of districts will be starting before Labor Day this year. While four districts that started earlier last year will now start after Labor Day, two other districts went the other way. Sununu, a Republican, created a \u201cSave Our Summers Study Commission\u201d last August to explore a mandatory post-Labor Day start date. The group issued a report without taking sides, though it emphasized the economic benefits. Subsequent legislation to enact a mandate, however, was retained in the Senate Education Committee for reconsideration next year. Businesses tied to tourism support later start dates, while teachers oppose the idea.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nThe Daily Targum at Rutgers University will no longer have a print edition on Fridays.

Bloomfield launched an online fundraiser asking for help coming up with $467,000 it owes the American Civil Liberties Union lawyers after courts ruled against the city. Officials say the ACLU represented several residents who said the monument violated their First Amendment rights. Officials say the city owes lawyers $700,000 by June 30, 2021, and has already paid more than $200,000. Anything not raised will be paid for using the gross receipts tax and is currently budgeted.

The name River Pigs was chosen to reflect the region\u2019s logging history. River pigs were skilled loggers who broke up logjams on rivers. But when the team was announced in late July, some Tupper Lake residents said the name \u201cPigs\u201d sounded demeaning. Fire Chief Royce Cole says the village baseball committee will discuss other options over the weekend. The team is slated to arrive in Tupper Lake next summer.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: State election officials on Friday certified bar code ballots for use in elections starting next year despite an outcry that they can\u2019t be trusted by voters uncertain their choices are accurately counted. The State Board of Elections voted 3-2 to allow a voting-machine maker to sell equipment that digitizes votes into bar code data, which is then tallied by the company\u2019s counting machines. Almost two dozen speakers urged the elections board to reject bar code systems because voters can\u2019t read the bar codes to check that they\u2019re correct. But Democratic board chairman Damon Circosta sided with two Republicans on the five-member panel, citing the risk of delay after touchscreen-only equipment is disallowed in December. New voting machines in about a quarter of the state\u2019s counties need to be replaced as primary elections loom in March.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBuilt in 1883 using state-of-the-art construction methods, the majestic Bismarck-Mandan Rail Bridge was the first to span the Upper Missouri River.

(Photo: Andrew Selsky/AP)\n\nSalem: After two walkouts this year by minority Republican senators in the Legislature, Democrats say they\u2019ll ask voters to change quorum rules, allowing the Statehouse to convene with only a simple majority of lawmakers present instead of the current two-thirds requirement. The boycotts by the Republicans prevented the Senate from convening. Democrats dropped proposals on gun control and vaccines, and Democratic Gov. Kate Brown ordered state police to bring the missing lawmakers back during the second walkout. The Republicans left the state to avoid apprehension and returned only after a sweeping bill to combat global warming was moot. Senate Democrats said Majority Leader Ginny Burdick will introduce a constitutional amendment next year to lower quorum requirements.

It will include adjusting the channel, stabilizing the banks, removing debris, restoring native vegetation and installing a boat ramp. The river suffered from decades of pollution from industry and a landfill. The city launched the restoration project in 2015, and the upcoming work will be the fourth of seven planned phases. The city and the Two Fly Foundation, a fly-fishing group, started an annual volunteer cleanup day for the river in 2005.

He argued in a 2016 National Review article that the \"Founding Fathers intended all lands owned by the federal government to be sold.\"\n\nPendley suggested those views have little bearing on his new post, adding that he`s now in an administration that \"adamantly opposes\" the wholesale sale and transfer of public lands.\n\n\"I understand the chain of command. I understand and know how to follow orders,\" Pendley told Montana radio station KBUL-AM. \"I get it, so whatever I`ve said and done in the past is irrelevant.\"\n\nWestern ranchers had welcomed his appointment as evidence that the administration was serious about opening public land to all uses. But it has raised alarm among conservationists, who said it signaled a willingness within the Trump administration to start selling off federal lands.\n\nTracy Stone-Manning, vice president for public lands at the National Wildlife Federation, rejected Pendley`s claim that his past views were no longer an issue.\n\n\"Mr. Pendley clearly has disdain for our public lands and now he`s going to be managing them,\" Stone-Manning said. \"He is bringing a personal value set and a personal belief that public lands have no business being public, which sets him up to fail.\"\n\nGet the Breaking News newsletter!

They`ve also downsized two national monuments in Utah to scale back protections on sacred tribal lands.\n\nIn the radio interview, Pendley said \"Trump is committed to developing all the lands.\"\n\nYet the administration`s critics could not point to any major sales of federal lands to outside entities in the 19 months since the Republican took office.\n\nInterior Department spokeswoman Molly Block said two of Pendley`s initial acts involved land acquisitions, not sales: the first piece of a planned 20.3-square-mile (52.6-square-kilometer) purchase near Montana`s Lower Blackfoot River and 17.4 square miles (45.1 square kilometers) along Oregon`s John Day River.\n\nPerry previously worked as a midlevel Interior Department appointee during the Reagan administration. More recently he led a conservative law firm, the Mountain States Legal Foundation, and championed private companies and ranchers in standoffs with the federal government over grazing and other uses of public lands.\n\nSome legal disputes he was involved with are ongoing, including an attempt to drill for oil and gas in Montana`s Badger-Two Medicine area, which is adjacent to Montana`s Glacier National Park and considered sacred among the Blackfoot tribes of the U.S. and Canada.\n\nU.S. Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, asked Pendley to recuse himself from the dispute and all others involving his former law firm and the Interior Department. Pendley has yet to respond, Tester press secretary Roy Loewenstein said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Matthew Brown at https://twitter.com/matthewbrownap Agency boss: Past support for US land sales is `irrelevant` 8-2019", "doc_id": "d7042d9d-2e5a-4169-9528-aa03b6e52197", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "76ff81b50331b86085cbf33534cb796981a292ce635ddc7fcef7a7ebf26e8079", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3739, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "364d5f5c-b6f1-4af3-83b2-95dd3999be76"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c62a81c8-e557-47cd-b1ea-e4e7ee7eb26b": {"__data__": {"text": "Charlie Palmer Steak\n\nSpending: At least $1.3 million\n\nCharlie Palmer, one of the closest high-end spots to the Capitol, has a roof deck that offers unobstructed views of the Capitol\u2019s dome and the Washington Monument.

Sign up here to receive it every weekday morning.\n\n(CNN) Rarely has a global corporation as respected and powerful as Boeing been so humbled.\n\nDeep political connections that normally grease the airplane maker`s way in Washington meant nothing on Tuesday, as its CEO endured a fearsome dressing-down on the anniversary of last year`s Lion Air crash. For once, the US Congress did its job famously, as lawmakers finally stumbled on an issue that both Republicans and Democrats care about, not to mention millions of airline passengers around the world.\n\nWatched by bereaved relatives in a Senate committee room, CEO Dennis Muilenburg gave the clearest mea culpa yet for crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia -- both involving Boeing`s 737 Max jet -- that killed 346 people. \"We understand and deserve this scrutiny,\" said Muilenburg, who insisted he wouldn`t resign.\n\nThe impact of the twin disasters went beyond the human toll. Faults in Boeing`s safety record were exposed by the jet`s new anti-stall software, as were revelations it had known about problems and failed to properly alert airlines and pilots. The Federal Aviation Administration`s failure to catch glaring issues has also rocked confidence in what were once the gold standards of global flight safety.\n\nAmerican presidents often preside over huge airliner deals during foreign trips, and the Seattle-based firm was once a tool of US soft power. Now its woes are dragging American economic growth and boosting European archrival Airbus. And whenever Boeing`s fixes allow the 737 Max to take wing again, foreign regulators won`t rely on the FAA to certify it as airworthy -- another blow to US prestige.\n\nCan the ill-fated jet, the people who made it and the American institutions behind them win back global public confidence? As Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana put it: \"I would walk before I would get on a 737 Max.\"\n\nImpeachment today, in brief\n\nWe`ve said it before and we`ll say it again: Today was a blockbuster day in impeachment.\n\nDemocrats think they have a killer witness. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the first current West Wing official to testify, was on the now-notorious call between Trump and Ukraine`s President, and said he was so alarmed by what he had heard that he twice tried to warn superiors.\n\nOne way to tell Vindman`s testimony was significant: Conservative media commentators launched a smear campaign. Several questioned the patriotism of the wounded Iraq War veteran, who was born in Soviet Ukraine before fleeing to the US as a refugee.\n\nDemocrats unveiled a resolution setting down the rules and future scope of their investigation ahead of a Rules Committee vote on Wednesday, to send the measure to a historic full House of Representatives vote the next day. It`s the first formal move towards impeaching Trump.\n\nMeanwhile in Beirut\n\nA supporter of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri burns garbage containers to block a main road in Beirut, Lebanon, Tuesday, Oct. 29, 2019.\n\nCNN`s Ben Wedeman writes to Meanwhile from Beirut:\n\n\"Anti-government protesters cheered the resignation of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Al-Hariri`s government on Tuesday. Hariri had been caught between the rock of mass, nationwide demonstrations and the hard place of his (barely) unity government -- and when promises of reform didn`t take the edge off the protests, he saw no other way out. With no clear successor in place, Hariri will now likely lead a caretaker government, which will be hobbled in its ability to deal with the country`s impending economic collapse.\n\n\"Meanwhile, Hezbollah supporters have attacked Beirut`s anti-government protesters twice in the past five days. Already feeling the pinch from US sanctions on Iran and itself, the party is believed to have been alarmed to find that many of its working class Shia constituents joined the anti-government protests.

Others are selling \u201cpragmatism,\u201d with more modest ideas meant to win consensus \u2014 and which are often quite liberal by historical standards . But nearly everyone on the board faces the same, fundamental problem: They want to go further than where Congress, and the Senate in particular, will want to move, even if it has a Democratic majority.\n\nRight now, the Senate Democratic caucus is 47 members strong \u2014 45 Democrats and two independents. Twelve are up for re-election. If Democrats somehow sweep the field next year \u2014 if they save every incumbent, win every tossup and flip every seat that only leans Republican, they\u2019ll have a 54-member majority. In this hypothetical majority, at least three members \u2014 Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Jon Tester of Montana and Doug Jones of Alabama \u2014 will come from conservative, pro-Trump states. And there will be new members from competitive, Republican-leaning states like Iowa, Arizona and Georgia.\n\nA Democratic president might have 46 liberal-to-left-wing votes for her agenda. Even without the filibuster, this agenda would rest with relatively conservative Democrats like Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Sinema, Politico reports, has distanced herself from her liberal colleagues, won\u2019t commit to supporting the Democratic nominee for president, backs the supermajority requirement for legislation \u2014 otherwise known as the legislative filibuster \u2014 and hopes to restore the supermajority requirement for judicial and executive branch nominations.\n\nIn this best-case scenario, the next Democratic president will have to work with a Senate that has bound itself by rules that preclude party-line legislation. That president might be able to build a workaround \u2014 Senator Sanders has proposed passing a Medicare-for-All bill through the budget reconciliation process, which requires only a simple majority, but he would still have to deal with a caucus whose pivotal votes are well to the right of the White House. For anything else \u2014 like immigration reform or climate legislation \u2014 he\u2019d have to win six or seven conservative Republican votes. If this wasn\u2019t possible in 2009, in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, then it\u2019s ludicrous to think it will happen at any point in the near future.

A decorated senior chief boatswain\u2019s mate, he was deployed overseas six times, each for a year. In 2010, he saved two lives in a rocket attack and ground assault in Kandahar, Afghanistan.\n\nHis service took a toll. His marriage didn\u2019t survive. His children worried about him \u2014 a lot.\n\n\u201cI was gone for a year, home for a year, gone for a year, home for a year,\u201d he says. \u201cThe whole family paid a price for that.\u201d\n\nHis daughter, Paige Dotson, 22, says: \u201cI didn\u2019t see my dad for six years. I thought he was going to die.\u201d\n\nWhen the Navy told Dotson that, if he would re-enlist for another four years, he could transfer his Post-9/11 GI Bill educational benefit to Paige and her brother for college, he didn\u2019t hesitate. His children each would get two years of schooling paid, giving them a shot to be the first college graduates in their family.\n\nDotson, who\u2019s from Michigan, didn\u2019t know that the promised education would be yanked out from under them, that this gift would turn into debt-collection notices for his daughter amounting to $20,000 and growing.\n\nThe Dotsons are among military families on the hook for huge, unexpected bills for college they were promised would be covered by a government plan that for years has come under fire. Some children of veterans went to college, only to be told there was an error with their parents\u2019 applications, and the funds would be cut off.\n\n\u201cA lot of time, they don\u2019t even know something is wrong,\u201d says Vadim Panasyuk, a senior manager with the nonprofit organization Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.\n\nPanasyuk says he\u2019s heard from more than 40 families who were shocked to find their GI Bill benefits canceled. One family was told: You now owed the government $60,000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d he says. \u201cIt really ruins the financial stability of some of our longest-serving families. It\u2019s folks that gave their all for their country \u2014 their youth, their health, everything.\u201d\n\nThe Post-9/11 GI Bill, signed into law in 2008, covers veterans who served in the military after Sept. 11, 2001. It\u2019s meant to pay college tuition, books and housing for veterans, much like the post-World War II GI Bill that helped boost the middle class.\n\nBut there have been numerous complaints. Initially, much of the funding was going to for-profit colleges. Last year, some vets saw their housing payments delayed because of administrative glitches.\n\nBeing able to transfer the education benefit to your dependents has become a key retention tool for military services stretched thin by deployments. Branches have enticed service members to agree to re-enlist for four more years by offering the chance to pass the education benefit to a child or spouse.\n\nBut the rules have tripped up some families.\n\nIn Russell Dotson\u2019s case, his service record was beyond dispute. In 2010, while supporting a construction battalion in Kandahar during a ground assault and rocket attack on the base, he rushed to the site of an explosion, gave first aid to a NATO contractor, then used his bare hands to stanch the bleeding of a wounded Marine.\n\n\u201cHis quick reaction in the face of enemy fire was undoubtedly crucial in saving the life of the U.S. Marine and contractor,\u201d his superiors wrote of Dotson\u2019s \u201cdecisive and selfless actions.\u201d\n\nThen, nearing the end of what he\u2019d planned to have been his final four-year commitment \u2014 the re-enlistment he made to get the college benefit for his kids \u2014 Dotson, 51, says he met with his command\u2019s career counselor to make sure all of his years of service added up. He says he was told he was good to go.\n\nSoon after, his daughter enrolled in college in Chicago at", "doc_id": "b6d10e3a-13fe-41ef-97bf-62781889aa44", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ffe5a3adb8a1ff7bfcea10358eba874860a81f016b47a6a0961e4a7432c4ac5d", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3699, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "71cfae83-b6fd-438c-add3-fa5bf1fafc53", "3": "39e87c05-582c-4a5c-9585-c3e25f4f233f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "39e87c05-582c-4a5c-9585-c3e25f4f233f": {"__data__": {"text": "he was good to go.\n\nSoon after, his daughter enrolled in college in Chicago at DePaul University.\n\nEverything was going well until, toward the end of second quarter freshman year, the government stopped making payments to DePaul for her tuition and housing.\n\nEven worse, they told her she had to repay what already was paid \u2014 more than $20,000 including interest. She ended up having to transfer to the University of Michigan, where she could get in-state tuition but still is working three part-time jobs, in addition to getting loans.\n\nRussell Dotson says he learned, too late, that even though his command staff told him he could retire, the Defense Department used the date of his benefit-transfer application \u2014 rather than his re-enlistment date \u2014 to calculate his service time. That left him 89 days short.\n\nAs a reservist serving one weekend a month, that 89 days actually meant all he would have needed to qualify was six days of weekend service. He says he had plenty of unused \u201cauthorized absence\u201d days that could cover the six days \u2014 if Navy officials would switch his retirement date in their records. He says they have refused.\n\n\u201cThey made a math mistake,\u201d Dotson, now working as a corporate recruiter, says of the Navy staffer who advised him on what he needed. \u201cI owed them six damn days.\u201d\n\nHis uniform still fits. He says he would put it back on and serve the six days if the Navy would let him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have $20,000 to give back to the federal government,\u201d Dotson says. \u201cAnd my daughter doesn\u2019t, either. Yes, my career is my responsibility. I just want to fix it. It\u2019s six stupid days.\u201d\n\nRetired Lt. Col. Todd Grant got a similar shock after 23 years in the Air Force, including a final four-year re-enlistment so he could transfer his education benefit to his children. Grant, 49, a weapons system officer who lives in Virginia, was deployed seven times and flew more than 500 combat hours.\n\nAs a boy growing up in Rhode Island, he admired his three uncles who served in Vietnam and his grandfather, who served during World War II.\n\n\u201cI wanted to protect my fellow Americans; I wanted to do the right thing,\u201d Grant says of what military service means to him. \u201cI wanted to serve and protect the Constitution of the United States. That\u2019s important to me.\u201d\n\nHe hoped that helping his children be able to go to college would help make up for all the missed birthdays and Christmases.\n\n\u201cMilitary life isn\u2019t the easiest sometimes,\u201d Grant says.\n\nWhen Grant left the Air Force in 2016, the Defense Department confirmed in writing he had earned a total of four years of college to transfer to his children. But just as his son was entering the University of Central Florida last fall, the federal Department of Veterans Affairs said their funding was being cut \u2014 to just five months rather than four years of college \u2014 because Grant had gone to college in the 1990s under the previous GI Bill.\n\nGrant says he asked an Air Force counselor specifically about whether that would be an issue before he re-enlisted. \u201cThey said: \u2018Yes, you\u2019re eligible.\u2019 And I said: \u2018Are you sure?\u2019 And they said, \u2018Yes, you\u2019re eligible.\u2019 Being a good airman, I trusted my chain of command, and I trusted my service.\u201d\n\nNow, Grant wishes he would have not re-enlisted for those final four years, returned to civilian life, worked and saved for his college for his children.\n\n\u201cI know the rules have gotten really convoluted, and that\u2019s why I relied on the Air Force to tell me the real information,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to happen to anyone else.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to correct such errors after the fact, according to Panasyuk, from the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans\u2019 group.

You would think you could say, \u2018You guys failed me on this.\u2019 But they say, \u2018That\u2019s not our problem.\u2019 \u201d\n\nLast year, the government announced that as of July, service members who had served more than 16 years would no longer be able to transfer their benefit to dependents. That deadline was later extended to January 2020 amid complaints that the policy would penalize those who\u2019d served the longest, many of them who\u2019d delayed having children while they were off fighting wars.\n\nLegislation introduced in Congress in September by Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, Jon Tester, D-Montana, and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, aims to untangle some of the complex rules and make it easier for veterans to claim the educational benefits. Their proposed Post-9/11 GI Bill Transferability Entitlement Act would allow any service member who has completed at least 10 years to transfer benefits to their dependents at any time \u2014 while on active duty or as a veteran.\n\nThe bill has support from the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States and the Reserve Enlisted Association. Daniel Elkins, legislative director for the National Guard group, says the government needs to stop making service members jump through complicated hoops.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve served your country, and you should be able to transfer your benefit,\u201d Elkins says. \u201cWe don\u2019t think there should be a timeline on that.\u201d The Navy told him he served long enough to get his kids free college.
