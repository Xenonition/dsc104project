I`m Andy Sullivan in San Francisco, perhaps the most liberal city in the state where Republicans have been pushed to the margins. Tuesday could bring more bad news due to the state`s quirky election rules, Republicans could end up without a candidate for senator or governor in the fall elections.\\n\\nAnd that could cause trouble for other GOP candidates around the state. In most states, the primary election narrows down the field to one Democrat and one Republican. But in California`s so-called jungle primary, it`s the top two vote-getters in any given race who face each other in November, even if they`re from the same party.\\n\\nThat means incumbent Democratic Senator, Dianne Feinstein could face Democratic State Senator, Kevin De Leon, rather than a Republican. Republicans may be shut out in the governor`s race as well. GOP businessman man, John Cox has President Trump`s endorsement, but he may wind up in third place. That would lead two Democrats, former San Francisco Mayor, Gavin Newsom, and former Los Angeles Mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa to battle it out in the fall.\\n\\nWithout Republican candidates at the top of the ticket, conservative voters may not show up on election day. That could hurt Republican candidates in closely fought congressional races around the state, making it harder to retain control of the House of Representatives. Republicans now account for just one in four of the state`s registered voters and the party here is divided on issues like illegal immigration.\\n\\nCox backing a crack down, others like Congressman Jeff Denham, trying to protect the young immigrants known as dreamers as he appeals to a diverse population>> That means, making sure that we`ve got a secure border and also having a permanent fix for dreamers.>> Democrats says their voters are more energized than ever, but they`ve got problems of their own.', 'title': ' California GOP risks shutout in Tuesday vote ', 'publishdate': '6-2018'}\n",

That is not the leadership we need.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe letter does acknowledge that Schumer’s hands are tied to a large extent by the harsh realities of Senate math. Republicans need a simple majority and hold 51 Senate seats, meaning that Democrats are hoping that two Republicans -- namely moderate Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Susan Collins, R-Maine -- break ranks.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the letter indicates that the groups believe Schumer is not doing a good enough job whipping members to vote against Kavanaugh.\\n\\nKAVANAUGH AVOIDS DEM TRAPS AS CHAOTIC HEARING WINDS DOWN, CONFIRMATION VOTE LOOMS\\n\\n“If you hold your caucus together, you force them to have to make a real choice, with very real consequences for their constituents.

If they cast similar votes this month, then it won’t matter if some Republicans break away.\\n\\n\\n\\nRanking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., was also under fire in California, with her Democratic rival in November`s election, Kevin De Leon, accusing her of a “subpar\" performance.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You have a tale of very different approaches on the Judiciary Committee,” De Leon told The San Diego Union-Tribune. He also knocked Feinstein for criticizing the protestors at the confirmation, saying she should have supported them instead.\\n\\n\"The protesters at the #KavanaughConfirmation are patriots trying to protect the rights of every American threatened by this nominee,\" he tweeted. \"We need to support them and stand with them @SenFeinstein, not apologize for them. California deserves a senator who will #ResistNotAssist.\"\\n\\nDemand Justice Executive Director Brian Fallon offered his support for Harris while swiping at other Dems, saying that Harris had \"carried the Democrats\" in the first few days of the hearing.\\n\\n\"Can Harris be promoted to Ranking Member?\" the former Clinton aide tweeted.\\n\\nOn Friday, progressives indicated that Democrats hadn’t done enough again as three groups called for them to seek a perjury investigation over his testimony.\\n\\nPolitico reports that Demand Justice, MoveOn and NARAL Pro-Choice America claimed that a number of statements he made conflicted with testimony he made during the confirmation for his current court position.

Now Emily Doe, the anonymous woman then-Stanford University student Brock Turner sexually assaulted in 2015, is writing a memoir.\\n\\nDoe will \"reclaim the story of her sexual assault,\" publisher Viking Books said in a press release Wednesday.\\n\\n\"Emily Doe’s experience illuminates a culture built to protect perpetrators and a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable,\" said Viking editor-in-chief Andrea Schulz. \"The book will introduce readers to the writer whose words have already changed their world and move them with its accounting of her courage and resilience.\"\\n\\nActors Gabourey Sidibe, Freida Pinto and Amber Heard read the letter by \"Emily Doe\" on the Neuhouse Hollywood stage.

Doe put words to that experience, and implored us not to look away.\\n\\nHer 12-page statement on the assault, which she read in court before Turner`s sentencing, was published in full by Buzzfeed on June 3, 2015. Within four days, it had been viewed 11 million times.\\n\\nParts of it were chillingly raw: \"I learned that my ass and vagina were completely exposed outside, my breasts had been groped, fingers had been jabbed inside me along with pine needles and debris.\" Other sections were painfully eloquent: \"I wanted to take off my body like a jacket and leave it at the hospital with everything else.\"\\n\\nTurner was convicted of assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated/unconscious person, penetration of an intoxicated person and penetration of an unconscious person. He faced up to 14 years in prison but was sentenced to six months in county jail.
