"Trump made 22 of the false claims at a campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania. He made 16 of them in a lengthy exchange with reporters during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.

The economy was Trump`s top subject of dishonesty, with 25 false claims. He made 22 false claims about military affairs, largely on account of his presence at a NATO summit. He made 15 false claims about NATO itself, 11 about impeachment.

Trump is now averaging 63 false claims per week since we started counting at CNN on July 8, 2019. He made 38 false claims last week, 61 the week before.

He is now up to 1,450 total false claims since July 8. A breakdown of the lowlights from the last two weeks:

The most egregious false claim: An imaginary restraining order

Trump has no shortage of factual ammunition for bashing former FBI senior counterintelligence official Peter Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who exchanged anti-Trump texts while being involved in the investigation into the Trump campaign`s relationship with Russia (and while having an affair).

But Trump is rarely satisfied with accurate attacks when he can do more damage to his foes` reputations with inaccurate ones. At his December 10 campaign rally in Pennsylvania, he alleged that one of either Strzok or Page had obtained a restraining order against the other.

Most presidents try to limit their public storytelling to stories they know to be accurate. Not Trump, an eager purveyor of rumor and insinuation, he told the crowd: ""I don`t know if it`s true. The fake news will never report it. But it could be true. No, that`s what I heard, I don`t know.""

There is not a hint of evidence that the story is true. Page tweeted that it was a ""lie.""

The most revealing false claim: An assault in Maryland

Trump comes to many of his rally speeches armed with graphic accounts of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. At the Pennsylvania rally, he recited accurate details of a horrifying recent Maryland case during which a man allegedly strangled and raped a woman who was trying to enter her apartment.

Then, appearing to ad-lib for a moment, Trump said, ""She was raped and killed, strangled to death.""

The victim was not killed. Police reported that doctors said she could have been killed by the strangulation, but she survived

We might be inclined to think Trump had made an innocent error had he not done this kind of needless exaggerating before. At one event last year, for example, he began to read out his text`s accurate claim that the MS-13 gang on Long Island, New Yorkhad called for the murder of a police officer, then decided to turn it into a false claim that MS-13 actually did murder the police officer.

The most absurd false claim: Rewriting campaign history

Trump`s general approach to history: if you don`t like it, rewrite it.

The Louisiana governor candidate for whom Trump campaigned hard, Eddie Rispone, lost to incumbent John Bel Edwards by 2.7 percentage points. Trump claimed twice this month that Rispone lost by less than one percentage point.

And that was not the month`s most egregious attempt to revise his political past. At the NATO summit, Trump told reporters that, with the exception of that race in Louisiana and another governor`s race in Kentucky, ""I`ve won virtually every race that I`ve participated in.""

""Virtually"" is vague, but Trump was wrong however you slice things. He was omitting the defeats of two Alabama Senate candidates he had touted at rallies in 2017, a Virginia governor candidate he had repeatedly tweeted to promote in 2017, and a Pennsylvania congressional candidate and Montana and West Virginia Senate candidates he had promoted at rallies in 2018.

Here`s the full list of 99 false claims, starting with the new ones we haven`t previously included in one of these roundups:

Foreign and military affairs

The Turkey-Syria border

""We pulled our soldiers out and we said, `You can patrol your own border now. I don`t care who you do it with, but we`re not going to have soldiers patrolling the border that`s been fought over for 2,000 years.`"" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron

""And I read a couple of stories just two days ago that, `Wow, that deal that Trump did with Turkey` -- because I want to get our soldiers out of there. I don`t want to be policing a border that`s been fought over for 2,000 years."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

Facts First: There is no basis for the claim that there has been fighting over the Turkey-Syria border for 2,000 years; modern-day Turkey and Syria were both part of the Ottoman Empire that was only dissolved after World War, and the border between them is less than 100 years old.

""The border he refers to -- the Turkish-Syria border -- was established in 1923 with the Treaty of Lausanne and the founding of the Republic of Turkey. The exception to this is the province of Hatay, which passed from Syrian to Turkish control following a referendum,"" said Lisel Hintz, assistant professor of international relations and European studies at Johns Hopkins, who called Trump`s claims ""patently and irresponsibly false."" Of the current conflict between Turkey and Kurdish groups based in Turkey and in Syria, Hintz added, ""Not only have these groups not been fighting over a border for 2,000 years, none of these groups or even the border in question existed 200 years ago.""

Augusta University history professor Michael Bishku said ""Trump is totally incorrect with his history.""

Germany`s military spending

""...Germany is paying 1 to 1.2% -- at max, 1.2% -- of a much smaller GDP. That`s not fair."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

Facts First: Trump`s ""max"" figure for Germany`s defense spending was out of date. While Germany did spend 1.24% its gross domestic product (GDP) on defense in 2018, according to NATO : Trump`s ""max"" figure for Germany`s defense spending was out of date. While Germany did spend 1.24% its gross domestic product (GDP) on defense in 2018, according to NATO figures , Chancellor Angela Merkel`s government increased defense spending in 2019 to an estimated 1.38% of GDP, according to NATO -- still shy of the alliance`s 2% target, but higher than Trump said.

Trump might have simply been unaware of the German increase, but it also appeared in NATO`s official report in June. (At that point, the alliance estimated that Germany would be at 1.36% of GDP this year.)

Military spending by NATO members, part 1

On 10 separate instances, Trump made inaccurate claims about increases in military spending by NATO members. He claimed that: 1) He ""got NATO countries to pay 530 Billion Dollars a year more."" 2) This increase in NATO spending will recur on an annual basis. 3) The increase will be $400 billion in ""three years.""

Facts First: Trump was inaccurate in all three ways. NATO says that, by 2024, non-US members will have spent a total of $400 billion more on defense than they did in 2016 -- not that they will be spending $400 billion more ""a year."" Trump`s math was faulty when he added the $130 billion current increase over 2016 levels to the $400 billion increase expected by 2024; the $400 billion figure includes the $130 billion. And, again, the $400 billion increase is expected by 2024, not in ""three years.""

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg explained during a meeting with Trump on December 3 that non-US NATO members have added a total of $130 billion to their defense budgets since 2016. By 2024, Stoltenberg said, ""this number will increase to $400 billion.""

NATO has made clear in public documents and statements that the $400 billion figure represents the planned cumulative spending increase for non-US members since 2016; NATO is not saying that these countries will be spending $400 billion more every year, as Trump suggested. NATO spokesman Matthias Eichenlaub pointed CNN to November comments in which Stoltenberg said that the $400 billion was an ""accumulated increase in defense spending by the end of 2024.""

We won`t call Trump wrong when he takes credit for the spending increases, since Stoltenberg himself has repeatedly given him credit , but it`s worth noting that non-US members began boosting their defense budgets following Russia`s 2014 annexation of Ukraine`s Crimea and a 2014 NATO recommitment to the alliance`s target of having each member spend 2% of Gross Domestic Product on defense.

Military spending by NATO members, part 2

""In the 3 decades before my election, NATO spending declined by two-thirds..."" -- December 2 tweet

Facts First: There are numerous possible ways to interpret Trump`s vague claim, but we could not find any way to parse the data that resulted in a finding that ""NATO spending declined by two-thirds"" over the three decades prior to Trump`s election in 2016. Neither could two experts we asked to delve into the numbers.

""Short answer, this tweet makes no sense to me, and I don`t see any evidence backing up this `decline by two thirds` business,"" said Timothy Andrews Sayle, author of the book Enduring Alliance: A History of NATO and the Postwar Global Order and an assistant professor of history and director of the international relations program at the University of Toronto.

Expert Pieter Wezeman, senior researcher in the arms and military expenditure program at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, noted that Trump might have been closer to correct had he said that the share of gross domestic product that European NATO members spent on defense declined by two-thirds in the three decades before his election. According to official NATO data , European NATO members were spending an average of 3.7% GDP on defense between 1980 and 1984 and 3.5% in 1986; the figure had dropped to about 1.5% in 2016, a reduction at least in the general vicinity of ""two-thirds.""

But, again, Trump did not say the more-accurate version of the claim. And when you crunch the actual military spending by NATO members in various ways -- we won`t delve into all of the possible ways the experts said Trump`s comment could be interpreted -- there was nowhere near a two-thirds decline, both experts found.

Accounting for inflation, official NATO data shows a decline well under one-third in military spending by non-US members between 1989, as the Cold War with the Soviet Union neared an end, and 2016. (NATO noted that additional countries were added to the alliance over that period, so it is not an apples-to-apples comparison.) Wezeman analyzed the data using only the NATO countries that were part of the alliance in 1986 and still found an inflation-adjusted decrease of well under one-third.

CNN`s coverage of Middle East protests

Trump said that, after he announced in 2017 that he would move the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, ""A day went by, and a second day went by, and there was no violence. I heard there was going to be massive violence. They showed violence -- because about 20 people were violent in the front row, but there was nobody behind them. So CNN had the cameras very low, pointing to the sky ... They said, `Massive crowds have gathered. Massive crowds.` And I looked, I said, `That`s a strange angle. I`ve never seen that angle.` It was like -- you had a cameraman sitting on the floor pointing up. But every once in a while, you say, `There`s nobody behind the people in the front row. What`s going on?` And it was a con. It was fake news as usual."" -- December 7 speech to the Israeli American Council National Summit

Facts First: CNN`s coverage of these 2017 protests did not use deceptive camera angles or exaggerate the size of the crowds. (FactCheck.org, which conducted its own : CNN`s coverage of these 2017 protests did not use deceptive camera angles or exaggerate the size of the crowds. (FactCheck.org, which conducted its own in-depth review of CNN`s coverage, also found no evidence for Trump`s claims.)

It is possible Trump was referring to a CNN report from the West Bank on December 7, 2017, the day after Trump`s announcement about the embassy. The camera bobbed upward and downward during the last portion of segment -- but only because the photojournalist carrying the camera was running from tear gas being used by Israeli forces.

CNN reporter Ian Lee, who now works for CBS, said in the report that ""you are seeing a lot of people go out in the street and voice their anger,"" but Lee did not describe the crowds as ""massive."" CNN`s article on the day`s protests, written by Lee and two others, included the following sentences: ""Speaking in Jerusalem, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told CNN that protests there were relatively small and had been largely contained. `We`ve dealt with much larger, both in terms of number, scale, size, seriousness of incidents.`""

In a December 12, 2017, report on subsequent West Bank protests, CNN senior international correspondent Arwa Damon said, ""The number of Palestinians who have taken to the streets remains, relatively speaking, low."" She said that the clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces were ""in fact, a little muted, at least by what the expectations were.""

Trump is correct that there was not major violence at protests immediately following his December 2017 announcement, but there was at protests on the day the Jerusalem embassy was officially opened in May 2018. The New York Times reported that day: ""By late in the evening, 58 Palestinians, including several teenagers, had been killed and more than 1,350 wounded by gun fire, the (Israeli) Health Ministry said. Israeli soldiers and snipers used barrages of tear gas as well as live gunfire to keep protesters from entering Israeli territory. The Israeli military said that some in the crowds were planting or hurling explosives, and that many were flying flaming kites into Israel; at least one kite outside the Nahal Oz kibbutz, near Gaza City, ignited a wildfire.""

Impeachment

Adam Schiff`s comments and defamation law

""This guy is sick. He made up the conversation. He lied. If he didn`t do that in the halls of Congress, he`d be thrown into jail. But he did it in the halls of Congress, and he`s given immunity."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

Facts First: Trump was correct that Rep. Adam Schiff : Trump was correct that Rep. Adam Schiff has legal immunity under the Constitution for comments he made at a House committee meeting in September about Trump`s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. (We`ve written that those comments were at least confusing .) However, Trump was wrong when he said Schiff would be ""thrown into jail"" if he had made these comments outside of Congress.

Let`s temporarily set aside the question of the accuracy or inaccuracy of Schiff`s remarks. Apart the fact that it would be exceedingly unusual for an elected official to be criminally prosecuted for offering a rendition of the President`s comments, even an inaccurate rendition, there is no law under which Schiff might conceivably be charged: as PolitiFact noted , there is no criminal defamation law in Washington, D.C. (where Schiff was speaking), in California (Schiff`s home state), or in federal law.

A quote from Fox News, part 1

""`The Democrats haven`t come up with a smocking (sic.) gun. Nancy Pelosi, by raising this to the level of Impeachment, has raised the bar impossibly high. This comes after three years of nonstop investigations of Trump, the Russian collusion narrative, the Mueller Report, & now the American people are supposed to believe that this simply isn`t a part of everthing (sic.) they`ve been trying to do for the last three years? I think it is really a hard sell for Nancy Pelosi.` @DanHenninger The Wall Street Journal."" -- December 8 tweet

Facts First: Trump omitted the portion of Henninger`s : Trump omitted the portion of Henninger`s comments on Fox News in which Henninger said things less favorable to Trump -- such as that the House of Representatives could have voted to censure him for trying to get Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden. In between the sentences Trump quoted, Henninger said, ""Everyone can agree or disagree about the rightness or wrongness of what Donald Trump did with the president of Ukraine, intervening, trying to get him to investigate Joe Biden. And indeed that`s a voteable issue; voters can make up their minds about that, and indeed the House could have voted to censure Donald Trump, the will of the House being that this is wrong.""

We give Trump significant latitude to make errors when quoting people on television, but we call it a false claim when he alters the meaning of the quote with major changes or omissions.

A quote from Fox News, part 2

""`The American people are going to see this for what it is. It is a political effort by the Democrats, and the President certainly doesn`t have to aid in the Impeachment effort.` Robert Ray @MariaBartiromo"" -- December 2 tweet

Facts First: Trump again omitted an unfavorable and significant part of the quote. This time, he left out Ray saying that Democrats may (or may not) be correct that impeachment will help their chances in the 2020 election.

Here`s what Ray said on Fox News, with the key Trump omission in italics: ""I think the American people are going to see this for what it is. I think they do understand at bottom that this is a political effort. The Democrats have made a calculation that this is their best way forward in order to maximize their chances in the 2020 election. They may be right or they may be wrong about that, that remains to be seen. But the President certainly doesn`t have to aid in the Impeachment effort.""

Elections

The Louisiana governor race

""And after getting them into a runoff, he picked up 14 points because they thought he was going to lose to a popular governor -- John Bel Edwards. Good guy. Popular governor. He almost won. He lost by less than a point."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

""And Louisiana was a long shot. It was less than 1%. He came up 12 or 14 points -- a lot."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

Facts First: Republican Eddie Rispone lost the Louisiana governor race to Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards by : Republican Eddie Rispone lost the Louisiana governor race to Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards by about 2.7 percentage points , 51.33% to 48.67%, not by ""less than a point"" or ""less than 1%.""

(In addition, Trump`s claim that Rispone had gained 12 or 14 points is highly questionable. Trump may have been referring to a single poll, a month before the vote, that had Rispone down 16 points, but most polls had the race in the single digits.)

Trump`s campaign history

""But with the exception of those two races (in Louisiana and Kentucky), where I had a huge impact because I raised them up almost to victory and they had no chance -- with the exception of those two, I`ve won virtually every race that I`ve participated in."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

Facts First: Though many of the Republican candidates for whom Trump has campaigned have gone on to win, it`s not true that Trump has won ""virtually every race"" in which he has participated. The following candidates were all defeated after Trump touted them at campaign rallies: Alabama Republican Senate primary candidate : Though many of the Republican candidates for whom Trump has campaigned have gone on to win, it`s not true that Trump has won ""virtually every race"" in which he has participated. The following candidates were all defeated after Trump touted them at campaign rallies: Alabama Republican Senate primary candidate Luther Strange in 2017, Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore in 2017 after he beat Strange in the primary, Pennsylvania Republican congressional candidate Rick Saccone in 2018, Montana Republican Senate candidate Matt Rosendale in 2018 and West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey in 2018.

Virginia Republican governor candidate Ed Gillespie also lost in 2017 after Trump tweeted repeatedly to promote him.

The Mueller investigation

""An overthrow of government""

""This was an overthrow of government. This was an attempted overthrow. And a lot of people who were in on it, and they got caught. They got caught red-handed."" -- December 9 remarks at roundtable on school choice

Facts First: There is no evidence that the FBI`s investigation into the Trump campaign`s relationship with Russia was an ""attempted overthrow"" of Trump.

Michael Horowitz, inspector general for the Justice Department, found ""basic and fundamental errors"" in the FBI`s handling of applications for surveillance of former Trump campaign foreign policy aide Carter Page under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Horowitz emphasized the seriousness of these mistakes in his December report and congressional testimony.

But Horowitz did not find evidence that the department or the FBI in particular were attempting some sort of coup -- nor even that there had been intentional misconduct. Horowitz found that the FBI had a legitimate basis to open the investigation into the Trump campaign`s relationship with Russia and that the decisions to investigate the campaign and individual campaign aides were not driven by political bias.

During Horowitz`s congressional testimony, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal asked him, ""Is there any evidence that you found that the FBI tried to overthrow the president?"" Horowitz responded, ""No, we found the issues we identified here. That`s what we found."" When Blumenthal said, ""I didn`t find any conclusion that the FBI meddled or interfered in the election to affect the outcome,"" Horowitz replied, ""We did not reach that conclusion.""

Peter Strzok and Lisa Page

Mocking former FBI lawyer Lisa Page and former FBI senior counterintelligence official Peter Strzok, who had an affair while working together, Trump said, ""This poor guy -- did I hear he needed a restraining order after this whole thing, to keep him away from Lisa? That`s what I heard. I don`t know if it`s true. The fake news will never report it. But it could be true. No, that`s what I heard, I don`t know."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: There is no evidence that either Strzok or Page ever obtained or sought a restraining order against the other. Page : There is no evidence that either Strzok or Page ever obtained or sought a restraining order against the other. Page said on Twitter: ""This is a lie. Nothing like this ever happened.""

Immigration

Deportations to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador

""And Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador -- we signed a very important agreement with each. When their people come into our country, they weren`t taking them back. Now they take them back and they say, thank you very much. They weren`t taking them back. If we had a murderer from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, we want to bring them back -- under past administrations, they bring them, they said, `We don`t want them. Don`t land your plane with us.` They say, `Thank you very much. We will take them back.` Because we`ve let them know the price is very bad if they don`t do that."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

Facts First: Trump was mixing up two separate issues. While the Trump administration does have : Trump was mixing up two separate issues. While the Trump administration does have new agreements with all three countries, those agreements are related to the handling of people who come to the US seeking asylum, not criminals the US is seeking to deport. In 2016, just prior to Trump`s presidency, none of the three countries was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered ""recalcitrant"" (uncooperative) in accepting the return of their citizens from the US.

Randy Capps, director of research for US programs at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington think tank, confirmed that Trump was ""confusing"" different things. Capps said Trump was ""way off base"" on this claim.

Capps noted that in the 2016 fiscal year, the last full year before Trump took office, ICE reported that Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador ranked second, third and fourth for the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. The same was true in the 2017 fiscal year , which encompassed the end of Barack Obama`s presidency and the beginning of Trump`s. ICE did not identify any widespread problems with deportations to these countries.

In July 2016, ICE deputy director Daniel Ragsdale testified to Congress that there were some exceptions to the rule: ""It is important to note that while countries may generally be cooperative, sometimes they may delay or refuse the repatriation of certain individuals. For example, El Salvador, a country that is generally cooperative, has recently delayed the issuance of a number of travel documents where there is no legal impediment to removal.""

So Trump could have accurately made a less sweeping claim. But he was exaggerating when he declared that the three countries simply ""weren`t taking them back.""

An arrest in Maryland

""Since Montgomery County, Maryland declared itself a sanctuary jurisdiction in July, we have already identified nine illegal aliens who have been arrested for rape, sexual assault, including a 26-year-old man charged with raping and viciously strangling a young, wonderful woman, who was entering her apartment, innocently entering her apartment. She was raped and killed, strangled to death."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: The victim in this August case was not killed. The Washington Post : The victim in this August case was not killed. The Washington Post reported that the victim ""was taken to a hospital for her injuries. Police said in a statement that `doctors advised detectives that the severity of the strangulation the victim suffered could have resulted in her death.`""

Trump was correct that nine undocumented immigrants have been charged with rape or sexual assault in this Maryland county since July, according to local media reports and a September tweet from Ken Cuccinelli, acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

Democrats

Beto O`Rourke and religion

""We had one candidate who turned out not to be too good a candidate, right? Beto. Beto. Remember? So he wanted to get rid of religion -- the Bible."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Unsuccessful Democratic presidential candidate Beto O`Rourke, the former Texas congressman, never proposed to ""get rid of religion"" or the Bible.

O`Rourke sparked controversy by proposing to strip tax-exempt status from religious institutions, including churches, that oppose same-sex marriage. O`Rourke said ""there can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break"" for any entity ""that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us.""

Trump is free to criticize O`Rourke`s proposal as a violation of the First Amendment, but it`s a major exaggeration to claim that proposing to strip certain churches` tax exemptions is the same as proposing to eradicate religion or the Bible.

Elizabeth Warren`s wealth tax

""You`re not going to vote for Pocahontas, I can tell you that. You`re not going to vote for the wealth tax. `Yeah, let`s take 100% of your wealth away.`"" -- December 7 speech to the Israeli American Council National Summit

Facts First: Warren is not proposing to take away 100% of anyone`s wealth. Her wealth tax : Warren is not proposing to take away 100% of anyone`s wealth. Her wealth tax proposal is for ""an annual 2% tax on every dollar of net worth above $50 million and a 6% tax on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion.""

Elizabeth Warren`s health care plan

""Her ridiculous plan would cost $52 trillion. That`s more money than we take in in one year, two years, three years, four years, five years, six years -- about seven years. That`s for one year, $52 trillion."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Warren`s campaign says her Medicare-for-All proposal would require a total of $52 trillion in health care spending : Warren`s campaign says her Medicare-for-All proposal would require a total of $52 trillion in health care spending over 10 years , not one year. (The Urban Institute think tank estimates that $52 trillion is also the amount that would be spent on health care under current law.) Trump is free to question the Warren campaign`s financial assumptions, but $52 trillion for one year is inaccurate.

Trump was also inaccurate when he suggested that $52 trillion is ""about seven years"" worth of federal revenue. The federal government took in $3.3 trillion in 2018; at that level, $52 trillion would actually represent about 16 years` worth of federal receipts. Trump might have been attempting to refer to how Warren`s proposal would require $20.5 trillion in new spending by the federal government over the next decade; that is roughly six years of federal revenues at the present level, so Trump would be much closer to correct.

Warren has proposed a variety of ways to generate the $20.5 trillion, including higher taxes on wealthy people, increased corporate taxes, improved tax enforcement, new employer fees, and new payments from state and local governments.

Economy

The stock market

Trump was asked about the Dow falling 400 points early that day, December 3, in apparent response to comments he made earlier in the day about the state of trade talks with China. He responded, ""Well it`s up -- let me tell you. We took it up -- it was about at 16,000 or 15,000. And now it`s almost at 30,000. It`s gonna be at 30,000."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

Facts First: The Dow has increased by more than a third during Trump`s presidency, but he was exaggerating where it started. The Dow opened (and closed) just under 20,000 points on the day of his inauguration, not at 15,000 or 16,000. If you go back to the day of his election, as Trump prefers to do, the Dow was over 18,000 points.

The Dow closed over 27,000 on December 3.

November jobs expectations

""The numbers came out, as you saw on Friday, with a number of jobs that nobody believed possible: 200 -- well over 200,000. They were thinking about 50. Some people thought it would be 50,000, 60,000."" -- December 9 remarks at roundtable on school choice

""It was announced that 266,000 jobs were added in November. And that shattered all expectations. They were thinking about 70,000. They were thinking about 90,000 -- which isn`t so bad. Two hundred and sixty-six thousand."" -- December 7 speech to the Israeli American Council National Summit/

""Just last week, we announced that we smashed expectations and created 266,000 jobs in November -- a number that was unthinkable a day before. A day before, they were guessing, `Would it be 80? Would it be 90? Would it be 160?` Somebody said -- an optimist. And this was 266,000..."" -- December 12 speech at White House Summit on Child Care and Paid Leave

Facts First: While the number of jobs added by the US economy in November, 266,000, did exceed analysts` expectations, those expectations were much higher than Trump claimed. The : While the number of jobs added by the US economy in November, 266,000, did exceed analysts` expectations, those expectations were much higher than Trump claimed. The median estimate from economists surveyed by Reuters was 180,000 jobs added -- and the lowest of the economists` estimates was 120,000 jobs added. (So one of Trump`s many figures, the ""160,000,"" does fall within the range of estimates.)

Trump did not specify who he was talking about when he repeatedly referred to an unnamed ""they""; it is certainly plausible that somebody somewhere thought that a mere 50,000, 60,000, 70,000, 80,000 or 90,000 jobs would be added. But Trump created the impression that he was talking about the expectations of economic experts.

The currencies of Brazil and Argentina

""Brazil and Argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies. which is not good for our farmers. Therefore, effective immediately, I will restore the Tariffs on all Steel & Aluminum that is shipped into the U.S. from those countries. The Federal Reserve should likewise act so that countries, of which there are many, no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies."" -- December 2 tweet

Facts First: While the Brazilian real and the Argentinian peso had : While the Brazilian real and the Argentinian peso had declined against the US dollar in the weeks prior to Trump`s announcement, and for the year, experts say there was no evidence either country had been intentionally devaluing either currency. To the contrary, ""the evidence shows that Argentina and Brazil have been trying to do the opposite of what President Trump accuses,"" said Paul Angelo, fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""In fact, this year alone the Brazilian government has repeatedly intervened to slow devaluation of the real and Argentina has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in August trying to shield the peso following a political shock .""

The Wall Street Journal reported after Trump`s announcement: ""...few economists and analysts agreed with Mr. Trump`s claim that the two countries have been manipulating their currencies...Neither Brazil nor Argentina has been featured in the U.S. Treasury Department`s currency report, the official vehicle for designating nations as manipulators."" Bloomberg reported : ""While it`s true the Brazilian real and Argentine peso have weakened against the greenback this year, policy makers in Brasilia and Buenos Aires appear worried rather than happy about this. `Trump should be thanking Brazil and Argentina,` said Andre Perfeito, chief economist at Necton, a Sao Paulo-based brokerage. `Their governments have adopted measures that seek to rein in the depreciation of their currencies.`""

Russian energy production

Claiming that Russia wishes he had lost the election, Trump said, ""We are now number one in the world in energy; Russia`s number three. We`re beating out Russia and Saudi Arabia."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Russia was second in the world in petroleum and natural gas production every year from 2014 through 2018, far exceeding the production of third-place Saudi Arabia in each of those years, according to an August : Russia was second in the world in petroleum and natural gas production every year from 2014 through 2018, far exceeding the production of third-place Saudi Arabia in each of those years, according to an August report from the US government`s Energy Information Administration. (Russia was in first place from 2008 through 2013.)

If you include ""biofuels, and refinery processing gain, among other liquid fuels"" in the count, as the Energy Information Administration did in a 2017 analysis , the US became number one in the world in 2012, not 2014. Regardless, Russia has consistently been in second place by this broader measure as well since the US became number .

No matter which measure you use, Trump`s use of the word ""now"" is arguably misleading. The US has been number one since the presidency of Barack Obama, whom Trump has repeatedly accused of perpetrating a ""war on American energy.""

The American and Chinese economies

""We`re much larger than China now, because we`ve gone up and they`ve gone down."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

Facts First: The US has not just ""now"" become a larger economy than China; that was also the case before Trump took office. And China continues to close the gap: while China`s economy is growing at its : The US has not just ""now"" become a larger economy than China; that was also the case before Trump took office. And China continues to close the gap: while China`s economy is growing at its slowest rate since 1992 , It is still reporting growth greater than that of the US.

China reported 6% economic growth in the third quarter of 2019; the US reported 2.1% third-quarter growth. China`s official figures are not always reliable, but there is no doubt that growth is occurring. In October, the International Monetary Fund predicted 6.1% growth from China in 2019 and 5.8% growth in 2020.

Global warming and the oceans

Mocking fears about global warming, Trump said, ""The ocean`s going to rise. One eighth of an inch within the next 250 years. We`re going to be wiped out!"" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Trump was greatly understating scientists` estimates of rising sea levels. Even in 80 years, the United Nations` Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change expects sea levels to rise by a foot or more.

As FactCheck.org noted , a September report from the UN panel estimated an increase in the global mean sea level by about 1 feet to 2 feet over 1986-2005 levels by 2100 -- even under a lower-carbon-emissions scenario; the report projected much higher increases in a scenario in which emissions were higher. ""Under a higher emissions scenario, the report said, 2 to 3.5 feet of sea level rise are expected,"" FactCheck.org noted. ""By 2300 -- three decades after the president`s timeframe -- sea level rise is likely to be 2 to 3.5 feet, even under lower emissions, according to the IPCC report. With higher emissions, the likely range is between a whopping 7.5 to 18 feet.""

Here are the claims Trump made over these two weeks that we have previously fact checked in one of these weekly roundups:

Ukraine and impeachment

The timing of Rep. Adam Schiff`s comments

""He made up my statement, because -- see, I did one thing very good. As soon as I heard about this deal, I released my statement immediately. But he had already made horrible statements."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Trump can reasonably criticize Schiff for Schiff`s comments at a House Intelligence Committee hearing in September; as we`ve written before, Schiff`s mix of near-quotes from Trump`s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, his own analysis, and supposed ""parody"" was at the very least confusing. But Schiff spoke the day after Trump released the rough transcript, not before Trump released the transcript.

The accuracy of the whistleblower

""By the way, the whistleblower: the whistleblower defrauded our country, because the whistleblower wrote something that was totally untrue...They wrote something totally different from what I said."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

""The whistleblower wrote a totally false statement. So it`s a fraud."" -- December 13 exchange with reporters at meeting with Paraguayan President Description Mario Abdo Benítez

Facts First: The whistleblower`s account of Trump`s call with Zelensky has largely been proven accurate. In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower`s three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. (You can read a full fact check : The whistleblower`s account of Trump`s call with Zelensky has largely been proven accurate. In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower`s three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. (You can read a full fact check here .)

The rough transcript

""They didn`t even know, probably, that we had it transcribed, professionally transcribed, word-for-word transcribed, so beautiful."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: The document released by the White House explicitly says, on the first page, that it is not an exact transcript of Trump`s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The National Security Council`s top Ukraine expert, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, testified to Congress that he tried to make edits to the document to include two things that were said on the call but not included in the document. Vindman testified that the document was ""substantively correct,"" but he made clear that it was not a verbatim account.

The whistleblower being ""gone""

""Where`s the whistleblower? He`s disappeared, he`s gone...the whistleblower is gone. He flew the coop because he reported incorrectly..."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

""But once I released it, all of a sudden the second whistleblower disappeared. The first whistleblower, who was all set to testify, he -- all of a sudden, he becomes this saint-like figure that they don`t need him anymore. The one that everybody wanted to see, including Schiff, was the whistleblower. Once I released the text of what happened -- the transcript -- that was the end. Everybody disappeared. So now there`s no informer. There`s no second whistleblower. Everybody has gone."" -- December 13 exchange with reporters at meeting with Paraguayan President Description Mario Abdo Benítez

Facts First: There is no evidence that either the first whistleblower (who filed the complaint about Trump`s dealings with Ukraine) or the second whistleblower (whose lawyers said they had firsthand information corroborating claims made by the first whistleblower) are now somehow ""gone,"" let alone that they are ""gone"" because the first whistleblower was shown to be inaccurate.

""The whistleblowers have not vanished,"" Bradley Moss, a colleague of Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the two whistleblowers, said on Twitter in October, when Trump made another version of this claim.

The first whistleblower`s lawyers, Zaid and Andrew Bakaj, wrote in the Washington Post in October: ""Because our client has no additional information about the president`s call, there is no justification for exposing their identity and all the risks that would follow.""

The existence of the second whistleblower -- who never planned to file a separate whistleblower complaint -- was revealed after Trump released the rough transcript of his call with Zelensky, not before.

European assistance to Ukraine

""The other thing nobody remembers and nobody likes to talk about -- and I talk about it all the time -- is why isn`t Germany, why isn`t France, why aren`t other European countries paying? Because we`re paying. The suckers... Why aren`t European countries paying? Why isn`t France paying a lot of money? Why is it always the United States?"" -- December 13 exchange with reporters at meeting with Paraguayan President Description Mario Abdo Benítez

Facts First: European countries, including France and Germany, have provided hundreds of millions of dollars` worth of assistance to Ukraine since Russia`s invasion in 2014.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged European ""help"" during his meeting with Trump at the United Nations in September, though he said the world`s efforts had been inadequate so far: ""And, I`m sorry, but we don`t need help; we need support. Real support. And we thank -- thank everybody, thank all of the European countries; they each help us. But we also want to have more -- more.""

Zelensky`s comments

""Breaking News: The President of Ukraine has just again announced that President Trump has done nothing wrong with respect to Ukraine and our interactions or calls."" -- December 2 tweet

""The Ukrainian president came out and said, very strongly, that `President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong.`"" -- December 2 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure

""I had a very, very good conversation with the head of Ukraine. And, by the way, yesterday, he came out again and reaffirmed again that we had a very, very respectful, good conversation -- that President Trump did nothing wrong."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

Facts First: Trump was : Trump was mischaracterizing Zelensky`s comments in an interview published by Time magazine. Zelensky did not say Trump ""did nothing wrong.""

Asked about ""this issue of the quid pro quo"" with regard to US military aid to Ukraine and the investigations Trump and his allies wanted, Zelensky responded, ""Look, I never talked to the President from the position of a quid pro quo. That`s not my thing."" But Zelensky continued: ""I don`t want us to look like beggars. But you have to understand. We`re at war. If you`re our strategic partner, then you can`t go blocking anything for us. I think that`s just about fairness. It`s not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.""

Trump is entitled to tout Zelensky`s statement about not talking to Trump ""from the position of a quid pro quo,"" but those words aren`t equivalent to Zelensky saying Trump did nothing wrong.

Impeachment hearings

Trump complained about an impeachment hearing that the House Judiciary Committee had scheduled, then said, ""For the hearings, we don`t get a lawyer, we don`t get any witnesses."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

Facts First: Unlike the impeachment inquiry hearings that were held in November by the House Intelligence Committee, Trump was allowed to have his lawyer participate in the House Judiciary Committee proceedings in December. Trump declined the offer to have a lawyer appear at the particular hearing he was complaining about here, during which four constitutional law scholars appeared. Also, a Republican lawyer was permitted to question witnesses at the House Intelligence Committee hearings, though Trump`s own lawyers were not.

White House counsel Pat Cipollone said in a letter to Democratic House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler that ""an invitation to an academic discussion with law professors does not begin to provide the President with any semblance of a fair process.""

Though the Democrats got to control the witness lists, since they hold the House majority, the House Intelligence Committee did hear testimony from three former officials whom Republicans had requested as witnesses: Kurt Volker, the former special representative for Ukraine; Tim Morrison, former National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia; and David Hale, undersecretary of state for political affairs.

Economy

Ivanka Trump and jobs

""Fourteen million people she`s gotten jobs for, where she would go into Walmart, she would go into our great companies and say, `They really want help. They really want you to teach them,` because the government can`t teach like the companies can teach. And companies would take a half a million people, a million people. And her goal when she started it two years ago was 500,000 jobs; she`s done over 14 million."" -- December 12 speech at White House Summit on Child Care and Paid Leave

Facts First: Ivanka Trump has obviously not ""gotten jobs for"" 14 million people. At the time, roughly 7 million jobs had been created during the entire Trump presidency.

Trump was referring to the White House`s Pledge to America`s Workers initiative, in which Ivanka Trump has sought to get companies to commit to providing ""education and training opportunities"" for workers. As of Wednesday, companies had promised to create 14.4 million opportunities -- but many of these opportunities are internal training programs, not new jobs. Also, as CNN has previously reported, many of the companies had already planned these opportunities before Ivanka Trump launched the initiative.

Unemployment

""We have the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers. We have the best numbers we`ve ever had in our country."" -- December 10 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure

Facts First: The unemployment rates for some demographic groups are at their lowest levels ""ever,"" but the overall unemployment rate is not -- though it is indeed impressively low.

The overall rate was 3.5% in November -- the lowest since 1969, with the exception of the 3.5% rate in September, but well above the record 2.5% set in 1953.

Unemployment for women

In two separate instances, Trump said that women`s unemployment is ""at a record number"" and that it is ""the lowest in 71 years.""

Facts First: The unemployment rate for women was not a ""record,"" nor the lowest in ""71 years."" It had been 66 years, not 71 years, since the women`s unemployment rate has been as low as it was in November, : The unemployment rate for women was not a ""record,"" nor the lowest in ""71 years."" It had been 66 years, not 71 years, since the women`s unemployment rate has been as low as it was in November, 3.5% . (That`s if you ignore the 3.4% in September and April.)

The steel industry

""And the steel companies are doing incredibly well. They were finished."" And ""...they were ready to close up -- all of them -- and now they`re doing great."" -- December 9 remarks at roundtable on school choice

""But the steel industry, in particular, was -- we weren`t going to have a steel industry...Everything was closing down."" -- December 6 remarks at roundtable on small business and red tape

Facts First: The US steel industry was not ""finished"" before Trump imposed his tariffs on imported steel, nor was ""everything"" shutting down. While some American steel companies were struggling, not ""all of them"" were anywhere close to closing. In fact, some major companies were thriving.

Bloomberg reported in an October 2018 fact check: ""In fact, U.S. steelmakers Nucor Corp. and Steel Dynamics Inc. were two of the healthiest commodity companies in the world before Trump took office.""

There is no doubt that the steel industry had declined from its heyday: the number of people working in iron and steel mills or in making steel products fell from more than 250,000 in 1990 to under 150,000 by 2016. Still, ""finished"" is an exaggeration. In 2016 , the US produced about as much raw steel as it did at various points in the 1980s.

Steel plants

""And now the steel industry -- if you look at what`s going on, the industry is doing incredibly well. They`re building a lot of extensions. They`re building brand-new plants where they never...they never built a new plant. I mean, they hadn`t built one in years, and now they`re building new plants all over the country."" -- December 6 remarks at roundtable on small business and red tape

Facts First: While some steel plants were closing, being idled or otherwise doing poorly before Trump took office and before Trump imposed his tariffs on steel imports, some other plants were being built or expanding at the time.

A simple Google search brings up numerous 2015 announcements about planned investments in steel plants. For example, Steel Dynamics announced a $100 million expansion at a mill in Mississippi. Commercial Metals announced a $250 million investment to build a micro-mill in Oklahoma. Nucor and a partner announced a $75 million investment in improvements at a mill in Arkansas. Ferrous CAL announced a $53 million investment in a Michigan plant to make steel for automotive companies.

Energy production

""We ended the last administration`s war on American energy. The United States is now -- and I said it, and I`ll say it all night long, number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And there`s nobody even close."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: The US has not just ""now"" become the world`s top energy producer: it took the top spot : The US has not just ""now"" become the world`s top energy producer: it took the top spot in 2012 , according to the US government`s Energy Information Administration -- under the very Obama administration Trump is accusing of perpetrating a ""war"" on the industry.

The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump`s tenure. ""The United States has been the world`s top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world`s top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia`s,"" the Energy Information Administration says

Wage growth

""...more importantly than anything, wages are up for the first time in many, many years, decades, decades."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Wages have been rising since 2014, using one common measure.

There are various ways to measure wage growth. Median usual weekly earnings, one way that is frequently cited , began increasing in mid-2014 -- though slowly -- after a decline that began in the recession year of 2009. Median usual weekly warnings went from $330 per week in the second quarter of 2014 to $349 per week in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Trump can accurately boast that wage growth during his presidency has been faster than under Obama, but he is wrong to suggest it was declining before he took office.

Obama and manufacturing jobs

""And the previous administration said -- manufacturing -- `you`d need the magic wand.` You know, we`ve all heard the statement. But they basically said it was a dead business, when in fact it`s one of the most important sets of jobs I think you can have anywhere."" -- December 6 remarks at roundtable on small business and red tape

Facts First: Trump`s ""magic wand"" comment was a reference to a remark President Barack Obama made at a PBS : Trump`s ""magic wand"" comment was a reference to a remark President Barack Obama made at a PBS town hall in 2016. Obama scoffed at Trump`s promises to bring back what Obama called ""jobs of the past"" without providing specifics on how he would do so. Contrary to Trump`s claims, though, Obama didn`t say manufacturing was dead or that new manufacturing jobs could not be created; Obama boasted of how many manufacturing jobs were being created during his presidency, saying, ""We actually make more stuff, have a bigger manufacturing base today than we`ve had in most of our history.""

Median household income and energy

""With President Trump, it (median household income) went up $5,000, but whoa, whoa, whoa, in less than three years. That`s a big thing. Wait. And then when you add energy savings and you add tax savings, you have almost a $10,000 gain in three years."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: There is no basis for Trump adding an additional $5,000 to the initial $5,000 in household income growth he is asserting. (That initial $5,000 figure is based on the findings of a firm called Sentier Research). It is entirely unclear what Trump is referring to when he talks about ""energy savings""; household energy costs have increased since Trump took office, as have gasoline costs. (Gasoline costs are lower than they were for most of Obama`s presidency, but higher than they were in 2016.)

China and trade

China`s economic performance

In three separate instances, Trump said that China is having its worst economic year ""in 57 years,"" ""in 56 or 57 years now,"" and ""in at least 57"" years, ""much more than that.""

Facts First: China`s second-quarter GDP growth of 6.2% and third-quarter GDP growth of 6% were its : China`s second-quarter GDP growth of 6.2% and third-quarter GDP growth of 6% were its worst since 1992 , 27 years ago. Trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that 27 years is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason.

Who is paying for Trump`s tariffs on China

""And now we`re taking in billions of dollars in tariffs. And, by the way, they`re eating it. You know, remember, you used to tell me how it will cost us -- they`re eating that money because they don`t want to lose their supply chains."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

Facts First: Study after study , including a report in late November from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has shown that Americans are bearing the vast majority of the cost of the tariffs. And it is Americans who make the actual tariff payments.

The history of tariffs on China

""We`re taking in a lot of money. We haven`t taken any money from China ever, and it`s coming in now by the billions."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Again, Americans are paying for these tariffs. Regardless, it`s not true that the US Treasury has never received any money from tariffs on Chinese products. The US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries; FactCheck.org : Again, Americans are paying for these tariffs. Regardless, it`s not true that the US Treasury has never received any money from tariffs on Chinese products. The US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries; FactCheck.org reported that the US generated an ""average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the US International Trade Commission DataWeb.""

The US also ""takes"" in money from Chinese purchases of US products -- more than $300 billion during Trump`s presidency alone.

China`s wealth

Trump said China is ""down about $32 trillion"" over the last three years. -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

Facts First: Trump was vague about what he meant, but there is no apparent basis for this figure. (In late November, Trump used different figures: ""$24 trillion,"" ""probably $25 trillion,"" and ""probably ... $30 or $35 trillion."") Experts on the Chinese economy rejected previous Trump claims of a $10 trillion drop in Chinese wealth.

George Magnus, a research associate at Oxford University`s China Centre, said, ""I`m afraid I have no idea to what the President is referring and I dare say neither does he.""

The US record at the World Trade Organization

""We never used to win before me, because, before me, the United States was a sucker for all of these different organizations. And now they realize -- the World Trade Organization realizes that my attitude on them: If they don`t treat us fairly, well, I`ll tell you someday what will happen. And we`ve been winning a lot of cases at the World Trade Organization. We virtually -- very rarely did we ever win a case. They took advantage of the United States."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

Facts First: The US has long won cases at the World Trade Organization, and there is no evidence that WTO adjudicators have suddenly changed their behavior. Trump`s own Council of Economic Advisers : The US has long won cases at the World Trade Organization, and there is no evidence that WTO adjudicators have suddenly changed their behavior. Trump`s own Council of Economic Advisers said in a report in February 2018 that the US had won 86% of the cases it has brought since 1995. The global average was 84%.

A Bloomberg Law review in March found that the US success rate in cases it brings to the WTO had increased very slightly since Trump took office, from 84.8% in 2016 to 85.4%.

The trade deficit with the European Union

""But we have a very unfair trade situation, where the US loses a lot of money for many, many years with the European Union -- billions and billions of dollars. I mean, to be specific, over $150 billion a year."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron

Facts First: The trade deficit with the European Union was $114.6 billion in 2018, $101.2 billion in 2017, $92.5 billion in 2016. The deficit was $169.6 billion in 2018 if you only count trade in goods and ignore trade in services. But Trump, as usual, failed to specify that he was using this more limited measure.

We`ll ignore Trump`s characterization of trade deficits as losses, which is sharply disputed by many economists.

Immigration

Democrats and borders

Trump said three times that Democrats support ""open borders.""

Facts First: Even 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.

Mexican soldiers and the border

""...and Mexico is now giving us 27,000 soldiers at our border..."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

""Right now, we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our southern border telling people, `You can`t come in.`"" -- December 7 speech to the Israeli American Council National Summit

Facts First: Mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular.

CNN reported on November 2: ""Nearly 15,000 troops are deployed to Mexico`s northern border, where they`ve set up 20 checkpoints, Mexican Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval said last week at a press briefing on the country`s security strategy. At the southern border, 12,000 troops are deployed and have set up 21 checkpoints.""

Acting US Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan has offered similar numbers, telling reporters in September that 10,000 of approximately 25,000 troops were on Mexico`s southern border.

Foreign and military affairs

Obama and the ISIS caliphate

""We`ve defeated the ISIS caliphate. Nobody thought we could do that so quickly. I did it very quickly. When I came in, it was virtually 100%. And I knocked it down to 0. I knocked it down to 0."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

""Al-Baghdadi created a caliphate bigger than the state of Ohio, think of that, that`s a big caliphate. And we now have taken 100% of the caliphate...and with Obama you did nothing, you did nothing, but get your ass kicked."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Trump is free to criticize Obama`s conduct of the war against ISIS, but it`s not true that ""nothing"" was accomplished under Obama in the fight to eradicate the terror group`s self-proclaimed ""caliphate,"" nor that ISIS possessed ""virtually 100%"" of this territory when Trump took office.

Nicholas Heras, Middle East Security Fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said that ""at the time of his inauguration in January 2017, the Obama administration had regained close to 50% of ISIS`s would-be Caliphate.""

Estimates of pre-Trump progress against ISIS vary -- some put the Obama-era progress closer to a third of former ISIS territory -- but Heras` estimate roughly squares with news reports from the end of the Obama era. Regardless of the precise figure, there is no doubt that ISIS had lost a substantial portion of its land holdings under Obama.

The cost of moving the embassy to Jerusalem

""So, two years ago, I recognized the true capital of Israel, and we opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And we got it built. They were thinking anywhere, for one billion to two billion dollars. I did it for $350,000."" -- December 11 speech at Hanukkah reception and signing of executive order against anti-Semitism

Four days pror, Trump told a lengthy version of this story, saying he was initially told the Jerusalem embassy project would cost ""$2 billion"" or ""up to $2 billion"" but managed to get it built for ""less than 500,000 bucks."" -- December 7 speech to the Israeli American Council National Summit

Facts First: The State Department : The State Department awarded a $21.2 million contract in 2018 for a company to design and build ""compound security upgrades"" related to Trump`s decision to turn the existing facility into an embassy. While the initial modification that allowed the building to open as an embassy cost just under $400,000, that was not the final total.

The size of the Iran deal

In three separate claims, Trump said President Barack Obama ""gave $150 billion"" to Iran, ""paid $150 billion"" to Iran, and gave Iran a ""$150 Billion gift.""

Facts First: Trump was wrong about the ""$150 billion"": the sum in question was Iranian money frozen in foreign financial institutions because of sanctions, not US government money -- and experts say the total was significantly lower than $150 billion. You can read a fuller fact check : Trump was wrong about the ""$150 billion"": the sum in question was Iranian money frozen in foreign financial institutions because of sanctions, not US government money -- and experts say the total was significantly lower than $150 billion. You can read a fuller fact check here

The Obama administration did send Iran $1.7 billion to settle a decades-old dispute over a purchase of US military goods Iran made before its government was overthrown in the Islamic Revolution of 1979.

Military spending by NATO members

""It was going down for close to 20 years. If you look at a chart, it was like a rollercoaster down, nothing up. And that was going on for a long time. You wouldn`t have had a NATO if you kept going that way."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

""So NATO, which was really heading in the wrong direction three years ago — it was heading down. If you look at a graph, it was to a point where I don`t think they could have gone on much longer."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron

Facts First: Military spending by NATO members had increased for two years prior to Trump`s presidency. According to the latest NATO : Military spending by NATO members had increased for two years prior to Trump`s presidency. According to the latest NATO figures released in November, spending increased by 1.7% in 2015 and 3.0% in 2016.

US military spending, part 1

""Now we have spent two and a half trillion dollars on rebuilding our military. And we have a military that`s the most advanced, the most powerful, by far, of any in the world. Two and a half trillion dollars. We rebuilt our military."" -- December 7 speech to the Israeli American Council National Summit

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. Defense spending for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was $2.05 trillion, and that includes more than three-and-a-half months of Obama`s tenure, since the 2017 fiscal year began in October 2016.

Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he thinks Trump must have been including military funding for the 2020 fiscal year to get to the ""$2.5 trillion"" figure -- but the 2020 fiscal year just started on October 1, and Harrison noted that the defense appropriation has not yet been approved by Congress.

US military spending, part 2

Trump said on two occasions that the US is spending ""4 to 4.3%"" of Gross Domestic Product on defense.

Facts First: The US is expected to spend 3.42% of GDP on defense in 2019, according to NATO estimates issued in November -- similar to its 2018 spending level.

Ammunition

Trump said that when he took office, the US military ""was in trouble."" He added, ""We didn`t have ammunition."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

Facts First: According to military leaders, there was a shortfall in certain kinds of munitions, particularly precision-guided bombs, late in the Obama presidency and early in the Trump presidency. But the claim that ""we didn`t have ammunition"" is a significant exaggeration. Military leaders did not say that they had completely run out of any kind of bomb, let alone ammunition in general.

You can read a full fact check of Trump`s claims about munitions levels here

ISIS prisoners

""But many are from France, many are from Germany, many are from UK. They`re mostly from Europe."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron

Facts First: French President Emmanuel Macron correctly told Trump that it is not true that ""most"" ISIS prisoners in Syria are from Europe.

James Jeffrey, Trump`s special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, said on August 1 that roughly 8,000 of about 10,000 terrorist fighters being held in northeastern Syria are Iraqi or Syrian nationals; there were ""about 2,000 ISIS foreign fighters"" from all other countries. Trump himself tweeted in February to ask that European countries take back ""over 800"" ISIS fighters captured in Syria.

Macron fact-checked Trump to his face, saying: ""The very large number of fighters you have on the ground are ISIS fighters coming from Syria, from Iraq, and the region. It is true that you have foreign fighters coming from Europe, but this is a tiny minority of the overall problem we have in the region.""

An agreement with South Korea

Trump claimed that South Korea had agreed to an increase of ""almost $500 million"" in its payments to the US for the cost of having US troops based in the country. He said that this increase brought the South Korean payment ""close to"" $1 billion from a previous $500 million. -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

Facts First: Trump was correct about the new total but exaggerated the size of the increase, as he has repeatedly on this subject in the past. As the New York Times : Trump was correct about the new total but exaggerated the size of the increase, as he has repeatedly on this subject in the past. As the New York Times reported in February when debunking an earlier version of Trump`s ""$500 million"" claim: ""Under the one-year deal, this year South Korea will pay 1.04 trillion won, or $925 million, an increase of $70 million from last year`s $855 million.""

Trump is now trying to get South Korea to agree to a much larger increase for 2020. American and South Korean officials said this week that they have so far failed to reach an agreement and that the next round of talks is scheduled for January.

Trump and Brexit

""You know that I was a fan of Brexit. I called it the day before. I was opening up Turnberry the day before Brexit...And they asked me whether or not Brexit would happen. I said `yes,` and everybody smiled and they laughed. And I said, `Yes, it`s going to happen, in my opinion.` It was just my opinion. The next day, they had the election, and I was right."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

Facts First: Trump was not even at Turnberry the day before the vote; he visited the club and spoke to the press : Trump was not even at Turnberry the day before the vote; he visited the club and spoke to the press the day after the vote. Trump did predict Brexit in March 2016; the day before the vote three months later, however, he made no prediction. He said in an interview that day with Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business, ""I don`t think anybody should listen to me,"" because ""I haven`t really focused on it very much,"" but that his ""inclination"" would be that Britain should vote to leave the European Union.

Iran`s economy

""Their GDP went down 25% this year. Twenty-five. Nobody has ever even heard of that."" -- December 7 speech to the Israeli American Council National Summit

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. While Iran`s economy is shrinking, the Statistical Center of Iran : Trump was exaggerating. While Iran`s economy is shrinking, the Statistical Center of Iran reported that the country`s GDP fell by 4.9% in the year 2018-2019.

Experts say there is no apparent basis for Trump`s ""25%"" figure even though Iran`s official economic data is less reliable than official data in the US.

""It`s still not iron-clad stuff, but if the situation was anywhere near 25% decline then the official stats would at least be in the teens. This is also why folks cross-check these numbers with independent and global institutional data (such as IMF`s). My suspicion is that it`s closer to 13-15% decrease, which still puts it a good 10% points below Trump`s claim,"" Hussein Banai, an assistant professor who studies Iran at Indiana University`s School of International Studies, said in an email in October, when Trump made another version of this claim.

The International Monetary Fund has forecast a 9.5% contraction in Iran`s economy this year -- down from an earlier estimate of a 6% contraction, but still not 20% or 25%. The World Bank has forecast an 8.7% contraction in the 2019-2020 period.

Environment

Wind power

""Those windmills, wah wah wah [windmill sound]. `Darling, I want to watch television tonight and there`s no damn wind. What do I do? I want to watch the election results, darling, there`s no wind, the damn wind just isn`t blowing like it used to because of global warming, I think. I think it`s global warming.`"" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Using wind power as part of a mix of power sources does not cause power outages even when the wind isn`t blowing, as the federal Department of Energy : Using wind power as part of a mix of power sources does not cause power outages even when the wind isn`t blowing, as the federal Department of Energy explains on its website. ""Studies have shown that the grid can accommodate large penetrations of variable renewable power without sacrificing reliability, and without the need for `backup` generation,"" the Department of Energy says.

Air quality

""Look, I want clean air. I want clean water, crystal clean. I want -- and that`s what we have at a record level. Our air and our water are cleaner now than it`s ever been, OK, with all that we`re doing."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: By several measures, US air was : By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it has been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency data.

Additionally, there were more ""unhealthy air days"" for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016 -- 799 days across the 35 American cities surveyed by the EPA, up from 702. Though there were significantly more ""unhealthy air days"" in Obama`s first term than there have been in Trump`s, the lowest amount of unhealthy air days -- 598 -- occurred in 2014 under Obama.

Judicial vacancies

""We will soon have 182 federal judges, including court of appeals, nobody can believe it. All because Barack Obama gave us 142 empty seats."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Trump exaggerated. According to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments, there were 103 vacancies on district and appeals courts on Jan. 1, 2017, just before Trump took office, plus a vacancy on the Supreme Court.

Pre-existing conditions

""We will strongly protect patients with pre-existing conditions."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: We usually don`t fact check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward : We usually don`t fact check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare`s protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void. He has not issued a plan to reinstate the law`s protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds.

The government`s land holdings

""Secretary Dave Bernhardt. Where is David? David is the largest landlord in the country by a factor of about 50. By a -- when we think we big landlords, he controls half of the United States, actually. Secretary of the Interior."" -- December 11 speech at Hanukkah reception

Facts First: We know Trump was speaking informally here, but ""half of the United States"" is a significant exaggeration. The Congressional Research Service : We know Trump was speaking informally here, but ""half of the United States"" is a significant exaggeration. The Congressional Research Service reported in 2017 : ""The federal government owns roughly 640 million acres, about 28% of the 2.27 billion acres of land in the United States."" The land is managed by the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture.

Road approval times

""...to build a road can take 22 years to get approvals...And we`ve got that process down to four and a half years. It`s going to be -- I think it`s going to be two years. We`re going to try and get it down to almost one year."" -- December 6 remarks at roundtable on small business and red tape

Facts First: There is no evidence Trump has reduced the approval time for federal road approvals.

This version of Trump`s claim was more accurate than his usual one. Though he has repeatedly claimed, inaccurately, that he has gotten the approval time down to two years or less, he acknowledged here that the approval time is significantly longer than that.

Nonetheless, he was wrong when he claimed that the current approval time represents a Trump-era improvement. According to the Federal Highway Administration`s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) page , the department`s median environmental impact statement completion time was 47 months in 2018, up from 46 months in 2017 and 44 months in 2016. (There is no apparent basis for Trump`s ""22 years"" claim; he might be referring to some particular exceptional case.)

We asked the Department of Transportation if we are missing something, but we did not receive a response. We will update this item if we receive any new information.

Approval among Republicans

Trump claimed five times to have a ""95%"" approval rating among Republicans. On four of those occasions, he said this was ""a record."" He twice claimed that Ronald Reagan is in second place at ""87.""

Facts First: Trump`s approval rating among Republicans is very high, regularly in the 80s and sometimes creeping into the 90s, but it has not been 95% in any recent major poll we could find.

Trump was at 81% approval with Republicans in an Ipsos/Reuters poll conducted December 9-10, 85% in a Fox News poll conducted December 8-11, 91% in a NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll conducted December 9-11, 92% in a Quinnipiac University poll conducted December 4-9.", From an imaginary restraining order to a phantom drop in NATO spending: Trump makes 99 false claims in two weeks ,12-2019
"But so far, the report has remained out of their reach.

The Washington Post obtained a copy of the document in June and has drawn on it and other records for a series of stories about the role of cash gifts among senior clerics in the church’s ongoing sex abuse crisis.

AD

The 60-page report is brimming with investigative findings about how Bransfield allegedly groomed and inappropriately touched young men and spent millions of dollars in church money on himself and on fellow clerics.

AD

After church officials repeatedly declined to say whether they were going to release the report, The Post has decided to publish it on its website for the first time with some details redacted to protect the identities of alleged victims of sexual improprieties. The Post is doing so in response to significant interest from the public.

“The people of West Virginia cannot trust that an adequate investigation has been done, or that ‘amends’ have really been made if we do not know the full picture of the behavior of Bransfield and of diocesan personnel,” Michael Iafrate, a co-coordinator for the lay organization Catholic Committee of Appalachia, said last month.

AD

Church officials in West Virginia have said they don’t have a copy of the report, even though two people with knowledge of the matter say the diocese paid more than $500,000 for the investigation. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the investigation.

AD

“The Holy See commissioned the preliminary investigation, thus the report belongs to the Holy See,” Tim Bishop, a spokesman for the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston, said in a statement. “The Diocese paid the costs associated with the investigation because it was warranted by the conduct of its former bishop.”

The spokesman did not respond to a question about the $500,000 claim.

AD

Bransfield retired in September 2018, as church officials announced Baltimore Archbishop William E. Lori would oversee an investigation into unspecified allegations of financial and sexual misconduct.

Lori hired the law firm Zuckerman Spaeder to lead a five-person investigative team that included two lawyers from the firm, the chancellor of the Baltimore diocese, a financial consultant and a retired human resources official from the West Virginia diocese.

AD

Since February, when the confidential investigative report was completed, West Virginia’s attorney general and police in Washington, D.C., have issued subpoenas to church officials in Wheeling and Baltimore, seeking the report and other records about Bransfield that they believe could help investigations into sex abuse claims.

AD

In public statements, church officials repeatedly pledged to cooperate.

“The Diocese stands ready to cooperate fully with any civil investigation and law enforcement request,” Bishop told The Post in October.

West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said the church is not fulfilling its promise.

“The Diocese has denied our request for the Bransfield report, saying the report is with the Pope and out of its hands,” said Morrisey, who asked for the confidential report as part of a lawsuit against the diocese alleging that it knowingly hired sexual predators. “How is that cooperating?”

AD

Sean Caine, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of Baltimore, also said that the report was the property of the Vatican. Caine did not respond to a question about whether the archdiocese has a copy.

AD

“The report on the preliminary investigation was sent to Rome,” Caine said in a statement.

A Vatican spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.

Bransfield has denied wrongdoing.

In recent months, FBI agents have interviewed multiple church officials in West Virginia about Bransfield. It is not clear if they have asked for the report. An FBI spokesman declined to comment.

D.C. police are probing an allegation that Bransfield inappropriately touched a 9-year-old girl on a church trip to the nation’s capital. They have sent subpoenas for a broad array of Bransfield-related documents to church leaders in West Virginia and the archdioceses of Baltimore and Philadelphia, where Bransfield started his career.

AD

AD

The subpoenas, signed by a D.C. Superior Court judge on Sept. 20, demand “all records that in any way relate to any allegations of sexual or physical abuse” involving Bransfield, “regardless of whether the allegations were ultimately deemed credible,” according to a copy obtained by The Post.

West Virginia and Philadelphia have provided some records, according to a person familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it. Baltimore officials are considering the matter, the person said.

“The Archdiocese is reviewing the document to understand what is requested,” Caine said on Thursday. “We will be fully cooperative in our response, as is our long-standing practice.”

"War broke out between President Donald Trump and his former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, after Bannon was quoted in excerpts of an upcoming book as making disparaging comments about his former boss.

Trump`s allies are abandoning Bannon en masse.

It could affect some 2018 primaries.



Wednesday was just the third day of 2018. But three days were all that was needed for the first major US political war of the new year to break out.

On one side is the former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who was quoted in excerpts of Michael Wolff`s book ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,"" set to be released Tuesday, as eviscerating President Donald Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr., his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his daughter Ivanka Trump.

On the other side are Trump and his allies. Trump lambasted Bannon in one of his most scathing statements as president, suggesting Bannon had ""lost his mind"" and was ""only in it for himself.""

""Steve pretends to be at war with the media, which he calls the opposition party, yet he spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was,"" Trump said. ""It is the only thing he does well. Steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phony books.""

It became clear very quickly in the hours after Trump`s scorched-earth statement who would come out on top: the president.

Almost immediately, Republican Senate candidates whom Bannon has endorsed in their primary races to unseat establishment hopefuls backed away from the mercurial media executive turned political strategist.

A representative for one of those candidates, Kelli Ward of Arizona, said that Bannon`s was just ""one of many high-profile endorsements"" Ward had received and that she was focusing on ""helping President Trump advance an America First agenda.""

Meanwhile, in West Virginia, Rep. Evan Jenkins, who`s running for a US Senate seat, called on his GOP primary opponent, Patrick Morrisey, to disavow Bannon`s endorsement.

For the most part, Morrisey obliged.

""Attorney General Morrisey does not support these attacks on President Trump and his family, and was proud to stand with President Trump in 2016 when they were both overwhelmingly elected in West Virginia and when he cast his vote for Trump in the Electoral College,"" a representative for his campaign said.

`Bannon has no contingent`

Meanwhile, Bannon`s more-establishment nemeses were thrilled with Trump`s scorching condemnation.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — who in September went toe to toe with Bannon in the Alabama Republican Senate primary that ended with the candidate Bannon backed, Roy Moore, winning the nomination — told Trump his statement was ""perfect"" and that he ""wouldn`t change a word,"" The Washington Post reported.

Trump`s allies were even more forceful in their condemnation of a man who was once the CEO of his presidential campaign and held one of the most prominent positions in the White House. Bannon left the White House in August and resumed his role as the executive chairman of Breitbart News.

""Bannon has no contingent,"" the former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told April Ryan, a White House correspondent. ""There`s a Trump wing of the Republican Party. There`s not a Bannon wing.""

Anthony Scaramucci, the White House communications director who was fired over the summer after blasting Bannon in a conversation with a New Yorker reporter, took what amounted to a daylong victory lap. He made multiple TV appearances and fired off several tweets to proclaim that he was right.

""I said what I said in the Summer take out the expletives and pay closer attention,"" Scaramucci tweeted, adding that Trump was ""doing a great job.""

Trump Jr., who was at the center of Bannon`s most forceful criticism in the book`s excerpts, unloaded on him as well.

He said Bannon had ""no ideology"" other ""than what`s good for Steve"" and mocked him for backing Moore, who was defeated last month in the special election by the Democrat Doug Jones.

Trump, however, had also enthusiastically supported Moore, whom several women have accused of sexual misconduct, in the campaign`s final days.

""It would be amazing if there would have been a nice simple path to keeping this seat with a nice 30 point margin... #thankssteve,"" Trump Jr. tweeted.

The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Trump and Bannon had become ""increasingly estranged"" in the weeks after what was an embarrassing loss for the Republican Party in the Alabama race.

Trump was enraged by Bannon`s interview with Vanity Fair in which he blasted Kushner, the Times report says, and it appears as if the release of excerpts from Wolff`s book this week was the final straw.

Trump`s lawyers have sent cease-and-desist letters to Bannon, Wolff, and his publisher. Some parts of the book have already been challenged, though Wolff says he has hours of tapes from his time in the White House — which, The Times reported, was frequently spent in Bannon`s office.

`Clearly, the pathway is even more complicated after today`

The disintegration of Trump`s relationship with Bannon could lead to further changes in the political and policy landscape — particularly as the 2018 primaries near.

Bannon`s seeking to barnstorm the country campaigning for hard-right challengers this year could hit a snag in light of the recent feud that has caused some of his preferred candidates to distance themselves from him.

And the White House on Wednesday night moved to disband its controversial voter-fraud commission, laying blame on the former chief strategist and calling it a ""blundered Bannon rollout"" that ""should`ve never been in place.""

Trump`s breaking up with Bannon was ""not too surprising"" to Alex Conant, who was Sen. Marco Rubio`s communications director during his 2016 presidential campaign.

""Bannon has long overstated his role in Trump`s election,"" Conant told Business Insider. ""Trump`s response will probably give Bannon even more media attention, at least in the short term. At the end of the day, it`s bad for both men.""

Conant added that candidates ""who tied themselves to Bannon were already facing a very different pathway to victory.""

""Clearly, the pathway is even more complicated after today,"" he said.

Rick Tyler, the communications director for Sen. Ted Cruz`s 2016 presidential campaign, told Business Insider that the fallout between Trump and Bannon ""was bound to happen"" because there were ""too many egos for one stage.""

But he was less bullish on the episode`s effect on the coming primaries because, he said, ""neither has shown to be a deciding factor in winning races.""

Bannon, sensing where the winds were blowing, spoke glowingly of Trump on his Breitbart radio program on Wednesday. But it may be too late.

""The president of the United States is a great man,"" he said. ""You know I support him day in and day out, whether going through the country giving the `Trump miracle` speech, or on the show, or on the website. So you don`t have to worry about that.""

Trump took notice. He told members of the press in a White House meeting on Thursday that Bannon ""called me a great man last night.""

"In addition to keeping the government operating through Feb. 8, the bill would extend the popular Children’s Health Insurance Program for another six years.

Senate votes to end shutdown.

The Senate voted 81-18 on Monday to end the three-day-old government shutdown, with Democrats joining Republicans to fund the government through February 8 in exchange for a promise from Republican leaders to address the fate of young, undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers.

“In a few hours, the government will reopen,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. “We have a lot to do.”

The House must still vote on the measure later Monday afternoon or evening, but final passage is a formality. The bill also funds the popular Children’s Health Insurance Program for six years and delays or suspends a handful of tax increases that were to help pay for insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

After a weekend of partisan finger-pointing — in which Democrats branded the shutdown the “Trump Shutdown,” after President Trump, and Republicans branded it the “Schumer shutdown” — Monday’s vote offered Republicans and Democrats a way out of an ugly impasse that threatened to cause political harm to both parties.

Mr. Schumer, speaking on the Senate floor, announced that he and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, had “come to an arrangement” to adopt the three-week spending measure while continuing to negotiate a “global agreement” that would include the fate of the dreamers, undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children.

Monday’s vote came after a frantic weekend of work by a bipartisan group of more than 20 senators, who on Sunday night were discussing a plan in which the government would stay open through early February, coupled with a promise from Mr. McConnell to allow a vote on a measure to protect the Dreamers from deportation.

Mr. McConnell pledged Monday morning that he would create a “level playing field” on immigration next month if the issue had not been resolved by then. But his promise was not enough for many Democrats, and on Monday morning, moderate Senate Democrats were still pressing for more in exchange for their votes to end the shutdown.

By noon, just before the first vote to end debate on the spending bill, the moderate Democrats were predicting passage.

“We’re going to vote to reopen the government,” Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a Democrat whose state is home to thousands of federal workers, told reporters. Mr. Warner said there was now a “path clear on how we’re going to get a full-year budget and we got a path clear on how we’re going to start an immigration debate.”

Senator Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said he was a “strong” yes.

“I said before trust but verify,” he said of Mr. McConnell. “He made this commitment publicly in the Senate floor. He was much more specific than he was last night. And frankly I think this is an important opportunity for him to demonstrate that he will carry through.”

Here Are the Senators Who Brokered a Bipartisan Solution to the Government Shutdown

Trump: the Democrats “have come to their senses.”

“I am pleased that Democrats in Congress have come to their senses and are now willing to fund our great military, border patrol, first responders, and insurance for vulnerable children. As I have always said, once the Government is funded, my Administration will work toward solving the problem of very unfair illegal immigration. We will make a long-term deal on immigration if, and only if, it is good for our country.” — Statement released by the White House

White House insists Trump was part of the deal-making.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, insisted that the deal that the Senatevoted on was not “drastically different” than what was discussed on Friday between the president and Mr. Schumer.

Despite what was characterized by both parties as Mr. Trump’s invisibility this weekend, Ms. Sanders still insisted that he was responsible for making a deal happen.

“What the president did clearly worked,” she said, calling the numbers more in Mr. Trump’s favor “than in Senator Schumer’s favor.”

“The president stayed firm, Republicans stayed firm and Democrats Ithink realized that they had to move past that piece of legislation” in order to discuss immigration going forward, Ms. Sanders said.

But she declined to clarify precisely what the parameters of an immigration deal would look like. She dodged several questions about how many of the so-called dreamers might be eligible for what she called a “permanent solution” to their legal status, or how it might be put into effect, or when deportations of DACA recipients might begin.

“They say they want to negotiate so much so that they were willing to shut down the government,” Ms. Sanders said of Democrats in response to a specific question about when deportations would start.

She dodged a question about whether Mr. Trump had a role in dictating a web ad his campaign released over the weekend that said Democrats would be “complicit” in murders committed by undocumented immigrants. But she anticipated a full restoration of federal services by Tuesday morning.

White House official Marc Short credited the president with impacting the tide turning by calling into the House Freedom Caucus meeting on Thursday. He then - mostly - held to a script that his aides prescribed that blamed Democrats. The White House consistently said they believed Democrats in red states would be forced to come around.

But aides at the White House, many of whom had never lived through a shut down before, were unsure how to spend their time. A group of press aides considered sending volunteers to the Mall to clean up after the women’s rally on Saturday to highlight that the govenrment was shut, but they scuttled the plan when they found out that the Washington D.C. police were already doing it.

“Put this mess behind us.”

Mr. McConnell said on Monday morning that the Senate would move ahead with a scheduled procedural vote at noon on a proposal to fund the government through Feb. 8, and he urged his colleagues to put an end to the shutdown.

“Every day we spend arguing about keeping the lights on is another day we cannot spend negotiating DACA or defense spending or any of our other shared priorities,” Mr. McConnell said, referring to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the program put in place by the Obama administration that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation.

Mr. McConnell reiterated a pledge he offered on Sunday night that he intended for the Senate to take up immigration legislation in February if the issue has not been resolved by then. A major question as senators seek to end the shutdown is what kind of commitment Mr. McConnell is willing to make regarding the consideration of legislation for the young immigrants, a central issue in the current impasse.

On Monday, Mr. McConnell pledged that the Senate’s immigration debate would have “a level playing field at the outset and an amendment process that is fair to all sides.”

“The very first step is ending the government shutdown,” he said.

Democrats wanted more than McConnell’s word.

Moderate Senate Democrats Monday morning had sought a firmer commitment from Mr. McConnell that the Senate would move to address the fate of hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, in the coming weeks.

The Democrats were part of a bipartisan group of more than 20 senators working throughout the weekend to forge a compromise to reopen the government. Mr. McConnell signaled Sunday night that he was listening to their demands, saying from the Senate floor that he intended to move ahead with immigration legislation in February if the issue had not been resolved by then.

But on Monday, Democrats wanted more in exchange for the votes to end the shutdown.

“Well I think the first thing he needs to do is strengthen his statement from last night,” said Senator Angus King of Maine, an independent who votes with the Democrats. “ ‘I intend.’ I would much rather he say, ‘I commit’ or ‘I will move.’”

As senators from the group shuffled in and out of leadership offices, Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona and another member of the group, expressed optimism that such a public statement by Mr. McConnell would be enough to win over enough Democrats to vote to end the shutdown. Some Democrats called on Mr. McConnell to delay a procedural vote schedule for noon.

The crux issue, it seemed, was whether the majority leader could be trusted to keep his word. Democrats have not forgiven Mr. McConnell for blocking the Supreme Court nomination of Merrick Garland for almost a year pending the election of a Republican to the White House. And Mr. McConnell’s promises to Republican Senators Flake and Susan Collins of Maine for votes on health care and immigration in exchange for their support of the tax cut have yet to materialize.

How much of the issue is that mistrust?

“Uh, most of it,” said Senator Joseph Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia.

Liberal activists weren’t ready to relent.

A broad array of liberal advocacy groups — including unions and immigrants’ rights activists — stepped up pressure on Democrats not to accede on Monday to any deal that does not include protections for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers.

The advocates made clear that they do not trust Mr. McConnell.

“To anyone considering such a move, let me clear, promises won’t protect anyone from deportation, because delay means deportation for us,” said Greisa Martinez Rosas, advocacy director for America’s Voice, an immigrant rights group.

Moderate Senate Democrats on Monday were seeking a firmer commitment from Mr. McConnell. But the groups remained skeptical. Vanita Gutpta, the president and chief executive officer of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, harked back to Democrats’ vote on Friday to block a spending bill that would have kept the government open, without protecting the Dreamers.

“We’ve made it clear that the broad progressive movement is unified in saying the Democrats stood strong on Friday, they absolutely need to continue to do so,” Ms. Gupta said. She added, “Simply put a dream deferred right now is a dream denied for hundreds of thousands in our country.”

The Sierra Club’s executive director, Michael Brune, was blunt: “Everyone in the Senate should have learned the lesson Senators Flake and Collins learned: you can’t trust Mitch McConnell. His promises are empty from the start.”

— Sheryl Gay Stolberg

The White House comment line had an attitude.

On Monday morning, a telephone call to the White House comment line reminded callers that the federal government was shutdown and offered the Trump administration’s explanation for why: “Unfortunately, we cannot answer your call today because congressional Democrats are holding government funding for our troops and other national security priorities hostage to an unrelated immigration debate,” a recording said. “Due to this obstruction the government is shut down.”

Setting aside the partisan nature of the call, its message was only half true, if that. Most of the government is functioning, at least for now. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Federal Communications Commission say they have enough money in the pipeline to operate normally. The White House ordered the National Parks to stay open, depriving the media of the most obvious signs of dysfunction.

Even Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russia’s intervention in the 2016 election and any possible collusion with the Trump campaign, is still in action. He has declared his investigators “essential employees.”

But was the recording legal? Norm Eisen, who served as the top ethics lawyer during Barack Obama’s first term in the White House and is now on the board of the liberal Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said the message probably did not violate the Hatch Act, the statute that bars most executive branch employees from engaging in political activity. It certainly does run contrary to its policy, and therefore “would have been inconceivable in any other administration, of either party.”

“This telephone message falls in the very thin, gray area where this White House lives, which is quite a bit north of definitely wrong, but just south, or on the borderline, of illegal,” Mr. Eisen said.

He said it violated the longstanding norm observed by presidents in both parties that the White House staff, particularly nonpartisan career employees such as the person likely to have recorded the message, is there to serve all Americans, not just those who voted for him.

But the recording would be unlikely to generate a formal complaint, Mr. Eisen said, because no specific political candidate was mentioned. The White House changed the message as the Senate headed toward a deal.

White House shows signs it’s on the offense.

After a weekend of relative silence from the White House, Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, appeared on CNN to defend President Trump, who had been publicly criticized as disengaged on the negotiations and unduly influenced by his senior advisers.

“We’re happy with how the president engaged,” Mr. Shah said, before shifting blame to the Democrats. “It was them that were holding back funding for our military, our troops, our border patrol agents and our first responders.”

Mr. Shah also defended a president who has been publicly accused by lawmakers in his own party of deferring to Stephen Miller, the adviser who is ideologically behind much of the White House’s restrictive immigration agenda.

“Those charges are frankly ridiculous, and they’re a little insulting,” Mr. Shah said. “The views that the president is endorsing are his and his alone.”

Mr. Trump, a president prone to hit back against his critics in real time, remained relatively restrained on Monday, except to accuse Democrats of being cowed by activists who want a fast decision on the fate of the Dreamers.", Stopgap Bill to End Government Shutdown Passes Congress ,1-2018

WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.V.—President Donald Trump weighed in Thursday on the U.S. Senate Republican primary in West Virginia, inviting two of the GOP candidates to an event to discuss tax policy, but shunning a third, the former coal executive Don Blankenship.

The victor in the primary this fall will face Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat. Mr. Trump was seated Thursday between Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. The Republican president talked about a number of issues including immigration, the opioid crisis, coal, trade policy and gang violence.

The White House didn’t invite Mr. Blankenship, a former coal executive who served a year in prison on a charge of conspiring to violate mine-safety laws before a 2010 mine disaster, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Blankenship’s campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment. Thursday marked the eight-year anniversary of Massey Energy Co.’s Upper Big Branch Mine explosion that killed 29 people. Mr. Blankenship was CEO of Massey at the time. Mr. Trump attacked Mr. Manchin, a former West Virginia governor who faces a tough re-election fight in the conservative state, for not supporting legislation the White House backed on taxes and immigration. “We’re going to get a chance to have a senator that’s going to help our program,” the president said. Last year, Mr. Manchin regularly talked to Trump administration officials about developing a bipartisan tax bill, complaining that congressional Republicans had excluded Democrats from the tax talks. Mr. Manchin issued a statement late on Thursday that criticized the president for “political posturing.”

"INDIANAPOLIS, Indiana (Reuters) - Mike Braun, an Indiana businessman turned politician, rails against Washington, says he speaks for disaffected voters, and uses his personal wealth to help finance his bid for public office.

Any similarity to President Donald Trump is entirely intentional.

Braun, who owns a distribution and freight company, says he would not have launched his Republican effort for the U.S. Senate if Trump had not blazed the trail two years ago.

“I thought there was the opportunity to define a different kind of candidacy, one from the outsider business world, the same thing Trump did,” he told Reuters ahead of the primary vote on Tuesday.

Other Republican primary races in Ohio and West Virginia on Tuesday also feature outsider businessmen who have gone all out to show their allegiance to Trump and accuse their rivals of lacking the same fealty.

The three contests herald a wave of primaries in the coming weeks in critical states such as Pennsylvania, California, Iowa, and New Jersey that will help determine whether Democrats can pick up two seats in the Senate and 23 seats in the House of Representatives in November to take control of Congress.

The candidates also highlight a shift in the Republican Party to embrace more populist, nativist and protectionist candidates skeptical of immigration and free trade – a seismic change from the party’s traditional alliance of social conservatives and free-marketeers.

How those Trump-like candidates fare in coming primaries and November’s elections will indicate whether “Trumpism” remains a dominant force in the Republican Party heading into the 2020 presidential election.

Republican leaders are nervously watching the West Virginia primary where former coal executive Don Blankenship has centered his candidacy around attacking Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Blankenship accuses McConnell of undermining Trump and has run TV ads highlighting McConnell’s wife’s Taiwanese heritage, drawing widespread condemnation.

Blankenship served time in prison for safety violations connected to a 2010 disaster that killed 29 miners, and is viewed as the weakest choice to take on Democratic Senator Joe Manchin.

The other candidates in the race are U.S. Representative Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.

In Ohio, businessman Mike Gibbons is squaring off against U.S. Representative Jim Renacci to see who will challenge Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown in November. While Gibbons has played the Trump card, however, Renacci snagged the president’s endorsement.

To show how much he supports Trump, Gibbons, an investment banker, on Friday filed a defamation lawsuit against Renacci, alleging his campaign falsely claimed Gibbons is anti-Trump.

HOT RACE

Indiana is home to perhaps the bitterest Republican primary in the country, with all three candidates scrambling to show voters their Trump bona fides and face incumbent Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly in the November election.

Braun portrays himself as cut from Trump’s cloth and U.S. Representative Todd Rokita carries a cardboard likeness of Trump to campaign events and wears a cap adorned with Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again” in TV ads.

Last week, Rokita sponsored a resolution in the House demanding that Special Counsel Robert Mueller end his investigation unless he can show evidence that Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election.

And the third candidate, U.S. Representative Luke Messer, nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in the talks between North and South Korea.

“This is just the start of what President Trump can accomplish if he has the leaders that support him in Washington,” Messer told Reuters after a campaign event in Carmel, Indiana.

Braun’s campaign has labeled Messer and Rokita “swamp creatures” for the 12 years combined they have spent in the House. Trump often promises supporters he will “drain the swamp” in Washington, referring to career politicians and lobbyists.

Kyle Kondik, an analyst at the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said Messer and Rokita “are going out of their way to be pro-Trump in almost cartoonish fashion ... It’s kind of shameless.”

He said Republican voters likely will respond well to Braun’s lack of political experience but it is unclear whether he would be the best candidate to defeat Donnelly, considered to be among the most vulnerable Democrats in the nation.

Donnelly won his first term in 2012, when Democrats swarmed to the polls to re-elect President Barack Obama. He faces a far tougher challenge after Trump won Indiana by 19 percentage points in 2016.

Messer says Braun is flawed, pointing to his history of voting in Democratic primaries and suggesting he is not a reliable conservative.

Braun says he voted in Democratic primaries in the past because in his southern Indiana home Democrats held all the local offices.

He positions himself as in sync with the conservative Tea Party movement and has poured about $5.4 million of his own money in the race, according to federal records. Trump spent about $65 million of his own funds during his campaign.

Kondik said that Braun, as an unknown quantity, carries the most risk for his party against Donnelly, but he might also be able to bring in independents turned off by the other two conservatives.

“He has the most variance between risk and reward,” he said.", `Mini-Trump` candidates battle it out in Republican primaries ,5-2018
"ON TUESDAY, voters in four states head to the polls.

West Virginia features a three-way Republican primary to determine who will challenge Joe Manchin in this autumn’s senate race. For most of the 20th century, coal dominated West Virginia’s economy and Democrats dominated its politics. Democrats were the party of organised labour, and in few places was the right to organise bought with as much blood as in West Virginia. But over time, Appalachian coal mines grew less productive; today most coal is mined from open pits in Wyoming. The plummeting price of natural gas and renewables hastened America’s shift away from coal. Membership in the United Mine Workers, the state’s most powerful union, roughly halved from the 1950s to the early 21st century. It now represents less than 40% of all miners—and that’s not many people (as of 2016, America had more yoga teachers than coal miners).

Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor`s Picks.

At the same time—as union power and membership declined across America—the Democratic party grew more uniformly socially liberal: a terrible fit for staid, socially conservative West Virginia. In 2012 Barack Obama lost the Democratic primary to Keith Judd, who at the time happened to be living in a federal prison in Texarkana, Texas (West Virginia is the second-whitest state in America). Many in West Virginia remain convinced that ever-stricter environmental regulations killed their coal industry, though that is not true.

Though Mr Manchin doughtily hangs on as the state’s sole statewide Democrat, West Virginia is Trump country. The two mainstream Republican senate hopefuls, Evan Jenkins and Patrick Morrisey—a congressman and attorney-general, respectively—bashed each other to a pulp over which one was really a closet liberal: Mr Jenkins, who was a Democrat until 2013, or Mr Morrisey, who only moved to the state in 2006.

That let the third candidate, Don Blankenship, steal a march; recent polls show him leading. After an accident killed 29 people at a mine he owned, Mr Blankenship spent a year in prison for conspiring to violate federal mine-safety laws. He lives in Las Vegas and has praised China’s “dictatorial capitalism”, even as he has called Mitch McConnell’s father-in-law a “wealthy Chinaperson” and derided “Cocaine Mitch” and his “China family”. A PAC aligned with Mr McConnell has spent heavily against Mr Blankenship, and even Donald Trump junior urged West Virginians to reject him.

But nativism and McConnell-bashing may pay dividends on Tuesday. Democrats who cheer his victory because they think Mr Manchin will wipe the floor with him should recall the lessons of 2016, and be careful what they wish for.

The Republican senate primary in Indiana has also been a three-headed slugfest. Like West Virginia, Indiana is a Trump state with a Democratic senator, Joe Donnelly, elected on Mr Obama’s coattails, who now looks vulnerable. With little daylight on issues between the three—Luke Messer and Todd Rokita, both congressmen; and Mike Braun, a wealthy former state legislator—the campaign has centred on personal attacks.

Mr Rokita calls Mr Braun a “lifelong Democrat” and Mr Messer a “never Trumper”—a similar charge levelled by Mr Messer against Mr Rokita. Mr Braun, meanwhile, paints them both as DC swamp creatures—and he seems to be winning. As in West Virginia, Mr Braun’s appeal shows that the Republican base’s anti-establishment frenzy imperils elected Republicans just as much as it does Democrats. Whoever emerges from the mudpit on Tuesday will be less toxic than Mr Blankenship of West Virginia, and will present a formidable challenge to Mr Donnelly.

Donald Trump visited Ohio on Saturday to tout his tax reform, and ended up urging people to vote for Jim Renacci, leading a pack of five candidates in the Republican senate primary, though with a large share of voters still undecided. His leading rival is Mike Gibbons, a businessman from Cleveland. Predictably, the two are battling over which one of them loves Mr Trump more. Mr Gibbons has taken the unusual step of suing Mr Renacci’s campaign for calling him “anti-Trump”. The winner will face Sherrod Brown, Ohio’s rumpled Democratic senator and a dark-horse 2020 hopeful, in November.

But the more interesting Ohio primary is on the Democratic side, for governor. Richard Cordray, a former Ohio attorney general and the first head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is facing Dennis Kucinich, a former congressman, mayor of Cleveland and presidential candidate. Mr Cordray is dull, restrained and mainstream; Mr Kucinich is voluble and erratic, having defended both Mr Trump and Bashar al-Assad, Syria’s dictator.

Elizabeth Warren, a progressive senator from Massachusetts and possible 2020 presidential candidate, has endorsed Mr Cordray, while backers of Bernie Sanders favour Mr Kucinich (Mr Sanders himself has kept his distance). A victory for Mr Kucinich could signal that Democrats face their own anti-establishmentarians, who risk nominating candidates able to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Mr Cordray leads in the polls, though here too a large share of voters remain undecided.

There are four primary elections for the 2018 midterms on Tuesday, May 8, occurring in Ohio, Indiana, West Virginia and North Carolina.

The Republican Senate primaries in West Virginia and Indiana have become particularly heated contests, in which Trump-like candidates are doing all they can to come out on top.

The GOP is desperately hoping to maintain its majority in Congress come fall, which is precisely why there is so much chatter about these races in Washington.

Here`s a breakdown of what`s happening with these bloody Republican Senate primaries.

West Virginia

In West Virginia, incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin is widely expected to easily defeat his challenger, Paula Jean Swearengin.

The Republican Senate primary, however, is a far closer and more contentious race. The three candidates are Rep. Evan Jenkins, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, and the highly controversial Don Blankenship.

Blankenship is a former coal baron who ran a coal company and spent time in a federal prison after a mining disaster in 2010 that killed 29 people. The company he ran was found to be violating federal safety regulations.

Blankenship has ran a bombastic campaign in which he`s sought to paint himself an anti-establishment politician, much like President Donald Trump did during his 2016 campaign. In fact, on Monday, Blankenship referred to himself as ""Trumpier than Trump.""

Like Trump, Blankenship has also employed racially charged rhetoric, including in an ad that attacked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell`s ""China family.""

Blankenship has also spent a significant amount of money on campaign ads and has invaded West Virginia`s airwaves.

It initially looked like it would be a tight race between Jenkins and Morrisey, but Blankenship has been surging in the polls late in the game. This has been highly concerning to establishment Republicans like McConnell, who has reportedly urged Trump to step in and call on voters to go against Blankenship.

On Monday, Trump did just that, tweeting, ""To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can`t win the General Election in your State...No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey!""

Trump was seemingly referencing the failed Senate campaign of right-wing candidate Roy Moore in Alabama (while leaving out the fact he endorsed Moore).

Blankenship`s candidacy highlights the rift in the Republican Party between traditional conservatives and bellicose outsiders, who arguably have similarities to the president. Interestingly, Trump is seemingly open to opposing the latter in the hopes of maintaining Republican supremacy in Congress and to keep influential politicians like McConnell happy.

Indiana

In Indiana, incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly is running unopposed. But Republicans have a good chance of taking his seat, especially given Trump won by 19 points in Indiana.

With that said, the Republican field is quite messy. The three candidates are Rep. Todd Rokita, Rep. Luke Messer and Mike Braun, a businessman who previously served as a state lawmaker.

This primary has been particularly bloody and involved much in the way of personal attacks that have overshadowed any substantive debates over policy. Rokita, for example, went after Messer`s wife for taking a lucrative consulting job. In response, Messer accused Rokita of ""spreading lies."" There have also been attacks regarding mental health as well as former legal troubles, including DUIs, between the two.

Rokita and Messer have a decades-long rivalry that goes back to the fact they graduated from the same college, Wabash College, back in the 1990s.

All three candidates have attempted to link themselves to Trump in some way or another, perhaps in an effort to gain momentum in a state that heavily voted for the president.

Rokita recently sponsored a resolution in Congress calling for special counsel Robert Mueller to show definitive evidence Trump collude with Russia`s interference in the 2016 election or promptly end his investigation. And Messer recently called for Trump to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in pressuring North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions.

Meanwhile, Braun has attempted to portray himself as an anti-establishment candidate and an outsider from the world of business, much like Trump did in 2016.

Despite Rokita, Messer and Braun`s apparent efforts to win the president`s favor, he hasn`t endorsed anyone in Indiana.

A poll taken last month showed Braun in the lead, but many of those surveyed were undecided. In other words, it`s anybody`s game at this point."," The bloodiest Republican primaries to watch are in West Virginia and Indiana, where Trump-like candidates are battling it out to win ",5-2018

"MARY TAYLOR has been John Kasich’s lieutenant-governor since he was elected governor of Ohio in 2010. She backed all of his policies loyally, including the expansion of Medicaid and health insurance for the poor, and did not criticise Mr Kasich’s “Never Trump” campaign during his presidential candidacy. Yet when she campaigned to be the GOP candidate for the next governor of Ohio Ms Taylor claimed somewhat improbably that she had not talked to Mr Kasich in a year and that he had not endorsed her. Both claims were untrue, but Ms Taylor calculated she needed to distance herself from the Trump critic she had once served so dutifully, in order to win her party’s nomination for the governorship.

Ms Taylor’s gamble to recast herself as true Trumpian did not pay off. Mike DeWine, the attorney-general backed by the local GOP leadership, won the primary election on May 8th with 60% of the vote. The election was one of numerous primaries for November’s midterm elections in Ohio, where voters also decided on candidates for a Senate seat, 16 congressional seats, four other state-wide offices, including attorney-general and treasurer, judgeships and more. Primaries for the midterms were also held in neighbouring Indiana and West Virginia, both states Mr Trump won with a big margin, as well as in North Carolina. In all four states most GOP candidates tried to portray themselves as staunch followers of Mr Trump. He remains hugely popular with the Republican base, with job approval ratings of 85% or even more, according to some surveys.

Mr DeWine will face Richard Cordray a former Ohio attorney-general (pictured above) and the first head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, at the November election. Mr Cordray prevailed over Dennis Kucinich, a former congressman and mayor of Cleveland. Like Mr DeWine, Mr Cordray was the dependable establishment candidate, endorsed by Elizabeth Warren, a progressive senator from Massachusetts. Mr Kucinich was the quixotic erstwhile contender for the presidency backed by some fans of Bernie Sander. A gifted albeit eccentric orator, Mr Kucinich has defended both Mr Trump and Bashar al-Assad, Syria’s dictator, and was even paid by pro-Assad groups to give speeches.

The victories of Mssrs DeWine and Cordray are good news for the leadership of their respective parties; they are more electable than their radical rivals. “They were both careful not to alienate moderate voters,” says Bob Taft, a former governor of Ohio (and great-grandson of William Howard Taft, America’s 27th president). Mr DeWine kept at least some distance from Mr Trump by, for instance, not turning up when the president visited Cleveland, three days before the primaries. At his victory speech Mr DeWine and his running-mate, Jon Husted, made no mention of either Mr Kasich or Mr Trump. Mindful of many Midwestern voters’ attachment to the second amendment, Mr Cordray advocates only moderate gun-control policies. The Buckeye Firearms Association, a gun lobby, endorsed him in both 2006, when he ran for state treasurer, and in 2010, when he ran for attorney-general.

Ohio’s GDP leadership was also relieved that Joe Renacci, a former congressman, convincingly won the primary vote to stand for the Senate seat currently held by Sherrod Brown, a veteran Democrat who counts as one of the more unusual hopefuls for the 2020 presidential elections. Mr Renacci was endorsed by Mr Trump, who tweeted “I need Jim very badly to help our agenda and to keep MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! He will be a fantastic Senator for the Great State of Ohio, and has my full endorsement!"" Mr Renacci will still face an uphill battle against Mr Brown, who has been on the scene for 40 years, says Mark Weaver, a political strategist. A supporter of Mr Trump’s trade policies, Mr Brown is popular with blue-collar workers in a state that still owes a big chunk of its GDP to manufacturing.

Meanwhile in Indiana, a state Mr Trump won by 19 percentage points, the local Republican leadership was likewise hoping to get the candidate elected who is most likely to unseat a vulnerable Democratic senator, Joe Donnelly. Three candidates, politically almost identical, were slugging it out in a surprisingly nasty and expensive campaign: Luke Messer and Todd Rokita, both congressmen; and Mike Braun, a wealthy former state legislator. The campaign centred on personal attacks wherein candidates insulted each other with Trump-style nicknames. “Lyin’ Todd” for Mr Rokita, who claimed falsely that he had been endorsed by Mr Trump and Mike Pence, the vice-president. “Missing Messer”, for a congressman who allegedly spends more time in DC than in Indiana, and “Tax-Hike Mike”, because Mr Braun voted for an increase in petrol taxes as a state lawmaker. Mr Braun won, with 41% of the vote. In the sixth congressional district, Greg Pence, the vice-president’s oldest brother, handily won the race for the seat formerly held by the younger Mr Pence.

Primary voters are generally the most motivated and often the most radical voters. “Republican primary voters have grown increasingly suspicious of the party leadership over the past decade,” says Kyle Kondik of the University of Virginia. They tend to vote for candidates who are more conservative than their party leaders. Thomas Massie, a libertarian congressman from Kentucky, put it more bluntly. After some soul-searching last year he said he realised primary voters were not voting for his or anyone else’s libertarian ideals, but simply “for the craziest son-of-a-bitch in the race”.

Even so, primary voters tend to be better informed than voters at the general election—and reason seems to have prevailed more often than not in this round, as Republican and Democratic voters alike turned to the more electable candidates. West Virginian Republicans voted for Patrick Morrisey, the state attorney, in their Senate primary, rather than Don Blankenship, a former coal baron who spent time in prison for his role in the death of 29 coal miners. Mr Blankenship also called the father-in-law of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a “wealthy Chinaperson” and derided “Cocaine Mitch” and his “China family”. Mr Morrisey will face Joe Manchin, another vulnerable Democratic senator, in November.

The big exception to the election-day trend of rejecting the maverick came from North Carolina. There Mark Harris, a pastor who made his name denouncing same-sex marriage, defeated Robert Pittenger, a congressman. He will face Dan McCready, a well-funded businessman who won the Democratic nomination—in what is likely to be an especially unpredictable race come November.", The parties’ preferred primary candidates prevail ,5-2018
"Getty Images Spending by super PACs in races like West Virginia’s Senate contest, where Republicans are targeting Joe Manchin, could make 2018’s midterm election the most expensive in history.

The midterm congressional elections are six months away, but there are already signs that this year’s contests will be the costliest ever.

With a record number of candidates running for Congress, and passions running high among partisans on the right and left in the Trump era, experts say 2018 appears to be shaping up to notch another record.

“I expect 2018 to be the most expensive midterm election in U.S. history,” said Michael Toner, who was chairman of the Federal Election Commission during the George W. Bush administration.

Sarah Bryner, research director at the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit that tracks money in politics, agrees: “I would be very surprised if the 2018 midterms were not more expensive than 2014.” Bryner adds that she believes the 2018 total will also surpass what was spent on congressional races in 2016, when the presidential race was held concurrently.

Bryner credits “the incredible competitiveness of the House and Senate, and the incredible energy of the Trump base and the progressive left” with driving what she expects to be a new record.

Spending on the midterms has increased each cycle, in what Toner calls a “staircase phenomenon.” The 2014 contests’ cost of about $3.8 billion — a midterm record — topped the 2010 total of $3.6 billion, and so on, back through recent midterm-election years. Figures tallied by the Center for Responsive Politics include money spent by Senate and House candidates, political parties and independent interest groups.

Experts say it’s too early to ring up a total for what will be spent in 2018. But it appears likely to top $4 billion — putting the cost of the election in the same ballpark as what NASA spent on exploration in the last fiscal year; the amount paid by Walt Disney Co. DIS, +1.71% for Lucasfilm Ltd.; and the value of the New York Yankees, as estimated by Forbes last month.

One slice of data suggests the 2018 spending increase could be particularly dramatic.

Bryner took a look at what candidates have spent for the 2018 cycle to date, compared to the past couple of election cycles. The difference is major: through early May, House and Senate candidates have spent north of $745 million. Through May 28, 2014, by comparison, they’d shelled out close to $578 million.

In other words, spending to date by candidates is up 29% over the last time midterms were held.

That’s just one kind of spending that goes into elections; it doesn’t include what super PACs or parties shell out. Brendan Glavin, data manager for the Washington-based Campaign Finance Institute, similarly believes there will be “an uptick on the candidate side” in spending, due to the number of people running. But he says interest-group spending has the potential to jack up the total by much more.

“If we end up having very competitive Senate races, then that’s really going to play into whether we see more money being spent than in the past,” Glavin says.

University of Virginia pundits say seven of the 33 Senate seats up for regular election in 2018 are toss-ups, including in Florida, Indiana and Nevada. On the House side, Democrats need a net gain of 23 seats to retake the majority. Analyst Charlie Cook wrote this week that it’s premature to say the House GOP majority is toast, “but is it in very serious danger? Absolutely.”

Already, super PACs — which can raise unlimited amounts of money from corporations and unions — have started getting into races. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, for example, clinched his victory in Tuesday’s GOP Senate primary with help from 35th PAC, which compared fellow Republican Evan Jenkins to Democrat Joe Manchin. Manchin is a top target for Republicans in the fall, and one of the seven toss-ups on University of Virginia’s list. Watch an ad from 35th PAC:

On the House side, casino mogul Sheldon Adelson has cut a check for $30 million to the House Republican leadership-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund, Politico reported Thursday. CLF is a super PAC. Adelson’s contribution is three times as much as he gave the group in 2016, Politico said.

Super PAC spending, Toner suggests, is just getting started. “As a general rule, super PAC spending really increases in the summer and fall,” he says.

“I do expect record super PAC spending in 2018, no question,” says Toner."," Energy of Trump base, progressive left to drive midterm election spending to new records ",5-2018
"THIS autumn Democrats must defend ten Senate seats in states that President Donald Trump won. They may well flip Republican-held seats in Nevada and Arizona, so Republicans have to pick off at least a few of those ten seats if they want to retain their majority. Primary elections in three of these states—West Virginia, Indiana and Ohio, as well as North Carolina—were held on May 8th. Viable candidates prevailed in all three, partly by emphasising their affinity with Mr Trump. Yet even though Republicans control both houses of Congress and the White House, anti-establishment anger still animates their base.

The fear for what remains of the Republican establishment was that Don Blankenship would prevail in West Virginia, where Mr Trump won 68.5% of the vote in 2016. Mr Blankenship is a doughy, charmless ex-convict who praised China’s “dictatorial capitalism” and spent a year in prison for conspiring to evade federal mine-safety standards after an accident killed 29 men at one of his company’s mines. His campaign ads featured him staring into the camera while droning racist bilge. On the other hand, he hates the federal government and Mitch McConnell—whom he called “Cocaine Mitch”, and whose “China family” (Mr McConnell’s wife was born in Taiwan) he mocked. Though the president urged people to vote against him, Mr Blakenship claimed to be Trumpier than Trump.

To the relief of Republicans running in November, he lost West Virginia’s Senate primary to Patrick Morrisey, the state’s attorney-general (Mr McConnell’s gloating tweet read “Thanks for playing, Don,” and depicted the Senate majority leader smirking in a cloud of white powder). In November he faces Joe Manchin, who will be a tougher opponent than the state’s numbers hint. Mr Manchin is a populist Democrat and wily campaigner with deep local roots, whereas Mr Morrisey did not move to West Virginia until 2006; before that he lobbied for pharmaceutical firms in Washington, which could prove damaging in a state wracked by opioid deaths. Elsewhere in West Virginia, Richard Ojeda, a pro-gun, tattooed army veteran who passionately defended his state’s striking teachers, won the 3rd District’s Democratic primary.

Indiana’s three-way slugfest ended with Mike Braun, a wealthy businessman, prevailing over Luke Messer and Todd Rokita, both Republican congressmen. (Evan Jenkins, another Republican congressman also lost in West Virginia.) All three candidates tried to claim Mr Trump’s mantle while emulating his style, lambasting each other with derisive nicknames: “Lyin’ Todd” for Mr Rokita, who falsely implied that Mr Trump had endorsed him; “Missing Messer” for the congressman who allegedly spends more time in the Washington area than Indiana; and “Tax Hike Mike” for Mr Braun, who voted to raise the gas tax when he was a state legislator. Mr Braun will face Joe Donnelly, the Democratic incumbent, in November, in a state Mr Trump won by nearly 20 points.

In North Carolina’s 9th District, Robert Pittenger, the incumbent Republican congressman, lost to Mark Harris, whom he defeated in 2016. Mr Harris, a Baptist pastor who called his opponent a “Republican liberal”, will face Dan McCready, a well-funded former marine turned solar-power executive, in November. Though the 9th has been Republican for decades, it is the sort of suburban district that Democrats think they can flip—and indeed over 10,000 more Democrats than Republicans voted in the primary.

The sole bright spot for House Republicans was seen in Ohio, where Jim Renacci, who has represented Ohio’s 16th District since 2010, defeated Mike Gibbons, a banker from Cleveland, following an endorsement from Mr Trump. Mr Renacci hopes to oust Sherrod Brown, a populist Democrat who has held the Senate seat since 2007.

The Democratic centre held in Ohio’s primary for governor, where Richard Cordray, once head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, defeated Dennis Kucinich, a former congressman and presidential candidate, who has defended both Mr Trump and Bashar al-Assad. Elizabeth Warren endorsed Mr Cordray, while groups affiliated with Bernie Sanders backed Mr Kucinich. Mr Cordray will face Mike DeWine, who beat him in the race for attorney-general in 2010. A battle between two mainstream politicians may not thrill the fringes, but it will satisfy the centre—a welcome rarity in American politics.", Fringe candidates and House Republicans fare poorly ,5-2018

On the eve of Independence Day, President Donald Trump spoke at a ""Salute to Service"" dinner in West Virginia saluting the military, America`s history — and the work of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Trump spent most of his time at the Tuesday dinner, which was held in conjunction with a golf tournament at The Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, commemorating the Fourth of July and military service. He honored those who died to keep the nation safe and the founding fathers who created a new Republic.

Trump extolled on the joys of golf before turning political as he spoke of his upcoming Supreme Court pick and the firestorm centered on immigration. He spoke for 26 minutes.

Saying ""we want border security,"" Trump bashed Democrats and shut down those who have called for eliminating or curbing ICE amid of the controversy of separating migrant children from their families.

""We`re not abandoning ICE and we`re not abandoning our law enforcement,"" he told the crowd.

Trump said the men and women who work at the agency are ""tough people"" and compared their job to that of service members during a war.

""It`s like you`re liberating a town, like in a war. You`re liberating a town or an area,"" Trump said.

Standing in front of flags depicting branches of the military, Trump cited this year`s congressional elections in introducing local election officials. They included West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who is challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin.

Claiming that ""the polls have it very close,"" Trump told the crowd filled with veterans and professional golfers that ""you may be surprised"" by how well Morrisey does against Manchin, who did not attend the dinner.

Trump also discussed the economy, rebuilding the military, efforts to improve veterans health care, alleged ""fake news,"" and his proposed ""Space Force.""

He also teased to Monday`s planned announcement of a new Supreme Court justice, telling the crowd his pick will be a ""home run."" Over the last few days, Trump has interviewed several potential picks, including several women.

The owner of golf resorts also introduced some of the professional players in town for the tournament, including Bubba Watson, Keegan Bradley, John Daly, and Phil Mickelson. He told anecdotes about the golfers, and referred back to them at several points.

Noting that he won West Virginia by more than 40 percentage points in the 2016 election, Trump said, ""that`s like one of these genius golfers winning by 9.""

Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress in the Nov. 6 elections, which could impede Trump’s goals to clamp down on immigration, cut taxes, approve new bilateral trade deals, and invest in infrastructure.

Allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, have complicated his confirmation proceedings, disappointing conservative voters and energizing Democrats. Kavanaugh denies the accusations.

Trump travels first to Wheeling, West Virginia on Saturday, where Republicans are trying to unseat Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, one of a handful of senators seen as key swing votes that will determine Kavanaugh’s appointment.

Trump will then hold evening rallies in Johnson City, Tennessee on Monday; Southaven, Mississippi on Tuesday; Rochester, Minnesota on Thursday; and Topeka, Kansas next Saturday.

The Trump campaign said the rallies are aimed at energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.

“Control of Congress is so critical for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we head into the busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman said, declining to be named.

A third of the Senate and all House seats are in play. Power could shift if Democrats gain two Senate seats and 23 House seats.

Saturday’s visit will be Trump’s second in recent weeks to West Virginia - a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election - to campaign for Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing Manchin in polls.

“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.

Trump’s next two stops will be in states he also won handily in 2016: Tennessee, which he took by more than 20 points, and Mississippi, where he won by 18 points.

Tennessee’s former governor Phil Bredesen and U.S. Representative Marsha Blackburn are in a tight race for a Senate seat held by retiring Republican Bob Corker.

In Mississippi, two Republicans and two Democrats are in a special election primary battle for a Senate seat vacated by Republican Thad Cochran. Trump has endorsed Cindy Hyde-Smith, who would need to win 50 percent of the votes to avoid a run-off on Nov. 27.

Although Trump narrowly lost Minnesota in 2016, he won in Rochester, where he will be appearing on Thursday to support Republicans, including Karin Housley, who is running for the Senate, hoping to unseat Democrat Tina Smith.

"WHEELING, WVa. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday used the stalled nomination of his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as a rallying cry for Republican voters in November congressional elections.

At a West Virginia rally, Trump did not say a word about the testimony of university professor Christine Blasey Ford who detailed her sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh at an extraordinary hearing on Thursday.

After that hearing, Trump bowed to pressure from moderate Senate Republicans and ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation to further investigate.

Trump told supporters, who packed a hockey rink to the rafters for a raucous and freewheeling speech, that the delay showed why they need to vote against “mean and nasty and untruthful” Democrats in the Nov. 6 midterms.

“I will tell you, he has suffered. The meanness, the anger,” Trump said.

Trump was campaigning in a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election to try to boost support for Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing in polls behind Democratic Senator Joe Manchin.

Manchin is one of a handful of senators seen as key swing votes on Kavanaugh’s appointment.

It was the first of five rallies for Trump this week to energize supporters and volunteers ahead of Nov. 6 congressional elections, where Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress.

“A lot of what we’ve done - some people could say all of what we’ve done - is at stake in November,” Trump said, urging supporters to get involved.

“We are just five weeks away from one of the most important congressional elections in our lifetimes,” he said.

Kavanaugh’s troubled confirmation has disappointed conservative voters and energized Democrats.

Trump touted a poll done in West Virginia after the Senate hearing by the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative activist group that is backing Kavanaugh with a $1.5 million ad campaign.

The polling showed 58 percent of voters in the state want the confirmation to go ahead, while 28 percent are opposed.

"Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of California backed the unsuccessful GOP effort last year to begin repealing the Affordable Care Act, which guarantees coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions.

Now, in a bruising race against Democratic challenger Harley Rouda, Mr. Rohrabacher’s ads promise he will “protect America’s health care system,” stressing in particular his support for patients with such conditions.

Many Republicans, who swept to recent electoral victories by vowing to topple the ACA, are urgently seeking to reassure voters they want to save these protections. Mr. Rohrabacher says he is “taking on both parties” in an effort to do so; his challenger says the congressman is “falling all over himself to scrub his records on health care.”

Such fights are leading to sometimes bitter races across the country involving the ACA, enacted in 2010 under Democratic President Barack Obama.

About half of all Democratic campaign ads—roughly 345,400—had a health-care message through Sept. 30, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Kantar Media/CMAG data. About a quarter of those discussed pre-existing conditions, according to Kantar, an advertising tracking service.

Republican candidates are talking about health care far less. GOP ads touched on the subject in about 108,200 spots, Kantar said, with 5,310 of those mentioning pre-existing conditions.

Polls suggest Republicans are at a disadvantage on health issues for the first time in years. “They are more vulnerable,” said Robert Blendon, a political analyst and health policy professor at Harvard University. “What’s happened is that pre-existing conditions has gone from being a technical issue to an emotional one.”

About 130 million non-elderly people in the U.S. suffer from an existing medical condition, and a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 75% of voters consider it “very important” that the ACA’s provision guaranteeing such coverage remains law.

Democrats have seized on a lawsuit by 20 Republican-led states that seeks to invalidate the ACA as evidence of the GOP’s insensitivity. The Trump administration has weighed in on that case as well, asking that pre-existing condition protections, among others, be struck down.

Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) ran a recent ad in which he stands in a field, raises a rifle and fires at a copy of the lawsuit. He is campaigning against West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, one of the GOP officials bringing the case.

Democrats also stress that Republicans pushed to repeal the ACA last year. Republicans say they generally backed amendments or replacement plans to retain coverage for pre-existing conditions.

This year`s midterms have a new type of ad. It`s low budget, never airs on TV, and is helping unknown, novice candidates make headlines. Photo: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez/Means of Production

GOP candidates contend that Democrats are playing on voters’ fears. New premium data show that ACA insurance markets are stabilizing, they say, undercutting Democratic warnings that Republicans are trying to sabotage the health law.

“This is a scare tactic, and Americans who have pre-existing conditions should not worry about this,” Sen. Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.) said in an interview. “They’re making it up as they go along.”

The issue is a big concern for voters like Andrew Lee, who handles internal communications at an International Business Machines Corp. office in Bethesda, Md., and has been treated for kidney cancer.

He currently has coverage through his employer, but worries he could be prevented from ever becoming self-employed if insurers are allowed to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. “It’s a huge issue,” said Mr. Lee, 58 years old. “Until I go on Medicare, it limits my ability to retire early or work independently.”

Why Democrats Might Feel Good About the Midterms According to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News Poll, things have shifted in the Democrats direction, even though President Trump`s approval rating hasn`t changed. The WSJ`s Gerald F. Seib explains. Photo: Getty

Anna Ellis, 48, a marketing and financial consultant who lives near Nashville, Tenn., said her partner has diabetes and she worries about his ability to get coverage if the protections go away. She has delayed getting a physical because of concerns that something could be found that might endanger her coverage. “I’m concerned about it,” she said.

Some of the campaigns are becoming spirited. In Nevada, Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen is running an ad that says Republican Sen. Dean Heller is “lying” about backing pre-existing-condition protections, a charge his campaign denies.

"Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of California backed the unsuccessful GOP effort last year to begin repealing the Affordable Care Act, which guarantees coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions.

Now, in a bruising race against Democratic challenger Harley Rouda, Mr. Rohrabacher’s ads promise he will “protect America’s health care system,” stressing in particular his support for patients with such conditions.

Many Republicans, who swept to recent electoral victories by vowing to topple the ACA, are urgently seeking to reassure voters they want to save these protections. Mr. Rohrabacher says he is “taking on both parties” in an effort to do so; his challenger says the congressman is “falling all over himself to scrub his records on health care.”

Such fights are leading to sometimes bitter races across the country involving the ACA, enacted in 2010 under Democratic President Barack Obama.

About half of all Democratic campaign ads—roughly 345,400—had a health-care message through Sept. 30, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Kantar Media/CMAG data. About a quarter of those discussed pre-existing conditions, according to Kantar, an advertising tracking service.

Republican candidates are talking about health care far less. GOP ads touched on the subject in about 108,200 spots, Kantar said, with 5,310 of those mentioning pre-existing conditions.

Polls suggest Republicans are at a disadvantage on health issues for the first time in years. “They are more vulnerable,” said Robert Blendon, a political analyst and health policy professor at Harvard University. “What’s happened is that pre-existing conditions has gone from being a technical issue to an emotional one.”

About 130 million non-elderly people in the U.S. suffer from an existing medical condition, and a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 75% of voters consider it “very important” that the ACA’s provision guaranteeing such coverage remains law.

Democrats have seized on a lawsuit by 20 Republican-led states that seeks to invalidate the ACA as evidence of the GOP’s insensitivity. The Trump administration has weighed in on that case as well, asking that pre-existing condition protections, among others, be struck down.

Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) ran a recent ad in which he stands in a field, raises a rifle and fires at a copy of the lawsuit. He is campaigning against West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, one of the GOP officials bringing the case.

Democrats also stress that Republicans pushed to repeal the ACA last year. Republicans say they generally backed amendments or replacement plans to retain coverage for pre-existing conditions.

GOP candidates contend that Democrats are playing on voters’ fears. New premium data show that ACA insurance markets are stabilizing, they say, undercutting Democratic warnings that Republicans are trying to sabotage the health law.

“This is a scare tactic, and Americans who have pre-existing conditions should not worry about this,” Sen. Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.) said in an interview. “They’re making it up as they go along.”

The issue is a big concern for voters like Andrew Lee, who handles internal communications at an International Business Machines Corp. office in Bethesda, Md., and has been treated for kidney cancer.

He currently has coverage through his employer, but worries he could be prevented from ever becoming self-employed if insurers are allowed to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. “It’s a huge issue,” said Mr. Lee, 58 years old. “Until I go on Medicare, it limits my ability to retire early or work independently.”

Why Democrats Might Feel Good About the Midterms According to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News Poll, things have shifted in the Democrats direction, even though President Trump`s approval rating hasn`t changed. The WSJ`s Gerald F. Seib explains. Photo: Getty

Anna Ellis, 48, a marketing and financial consultant who lives near Nashville, Tenn., said her partner has diabetes and she worries about his ability to get coverage if the protections go away. She has delayed getting a physical because of concerns that something could be found that might endanger her coverage. “I’m concerned about it,” she said.

Some of the campaigns are becoming spirited. In Nevada, Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen is running an ad that says Republican Sen. Dean Heller is “lying” about backing pre-existing-condition protections, a charge his campaign denies.

In California, Mr. Rohrabacher’s ad cited his daughter’s leukemia diagnosis, showing photos of her in the hospital, while the congressman vows to fight for people with pre-existing conditions and says he is “using my heart as well as my head.”

Mr. Rouda, his challenger, responded with a statement saying in part, “Like all members of Congress, Dana and his family have Cadillac health care that covers pre-existing conditions…. We know you’ve worked to rip away health care from millions of Americans.”

"State Attorney General Patrick Morrisey is the Republican challenging incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin in West Virginia.

Morrisey is branding himself as the “polar opposite” of Manchin, who regularly touts his bipartisan work in the Senate.

President Donald Trump won the state of West Virginia by nearly 50 points in 2016, which Morrisey believes is his ticket to unseat Manchin.

CHARLESTON, West Virginia – “I’m the polar opposite of flip-flopper Joe Manchin,” Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey told an audience of about two dozen factory workers on Thursday.

“Literally, you should go online and see this. If you go online you start to see the memes – of Joe Manchin holding two different placards. Within three weeks, one saying he stands for Planned Parenthood and the other saying he stands for life. On the issue of life, you cannot have it both ways.”

Morrisey is running on being the anti-Joe Manchin in West Virginia, railing against the incumbent Democrat senator’s record of bipartisanship and often contentious voting choices. But Manchin is using that bipartisan aura to get him across the finish line in one of the hottest Senate races of the 2018 midterm elections.

For Morrisey, who for much of his career as state attorney general made a name for himself by suing and combatting the Obama administration, the race is about unseating a man he wants to paint as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s puppet.

Though Manchin votes in line with President Donald Trump’s policies more often than he does with Democrats (60.8% according to tracking by FiveThirtyEight), Morrisey says it is an effort to obstruct and “empower impeachment.”

Morrisey made it clear, through campaign stops and in an interview with Business Insider, that he is not like Manchin. Decisions won’t be up in the air until the final minutes of crucial votes, many topics will be non-negotiable, and perhaps most importantly for Morrisey, he has Trump’s stamp of approval.

“I think people are enthusiastic. They’re fired up,” he told Business Insider. “Because the stakes of this election are very high. West Virginia is at a critical juncture for control of the US Senate. Win in West Virginia, and we can put an end to this talk about having impeachment, obstruction, resistance.”

Trump won West Virginia in 2016 by nearly 68 points, compared to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s abysmal 26. Morrisey and his supporters are counting on that to put him over the top. But that challenge has proven more difficult compared to other competitive races where Democrats are up for re-election in conservative-leaning states.

Manchin is banking on the appeal of bipartisanship

However you frame it, Manchin has a well-known reputation in Washington and nationally as one of the least liberal or most conservative Democrats in the Senate. He voted for both of Trump’s Supreme Court nominees, but against the tax cuts. Pick an issue and it’s hard to pinpoint exactly where he voted without looking it up.

“The people know who I am and I sure know West Virginia because I am West Virginia,” Manchin told Business Insider. “I think that’s the difference.”

On Wednesday, Manchin published four separate op-eds co-bylined with Republican senators across several West Virginia newspapers. Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, and Marco Rubio of Florida all touted bipartisan work on key issues like health care and energy.

Having members of the opposite party go to bat for you in the final stretch of a campaign is support you can’t buy and praise you can only earn, Manchin said.

“I’ve never campaigned against a Republican in the center, I’ve never given money to a Democrat that’s running against a Republican in the Senate for incumbents,” he said. “I don’t think it should be done. I used to hear that’s the way it was done before. It’s an unwritten rule – you don’t do that.”

But Morrisey sees that as a problem. He knows he’s the right winger in the race and hopes everyone else in West Virginia takes notice.

“Everyone who follows the race knows I’m the conservative fire who’s going to advance the Trump jobs agenda and Joe Manchin’s a dishonest Washington liberal, who’s going to empower the impeach, obstruct, and resist circus in DC,” Morrisey told Business Insider. “And the more people see that, through the ads, through the appearances, then we’re going to allow us to come out on top.”

“Whether we’re talking about the Trump tax cuts, the deregulating, and the Trump judges, there’s so much good that’s being done right now we can’t go back,” he added.

Manchin said he “could understand that Patrick Morrisey would be envious” of his support from Republicans. “Because that’s not who he is.”

In agreement with Morrisey on how bipartisanship can be an obstacle to the Republican agenda is Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who hit the campaign trail in West Virginia in an attempt to bolster enthusiasm for unseating Manchin.

“Here’s the thing, the other senator, the one you’ve got now, says, ‘Oh I’m bipartisan! I’m for both sides!`” Paul said of Manchin. “Well he’s for all the bad ideas that come from both sides.”

But Manchin laughed off support from Paul, saying, “that helps me.”

“I’m glad Rand came here because I don’t think Rand’s that popular in West Virginia or in that part of Kentucky,” he said.

The calvary is coming in for Morrisey in the final two and a half weeks until Election Day. Vice President Mike Pence is stumping for Morrisey on Saturday, with personalities like Donald Trump Jr. to follow on Monday.

“Mike Pence, I know Mike Pence and he’s just – I guess – doing his job,” Manchin said. “Well he’s a junkyard dog right now I guess. He has to go out and do it. And then they send Donald [Trump] Jr. God bless you, come on in.”

“I’d rather have Jerry West. I’d rather have Bob Huggins. I’d rather have Nick Saban,” Manchin said in reference to a recent ad touting support from the sports legends. “I’ll take those three over those three any day.”", Republican Patrick Morrisey is betting that bipartisanship is dead in his Senate race against Democrat Joe Manchin in deep-red West Virginia ,10-2018
"Healthcare is emerging as one of the dominant issues in the 2018 midterm elections.

In particular, protections for people with preexisting conditions has become a key point of debate between Democrats and Republicans.

Democrats argue the GOP`s attempts to repeal Obamacare would have undermined preexisting condition protections.

Republicans say they want to protect preexisting conditions while providing more choices for consumers.

Complicating the matter is a pending lawsuit against the ACA brought by 20 Republican state attorneys general.

Polls show that voters trust Democrats more on the issue.

Healthcare is at or near the top of many Americans` lists of the most important issues in the 2018 midterm elections.

And the healthcare fight between the two parties seems to be coming down to one issue in particular: protections for people with preexisting conditions.

Democrats are hammering their GOP opponents, arguing the Republican`s repeated attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act would have undermined protections for sicker Americans. The GOP argues that preexisting condition protections have always been a part of their healthcare platform.

President Donald Trump last week pledged that all Republicans believe — or would believe — in protecting people with preexisting conditions.

""All Republicans support people with pre-existing conditions, and if they don’t, they will after I speak to them,"" Trump tweeted Thursday. ""I am in total support.""

Here`s what the preexisting condition fight is about

Prior to the Affordable Care Act becoming law, insurers were able to deny people coverage due to a preexisting condition in many states. And in most states, even if insurers did offer plans to sick people, the companies could drive up premiums for people with preexisting conditions.

The ACA`s preexisting condition protections mostly helped people in the individual health insurance market — Americans who did not receive coverage from a job or a government program like Medicaid.

The ACA created two major preexisting condition protections that were created under the ACA:

Guaranteed issue: This provision made it so insurers were compelled to offer insurance to people with preexisting conditions. Community rating: This prevents insurers from charging people with preexisting conditions much higher rates than healthy people and pricing those people out of the market.

While Republicans called for the complete repeal of Obamacare, many eventually recognized the popularity of the preexisting condition protections.

The GOP adopted guaranteed issue as part of their policy, but community rating got a bit trickier in the rollout of the American Health Care Act — the House GOP`s proposed ACA replacement:

Under the AHCA, states could apply for waivers that would weaken the community rating provision and allow insurers to charge based on health status — such as a preexisting condition — if a person did not maintain continuous insurance coverage.

States that received waivers could apply for funding to help alleviate the increased costs for people with preexisting conditions.

But many health policy experts viewed the amount of funding set out under the AHCA as inadequate. They warned that increased cost to sick Americans would result in many people with preexisting conditions being priced out of the market altogether .

priced out of the market altogether According to a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy think tank, the AHCA could have left as many as 6 million people with preexisting conditions without coverage.

Democrats argued the inclusion of the waivers showed the GOP would unnecessarily weaken protections for people with preexisting conditions, while Republicans said the law was designed to protect sick Americans while also driving down costs for healthier people in the Obamacare marketplaces.

The looming lawsuit

Clouding the midterm fight is a pending lawsuit brought by the Texas attorney general that could fully undo Obamacare`s preexisting conditions protections.

The Texas attorney general and 19 other Republican state attorneys general are arguing in federal court that since the GOP`s tax law effectively repealed Obamacare`s mandate that all people buy insurance, it is now unconstitutional. The AGs further argue that if the mandate is unconstitutional then all of Obamacare — including the popular protections — are also unlawful.

The lawsuit has puts many Republican candidates in a bind as their states actively attempt to repeal the preexisting conditions in court while they try to convince voters of their desire to uphold those same protections.

Two GOP senate candidates — Josh Hawley in Missouri and Patrick Morrisey in West Virginia — are the attorneys general in their states and are signed onto the lawsuit. Democrats Claire McCaskill and Joe Manchin — the incumbents in Missouri and West Virginia, respectively — have hammered their counterparts on the issue and it could help them hold their seats in otherwise red states.

Manchin even dramatically shot a copy of the lawsuit with a gun in a eye-catching campaign ad released in September.

Republicans scramble to win over voters

According to a poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation released Friday, 58% of Americans say they more trust Democrats to continue preexisting condition protections, while just 26% of people say they more trust Republicans. Other polls have shown a similar trend.

Given the discrepancy, Democrats are leaning into the issue:

54.5% of all Democratic ads feature healthcare as the main issue, according to the Wesleyan Media Project.

Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi doubled down on the party`s healthcare message in a joint statement Saturday. "" Democrats are focused like a laser on health care and will not be diverted,"" the top Democrats said.

But amid the flood of healthcare ads from Democrats, the GOP has attempted to fight back. Many candidates are pointing to their personal experiences with family members that have a preexisting condition and leaning on the AHCA`s guaranteed-issue provision as proof that the party wants to provide coverage for people with preexisting conditions — while also providing choice.", Republicans tried to kill Obamacare. Now they`re trying to embrace its most popular feature in a defining fight of the midterms. ,10-2018
"(Reuters) - From suburbs to conservative rural areas, Democrats seeking a majority in at least one house of the U.S. Congress in next week’s elections are spending the last days of the campaign on one message: They will protect Americans’ healthcare coverage.

The strategy is clear in campaigns like that of Democrat Andy Kim, who has spent the past 16 months trying to unseat Republican U.S. Congressman Tom MacArthur of southern New Jersey for his role in passing a House of Representatives bill that would have repealed the 2010 Affordable Care Act.

That effort failed in the Senate by a single vote following dozens of Republican votes over the years to repeal former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature domestic law, popularly known as Obamacare. Democrats warn that if Republicans keep control of Congress in Tuesday’s elections, people could lose coverage for pre-existing health conditions and other protections afforded by the law.

MacArthur is one of 67 vulnerable Republican incumbents who have voted to repeal Obamacare. If they lose their seats, it will be partly because of voters like Laurel Smith, who has a son with a rare genetic disorder. She voted for MacArthur in both 2014 and 2016 before he authored a last-minute amendment that resuscitated the repeal effort in the House in May 2017.

“I voted for Tom MacArthur because I truly believed he was the best person for the job,” said Smith, 58, from Medford, New Jersey. “I’ve never been so disappointed in my life.”

Democrats’ focus on healthcare extends beyond House races to key gubernatorial and Senate races, including contests in deeply conservative states where Republican President Donald Trump won by double-digit margins in 2016.

The strategy is a sharp shift for Democrats, who were wary of defending Obamacare in previous election years when the law was unpopular with many voters.

Democrats are favored to flip the 23 seats they need to secure a House majority, although they are considered a long shot to pick up the two seats needed to take over the Senate.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll polling.reuters.com/#!response/TR112/type/week/dates/20181001-20181030/collapsed/true of 2,673 Americans conducted Oct. 1 through Oct. 28 found healthcare was the top issue on the minds of Democratic and independent voters heading into the elections, and third in priority among Republicans, behind immigration and the economy.

It is a factor in races across the country, including Arizona where Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick is seeking to flip a Republican seat in a congressional district covering much of Tucson and return to the House.

First elected to Arizona’s 1st Congressional District in 2008, she was defeated in her 2010 re-election bid mostly because, she said, of negative reaction to her vote for Obamacare.

Now running in the 2nd Congressional District, she believes the picture has changed.

“I hear from people, ‘Please don’t repeal the Affordable Care Act,’” Kirkpatrick said in an interview.

Her Republican opponent, Lea Marquez Peterson, supports replacing Obamacare with “piecemeal” provisions that offer businesses and insurance providers more flexibility.

“What we have now is not working,” Marquez Peterson said in an interview.

TRUMP TAKES ON ISSUE

Vulnerable Democratic senators in states won by Trump are also focusing on the issue. Among them is Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, who has criticized her Republican challenger, state Attorney General Josh Hawley, for joining a lawsuit filed by Republican attorneys general seeking to overturn Obamacare.

Trump, who vowed throughout his campaign to repeal the Affordable Care Act and fumed when the effort failed, is due in Missouri on Thursday, the second stop on his six-day campaign tour of battleground states.

On Friday, he will travel to West Virginia, which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016. The state’s Democratic senator, Joe Manchin, has attacked his opponent, Republican state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, for participating in the same lawsuit joined by Hawley.

Republicans have argued that they are also committed to maintaining those protections, drawing accusations of hypocrisy from Democrats and healthcare experts who say the repeal of Obamacare would have sent premiums skyrocketing for certain people with pre-existing conditions.

Last week, Trump tweeted that Republicans would “totally protect people with Pre-Existing Conditions, Democrats will not!”

Former Vice President Joe Biden may also address the issue in a Thursday campaign appearance in North Dakota with embattled Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp.

‘SUPER PASSIONATE’

Democrats are hoping healthcare can help them draw in young voters like Bianey Diaz, a student at LaGrange College in Georgia, who attended a recent rally held by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who will be joined at campaign events on Thursday by Oprah Winfrey.

“I’m really super passionate about pre-existing conditions – that’s the big thing with personal experience in my own family and friends, loved ones,” Diaz said.

The New Jersey race between MacArthur and Kim, a former national security adviser in Obama’s administration, is a virtual tie, according to recent polls. In 2016, MacArthur won re-election by 20 percentage points, while Trump carried the district by 6 points.

At a Wednesday night debate, Kim again excoriated MacArthur for the Obamacare repeal amendment he wrote that would have “gutted” pre-existing conditions protections by making costs for those patients prohibitively expensive.

Claire McCaskill, D-MO, takes a break during the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Kavanaugh of a sexual assault in 1982, in Washington, U.S., September 27, 2018.

“This is personal,” Kim said. “This is not about politics.”

MacArthur countered that the amendment specifically guaranteed protections for pre-existing conditions.

“You continue to say things like that that you know are dishonest,” he said."," In U.S. campaign homestretch, Democrats focus on healthcare ",11-2018
"MIAMI (Reuters) - Republican U.S. President Donald Trump and his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama were set to sketch out sharply contrasting visions of the nation’s future on Friday in bids to stir voter enthusiasm ahead of elections that will determine control of Congress.

In the run-up to Tuesday voting, Trump has hammered relentlessly on his hard-line immigration theme in his frequent rallies supporting Republican candidates, painting a grim and sometimes misleading impression of his rivals’ political goals. Obama, who is due to campaign for African-American gubernatorial candidates in two Southern states, has decried the “politics of division.”

Obama appears first, in Miami with gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, who faces former congressman Ron DeSantis, a strong Trump backer, and U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, who is being challenged by the outgoing governor, Rick Scott. A Reuters/Ipsos/UVA Center for Politics poll this week showed both Democrats leading with voter enthusiasm for Gillum, the young and liberal Tallahassee mayor, appearing to help Nelson and other Democratic candidates on the ballot.

Trump is set to back Republican challengers to incumbent Democratic U.S. senators in West Virginia and Indiana, states he won in the 2016 presidential election.

Opinion polls and non-partisan forecasters generally show Democrats as having strong chances of winning 23 additional seats and taking a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, which they could use to launch investigations into Trump’s administration and block his legislative agenda.

Republicans are generally expected to retain control of the U.S. Senate, whose powers include confirming Trump’s nominations to lifetime seats on the Supreme Court.

Interest in the vote has been unusually high for a year when Congress but not the White House is at stake, according to early voting tallies. More than 27 states have recorded more early votes at this point in the campaign than they did in all of 2014, according to The Election Project at the University of Florida, which tracks early turnout.

Texas had already recorded more votes than it did in all of 2014, including Election Day, the group said.

After Miami, Obama will head to Georgia to campaign for Stacey Abrams, a former state legislator aiming to become the United State’s first black female governor.

Obama’s challenge will be motivating the diverse coalition of voters who elected him in 2008 and 2012 but failed to turn out in as large numbers in 2016, said Patrick Hickey, a professor of political science at West Virginia University.

“Hillary Clinton lost because the Obama coalition didn’t show up at the polls – he’s trying to mobilize folks who like him and trust him in Georgia and Florida,” Hickey said.

In West Virginia, Trump will campaign for a third time with Patrick Morrisey, who aims to unseat Democratic Senator Joe Manchin.

Two new polls this week showed Manchin’s once-comfortable lead over Morrisey dwindling to 5 percentage points, which the Democrat’s supporters blame in part on Trump’s repeated visits.

“I know Trump coming so often is making an impact,” said Jim Hoyt, chairman of the Morgan County Democratic Party in northeast West Virginia. Like other Democrats in the state, he still expects Manchin to win.

Trump also will go to Indiana to appear on behalf of Mike Braun, who is trying to replace Joe Donnelly in the Senate.

Interest in the vote has been unusually high for a year when Congress but not the White House is at stake, according to early voting tallies. More than 27 states have recorded more early votes at this point in the campaign than they did in all of 2014, according to The Election Project at the University of Florida, which tracks early turnout.

Texas had already recorded more votes than it did in all of 2014, including Election Day, the group said.

After Miami, Obama will head to Georgia to campaign for Stacey Abrams, a former state legislator aiming to become the United State’s first black female governor.

Obama’s challenge will be motivating the diverse coalition of voters who elected him in 2008 and 2012 but failed to turn out in as large numbers in 2016, said Patrick Hickey, a professor of political science at West Virginia University.

“Hillary Clinton lost because the Obama coalition didn’t show up at the polls – he’s trying to mobilize folks who like him and trust him in Georgia and Florida,” Hickey said.

In West Virginia, Trump will campaign for a third time with Patrick Morrisey, who aims to unseat Democratic Senator Joe Manchin.

Two new polls this week showed Manchin’s once-comfortable lead over Morrisey dwindling to 5 percentage points, which the Democrat’s supporters blame in part on Trump’s repeated visits.

“I know Trump coming so often is making an impact,” said Jim Hoyt, chairman of the Morgan County Democratic Party in northeast West Virginia. Like other Democrats in the state, he still expects Manchin to win.

Trump also will go to Indiana to appear on behalf of Mike Braun, who is trying to replace Joe Donnelly in the Senate.

"MIAMI (Reuters) - Republican U.S. President Donald Trump and his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama were set to sketch out sharply contrasting visions of the nation’s future on Friday in bids to stir voter enthusiasm ahead of elections that will determine control of Congress.

In the run-up to Tuesday voting, Trump has hammered relentlessly on his hard-line immigration theme in his frequent rallies supporting Republican candidates, painting a grim and sometimes misleading impression of his rivals’ political goals. Obama, who is due to campaign for African-American gubernatorial candidates in two Southern states, has decried the “politics of division.”

Obama appears first, in Miami with gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, who faces former congressman Ron DeSantis, a strong Trump backer, and U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, who is being challenged by the outgoing governor, Rick Scott. A Reuters/Ipsos/UVA Center for Politics poll this week showed both Democrats leading with voter enthusiasm for Gillum, the young and liberal Tallahassee mayor, appearing to help Nelson and other Democratic candidates on the ballot.

Trump is set to back Republican challengers to incumbent Democratic U.S. senators in West Virginia and Indiana, states he won in the 2016 presidential election.

For all Reuters election coverage, click: here"," Busy day of campaigning for Trump, Obama ahead of key U.S. elections ",11-2018
"INDIANAPOLIS/MIAMI (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Barack Obama warned on Friday against rhetoric he said was meant to sow fear as he campaigned in support of Democratic candidates while President Donald Trump hammered a hardline anti-immigration message to energize Republicans.

In a packed day of campaigning ahead of Tuesday’s congressional midterm elections, Trump continued a blitz of rallies urging voters to keep his Republican Party in control of Congress, while Democrats appeared to notch a win in their efforts to halt the spread of misinformation online.

Twitter Inc said it had deleted more than 10,000 automated accounts posting messages that discouraged people from voting in Tuesday’s elections and wrongly appeared to be from Democrats, after the party flagged the misleading tweets to the social media company.

The removals took place in late September and early October.

Obama hit on a common theme of Democratic campaigns - defending his signature 2010 healthcare law, while urging Americans not to embrace hostility and division in politics.

“We have seen repeated attempts to divide us with rhetoric designed to make us angry and make us fearful,” Obama said in Miami. “But in four days, Florida, you can be a check on that kind of behaviour.”

Obama was flanked by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, who faces former congressman and strong Trump backer Ron DeSantis, and Senator Bill Nelson, who is being challenged by the outgoing governor, Rick Scott.

Trump’s campaign stops were aimed at bolstering Republicans challenging incumbent Democratic senators in West Virginia and Indiana, states he won in the 2016 presidential election.

Speaking on behalf of Mike Braun, who is trying to replace Joe Donnelly in the Senate, Trump told a rally in Indianapolis:

“If you want prosperity for your family, safety for your children and security for your country, vote for Mike Braun.”

Trump was joined on stage by former Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight, who led the crowd in a cheer “Go get’em Donald.”

Opinion polls and non-partisan forecasters generally show Democrats with strong chances of winning 23 additional seats and taking a majority in the House of Representatives, which they could use to launch investigations into Trump’s administration and block his legislative agenda.

Republicans are favoured to retain control of the Senate, whose powers include confirming Trump’s nominations to lifetime seats on the Supreme Court.

Obama’s speech was repeatedly interrupted by hecklers, prompting him to quip: “Why is it that the folks who won the last election are so mad all the time?”

SURGING EARLY VOTING

Interest in the election has been unusually high in a year when Congress but not the White House is at stake, according to early voting tallies. Twenty-seven states plus the District of Columbia have recorded more early votes at this point in the campaign than they did in all of 2014, according to The Election Project at the University of Florida, which tracks turnout.

Texas had already recorded more votes than it did in all of 2014, including Election Day, the group said.

After Miami, Obama was headed to Georgia to campaign for Stacey Abrams, a former state legislator aiming to become the nation’s first black female governor.

That race pitting Abrams against Republican Brian Kemp, the state’s top elections overseer, has become a flashpoint for allegations of voter suppression by Democrats due to the state’s strict voter-identification law. Republicans say the law is necessary to deter voter fraud.

A federal judge on Friday ordered the state to allow some 3,000 recently naturalized citizens to vote after their registrations had been put on hold.

With the race neck and neck, voter turnout will be crucial, said Georgia State University political scientist Lakeyta Bonnette-Bailey. Obama could energize Democratic voters and drive up turnout, she added.

“At this point it’s going to be turnout,” she said. “How can he mobilize those who are already registered to vote to go out and vote. And to tell their friends and families to vote.”

The final weeks of the campaign have also seen a spate of violence including the massacre of 11 people at a Pennsylvania synagogue and more than a dozen package bombs sent to prominent Trump critics.

The FBI said on Friday it had recovered a suspicious package addressed to California billionaire Tom Steyer, a Democrat known for his ads calling for Trump’s impeachment.

In West Virginia, Trump’s third visit in three months was aimed at shoring up Patrick Morrisey, who is seeking to unseat Democratic Senator Joe Manchin.

Two new polls this week showed Manchin’s once-comfortable lead over Morrisey dwindling to 5 percentage points, which the Democrat’s supporters blame in part on Trump’s repeated visits.

"BELGRADE, Mont. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump touted U.S. economic growth and his nationalist policies as he rallied with Republican candidates ahead of Tuesday’s U.S. congressional elections as Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden urged voters to reject division.

Control of both houses of the U.S. Congress, currently dominated by Republicans, and 36 governors’ offices will be at stake when Americans vote in Tuesday’s elections. Interest has been unusually high for a non-presidential election year, with early voting running well ahead of past cycles.

Opinion polls and nonpartisan forecasters generally show Democrats with a strong chance of taking the 23 additional seats they would need for a majority in the House of Representatives, which they could use to launch investigations into Trump’s administration and block his legislative agenda.

Republicans are favored to retain control of the Senate, whose powers include confirming Trump’s nominations to lifetime seats on the Supreme Court.

“America is booming. Republicans passed a massive tax cut for working families and we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle class,” Trump said, standing in a Belgrade, Montana, airfield with Air Force One as a backdrop.

Last December, Trump signed into law the largest tax overhaul since the 1980s, which slashed the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and temporarily reduced the tax burden for most individuals as well.

The appearance was intended to boost the campaign of Matt Rosendale, the Republican state auditor challenging Democratic U.S. Senator Jon Tester. Trump called out Tester for his vote against his most recent Supreme Court nominee, saying “what he did was terrible.”

Republicans in many competitive suburban districts have tried to focus their campaign messages on the robust economic growth, though in his campaign appearances Trump has also focused on his hard-line immigration stance as he looks to stem the illegal and legal flow of people into the United States.

Biden campaigned in Ohio on Saturday in support of Democrats U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown and gubernatorial candidate Richard Cordray.

“We’re in a battle for America’s soul,” Biden, his voice faint and scratchy, told a crowd at a high school south of Cleveland. “We Democrats have to make it clear who we are. We choose hope over fear, we choose unity over division, we choose our allies over our enemies and we choose truth over lies.”

Congressional candidates campaigned in a whirlwind close across the country: in Virginia, Democrat Jennifer Wexton greeted voters in the Manassas Veterans Day parade; in New Jersey Republican Jay Webber met them in a diner, and in Minnesota Republican Pete Stauber went door to door urging people to vote.

EARLY VOTING UP SHARPLY

As of Friday night, almost 32.4 million people had cast ballots early, according to The Election Project at the University of Florida, which tracks turnout. That is up more than 50 percent from the 20.5 million early votes cast in all of 2014, the last federal election when the White House was not at stake.

Trump on Friday appeared in West Virginia with Patrick Morrisey, who is seeking to unseat Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. They marked his third campaign appearance in West Virginia and fourth in Montana.

Some analysts said the president’s repeated visits to states that he won in 2016 were a signal Republicans were worried about keeping control of Congress.

“It’s not a good sign for Republicans if they have to spend all these resources for a seat they shouldn’t have to be fighting for,” said Simon Haeder, a professor of political science at West Virginia University, in a phone interview. “That should be a solid Republican seat.”

In Florida, Trump is due to campaign for Governor Rick Scott, who is trying to unseat Democratic U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, and U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis, who is running for governor against Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum.

Trump was due to campaign with Senate candidates in Montana and Florida, on the fourth day of an 11-rally tour largely focused on states he carried in 2016, where Republican challengers are trying to unseat Democratic incumbents.

“Heading to Montana and Florida today! Everyone is excited about the Jobs Numbers - 250,000 new jobs in October. Also, wages rising. Wow!” Trump said on Twitter early Saturday.

The Labor Department on Friday reported sharply better-than-expected job creation in October, with the unemployment rate steady at a 49-year low of 3.7 percent and wages notching their best annual gain in almost a decade.

The appearance was intended to boost the campaign of Matt Rosendale, the Republican state auditor challenging Democratic U.S. Senator Jon Tester. Trump called out Tester for his vote against his most recent Supreme Court nominee, saying “what he did was terrible.”

Republicans in many competitive suburban districts have tried to focus their campaign messages on the robust economic growth, though in his campaign appearances Trump has also focused on his hard-line immigration stance as he looks to stem the illegal and legal flow of people into the United States.

“We’re in a battle for America’s soul,” Biden, his voice faint and scratchy, told a crowd at a high school south of Cleveland. “We Democrats have to make it clear who we are. We choose hope over fear, we choose unity over division, we choose our allies over our enemies and we choose truth over lies.”

Congressional candidates campaigned in a whirlwind close across the country: in Virginia, Democrat Jennifer Wexton greeted voters in the Manassas Veterans Day parade; in New Jersey Republican Jay Webber met them in a diner, and in Minnesota Republican Pete Stauber went door to door urging people to vote.

EARLY VOTING UP SHARPLY

As of Friday night, almost 32.4 million people had cast ballots early, according to The Election Project at the University of Florida, which tracks turnout. That is up more than 50 percent from the 20.5 million early votes cast in all of 2014, the last federal election when the White House was not at stake.

Trump on Friday appeared in West Virginia with Patrick Morrisey, who is seeking to unseat Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. They marked his third campaign appearance in West Virginia and fourth in Montana.

Some analysts said the president’s repeated visits to states that he won in 2016 were a signal Republicans were worried about keeping control of Congress.

“It’s not a good sign for Republicans if they have to spend all these resources for a seat they shouldn’t have to be fighting for,” said Simon Haeder, a professor of political science at West Virginia University, in a phone interview. “That should be a solid Republican seat.”

In Florida, Trump is due to campaign for Governor Rick Scott, who is trying to unseat Democratic U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, and U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis, who is running for governor against Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum.

"Getty Images President Donald Trump voiced optimism about making a deal on trade with China. He’s seen here with Chinese President Xi Jinping in April 2017.

President Donald Trump hailed better-than-expected jobs numbers on Friday, as he sounded a note of optimism on trade with China and touted the pending return of U.S. sanctions on Iran.

‘INCREDIBLE NUMBERS’

Trump tweeted “Wow!” after the government reported 250,000 new jobs were generated in October, keeping the unemployment rate at a 48-year low. Wages were up 3.1% over the past year, prompting the president to comment, “These are incredible numbers. Keep it going, Vote Republican!”

Opinion: Trump should be crowing about jobs, so why is he obsessed with immigration?

The president also said he was optimistic the U.S. and China would make a trade deal, which led the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.43% to cut its intraday losses. He spoke after White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow refuted a report that Trump had asked for a draft of a U.S.-China trade accord.

“We’re getting much closer to doing something” on China and trade, Trump told reporters. “A lot of progress has been made.”

IRAN SANCTIONS RE-IMPOSED

Trump tweeted a dramatic image of himself that recalled the HBO series “Game of Thrones,” to promote the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions against Iran that had been lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal.

The sanctions will take effect Monday, as Trump alluded to in the tweet. It read simply, “Sanctions are coming. November 5.” The sanctions cover Iran’s shipping, financial and energy sectors. Administration officials said waivers will be granted to eight countries to allow them to temporarily continue importing Iranian oil without U.S. sanctions. The countries weren’t named but analysts have said China, India and Turkey are most likely to be given extra time to find alternative supplies.

"Getty Images Florida Republican Rick Scott, who’s in a tight Senate race with Democrat Bill Nelson, is among those brawling over health care this midterm election season.

President Donald Trump has dominated every political conversation since he took the White House but one: the midterm elections.

With some Republicans reluctant to be seen with him and Democrats shying away from impeachment talk, issues like preexisting medical conditions are animating the pitches of congressional candidates and their supporters more than the controversial president himself.

“During the heat of the 2018 midterms, issues are taking center stage and Trump references are much more rare,” said a recent report by the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks political advertising and is housed at Wesleyan University.

Mentions of Trump in congressional ads have fallen off since the summer; disapproving mentions outweigh positive ones over past month. References to immigration, Russia and Mueller remain low https://t.co/VW066LbDrZ @wesleyan_u pic.twitter.com/EOI13RrjOk — WesleyanMediaProject (@wesmediaproject) October 19, 2018

In advertising as well as mentions by candidates on their campaign web sites, health care is a standout issue of Campaign 2018. During the primaries, about 80% of House Democratic candidates took a stance on health care or Obamacare on their sites, according to a Brookings Institution report by Elaine Kamarck and Alexander Podkul. Health care was also the top issue for Democratic Senate candidates, with 68% of them featuring it.

See: Republicans alarmed that Obamacare attacks could cost them the House.

Health care also ranked in the top five issues mentioned by Republican candidates, but immigration was the top issue discussed by GOP Senate candidates and federal tax policy took the No. 1 spot for House hopefuls during the March-September primary season, according to the Brookings report.

Health care has featured prominently in West Virginia’s Senate race, among others, with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin airing an ad in which he shoots a copy of a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Obamacare. Manchin’s Republican opponent Patrick Morrisey, who is West Virginia’s attorney general and has joined the suit, says he supports protecting pre-existing conditions. The lawsuit would end such protections.

The $1.5 trillion tax cut Trump signed last year is a theme in campaigns — but not always in the way the GOP had hoped. Trump backers like Pennsylvania Rep. Lou Barletta tout the tax cut, along with the president’s deregulatory efforts. Yet as polling shows the law to be unpopular, Democrats have seized on it. One such example is an ad hitting Rep. Peter Roskam, an Illinois Republican who helped craft the legislation when he served as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee’s subcommittee on tax policy.

Read: ‘The 1% never had it so good’: What key midterm candidates are saying about the economy now.

“There’s no disputing Peter Roskam’s link to Donald Trump as the author of Trump’s tax plan that gave $1 trillion in tax breaks to big corporations and the top one percent, adding nearly $2 trillion to the deficit,” said an ad from Democrat Sean Casten. Roskam, reported Talking Points Memo, has argued his district is saving “a billion dollars a year” but hasn’t run his own ads on the tax law.

Republicans are using immigration to fire up voters as a caravan of Central American migrants has made its way toward the U.S. border. A recent ad by South Carolina Republican Katie Arrington labels her Democratic opponent “Open Borders Joe Cunningham,” and evokes the caravan.

Still, immigration can’t compare to health care when it comes to campaign advertising. Between Sept. 18 and Oct. 15, only about 8% of ads in federal races overall referenced immigration, according to the Wesleyan Media Project. Pro-Republican ads were more than twice as likely to discuss it than ads for Democrats. That includes ads by the candidates themselves as well as super PACs and party committees.

Also read: Trump Today: President says he’s preparing order to end birthright citizenship.

By contrast, in the same period, about 46% of airings in federal races mentioned health care. Both parties are discussing health care, but the topic is most prominent in ads supporting Democrats, appearing in 54.5% of pro-Democratic airings, the Wesleyan Media Project said.

With some Democrats supporting “Medicare for all,” Republicans have sharpened attacks against their opponents. A September tweet by Gov. Rick Scott, who’s running against Democrat Bill Nelson in a close Senate race in Florida, said “If you want a socialist experiment with Medicare, by all means vote Democrat.” Nelson told the Tampa Bay Times he doesn’t support Medicare for all, and that he’s got “enough trouble just trying to save Obamacare.”

If you want to protect Medicare, vote Republican. If you want a socialist experiment with Medicare, by all means vote Democrat. — Rick Scott (@ScottforFlorida) September 6, 2018

One more key issue that Republicans are running on this campaign season comes in the form of a person: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Trump, wrote the Cook Political Report’s Amy Walter last month, may want to make the midterms a referendum on “open borders,” but between Sept. 1 and Oct. 15, Republican candidates ran more anti-Pelosi ads and more health-care ads than immigration ads.

Walter wrote that Republicans aren’t trying to show their independence from Trump, but instead are “trying to win back their formerly committed GOP voters by stressing the loyalty their Democratic opponent shows to Pelosi.”

"As voters head to the polls in the 2018 midterm elections Tuesday, a string of East Coast races could be early indicators on which party will win the battle for control of the U.S. House, while the fight for the U.S. Senate runs through a slate of tossup states that are in later time zones. Here’s your guide to watching the results roll in on Election Day, based on East Coast times.

The first polls begin closing at 6 p.m. Eastern in Kentucky and Indiana.

Kentucky and Indiana: Indiana has some polls closing at 6 p.m. Eastern. But the key race to watch is in Kentucky: the state’s sixth congressional district in Lexington. The seat is currently held by Republican Rep. Andy Barr, who represents an area where the GOP typically does well, but he is facing a well-financed opponent in retired Marine pilot Amy McGrath, a Democrat.

7 p.m. Eastern

Polls start to close in four key states: Virginia, Georgia, Florida and also Indiana, where a last batch of polls close in a state that is in two time zones. Polls also close in South Carolina.

Florida: Democrat Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, has attracted a grassroots following of young people and minorities. The party hopes Mr. Gillum’s campaign for governor against the GOP’s Ron DeSantis can bring more Democrats to the polls, all the while lifting the fortunes of incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, who is being challenged for his Senate seat by outgoing Republican Gov. Rick Scott.

On the House side, the four most competitive races to watch are all prime pick opportunities for the Democrats: FL-26 and FL-27, two GOP-held districts that encompass part of the Miami-Dade region; FL-15 outside Tampa; and FL-16 in Sarasota County.

Indiana: Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, one of the party’s most vulnerable incumbents, is being challenged by businessman Mike Braun. Republicans are looking to capture this seat to expand their 51-49 Senate majority or to create a buffer to offset loses elsewhere.

Georgia: The governor’s race between progressive former state lawmaker Stacey Abrams and Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, a Republican, is one of the most watched in the country. She could make history by becoming the first black female governor in the U.S.

The WSJ`s Gerald F. Seib talks about the numbers that are important to determine control of the House and Senate. Photo: Getty

There are also two key House races to watch: Georgia’s sixth congressional district, home of a special election last year that launched this year’s fierce fight for control of the chamber, where Rep. Karen Handel is facing Democrat Lucy McBath. The race illustrates how both parties this year have battled over suburban, educated women. The other is Georgia’s seventh congressional district, where GOP Rep. Rob Woodall faces a tight race with Democratic challenger Carolyn Bourdeaux.

Virginia: There are several opportunities for House Democrats to pick up seats. Rep. Barbara Comstock, an incumbent in the Washington, D.C., suburbs, is considered among the most vulnerable Republicans as she squares off against Democrat Jennifer Wexton.

A more significant bellwether could be in Virginia’s second congressional district, where GOP Rep. Scott Taylor faces a stiff challenge from Democratic businesswoman Elaine Luria. And Republican Rep. Dave Brat, who ousted Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a 2014 primary, is now in danger of losing his seat to Democrat Abigail Spanberger.

7:30 p.m. Eastern

Polls start to close in three states: North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia.

Ohio: The governor’s race in Ohio is nationally watched because 2016 GOP presidential candidate John Kasich is leaving the governor’s mansion due to term limits. Republican Mike DeWine faces Democrat Richard Cordray in the race to follow Mr. Kasich.

A rematch in Ohio’s 12th congressional district in suburban Columbus could also be telling. Rep. Troy Balderson won a special election there this year—but just barely beating Democrat Danny O’Connor—signaling the GOP’s weakening grip in suburbia.

West Virginia: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin’s state voted for President Trump in 2016 by 42 percentage points. Yet, Mr. Manchin is leading attorney general Patrick Morrisey in public polling, and a victory would demonstrate that a candidate’s personal brand can outweigh party affiliation.

What to Watch: 8 p.m. to 9 p.m.

At 8 p.m. Eastern, the largest set of states will close, including eight states with competitive Senate races. Statewide competitive races 8 p.m.: Senate S TN MI PA MO MS TX ND IL CT NJ G Governor KS OK MD RI SD Other states closing: DE AL MA ME AR Competitive House races closing Democrat-held Republican-held Tossup Likely Democrat Lean Republican Likely Republican Lean Democrat

8 p.m. Eastern

Polls start to close in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.

Kansas: The governor’s race is a tossup between Republican Kris Kobach and Democrat Laura Kelly, and there are two potential House upsets. GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder’s seat in the third House district is at risk of falling into the Democratic column, as the race now leans in favor of challenger Sharice Davids. There is also a tossup race for an open seat in the state’s second congressional district, where Rep. Lynn Jenkins, a Republican, is retiring.

Michigan: GOP Rep. Mike Bishop, whose eighth district includes a swath of the Detroit suburbs, faces a tough challenger in Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA case officer, creating a key pick-up opportunity for Democrats.

Mississippi: There are two Senate races in the state, but one of them is unlikely to be decided Tuesday night. That’s because GOP Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith isn’t the only Republican vying for the seat: Republican Chris McDaniel is running against her, as is Democrat Mike Espy, creating a three-way race. The top two vote-getters advance to a Nov. 27 runoff if none of them can claim an outright majority of the vote on Election Day, under Mississippi election rules.

Missouri: Sen. Claire McCaskill is another endangered Democrat in the Senate. She faces state Attorney General Josh Hawley. President Trump made two trips to the state in the final days to try to knock off Ms. McCaskill.

New Jersey: Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, plagued by questions over his ethics despite escaping conviction in a corruption trial last year, is unpopular in a state that leans Democratic. He faces GOP businessman Bob Hugin. If Republicans can defeat Mr. Menendez, it would bode well for their ability to maintain control of the Senate.

Voters across the country will head to the polls Tuesday to cast their votes in the general election. The WSJ`s Gerald F. Seib explains five areas that are worth watching as results come in. Photo: Getty

Pennsylvania: There are four competitive U.S. House races in Pennsylvania, all of them pick-up opportunities for the Democrats, and they are looking here to make a strong down payment on their path toward a majority. Republicans have called this “ground zero” in the battle for House control. Several districts moved further out of reach for Republicans due to court-issued redistricting in the state.

Tennessee: The open Senate seat in Tennessee—Republican Sen. Bob Corker is retiring—is critical to Democrats if they have any hope of gaining ground in the chamber. Former Gov. Phil Bredesen, who was endorsed by singer Taylor Swift, is challenging Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who benefited from a Trump endorsement.

Texas: Can Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke topple GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in a deep-red state? It would be one of the biggest political upsets in the history of the Senate, and a signal that the Lone Star state could be in play during the 2020 presidential race.

Also in Texas, Democrats are targeting Republican Reps. Pete Sessions in a district outside Dallas and John Culberson of Houston, both in tossup races. A defeat of Rep. Will Hurd, who is facing Democrat Gina Ortiz-Jones, would signal a difficult night for Republicans.

What to Watch: 9 p.m. to 10 p.m.

At 9 p.m., polls start closing in Minnesota, which includes the only toss up and lean Republican seats held by Democrats. Statewide competitive races 9 p.m.: Senate S AZ MN CO WI G Governor Other states closing: NY NM NE WY LA Competitive House races closing Republican-held Democrat-held Lean Democrat Likely Republican Lean Republican Likely Democrat Tossup

9 p.m. Eastern

Officials start counting ballots in Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York and Wisconsin.

Arizona: An open Senate seat creates a rare opening for Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema to gain a seat for her party, but her fight against Rep. Martha McSally has been extremely tight. The seat is open because Sen. Jeff Flake, a Republican, is retiring.

Minnesota: Four races in Minnesota are a bellwether for control of the House. Both parties agree that if Democrats win in three of these four districts, it would be a bad sign for the GOP elsewhere in the country. The four races are:

MN-01: Democrats currently hold this seat in rural Minnesota. If they can hang on, it may mean they are faring better in rural areas than they often get credit for. Democrat Dan Feehan faces Republican Jim Hagedorn in that open-seat race.

MN-02: GOP Rep. Jason Lewis faces a stiff challenge from Democrat Angie Craig in outskirts of the Twin Cities.

MN-03: Republican Rep. Erik Paulsen faces Democrat Dean Phillips, presenting another test for the GOP in the suburbs.

MN-08: This is a seat the GOP is supposed to flip and create a small buffer against any other losses. Republican Pete Stauber is matched up with Democrat Joe Radinovich.

What to Watch: 10 p.m. and Later

The last 10 states start closing polls at 10 p.m. Eastern. Alaska runs the latest, keeping polls open until at least midnight on the East Coast. Statewide competitive races 10 p.m.: Senate S NV IA MT 11 p.m.: OR G Governor Midnight: AK Other states closing: HI CA UT WA ID Competitive House races closing Democrat-held Republican-held Lean Democrat Tossup Lean Republican Likely Republican Likely Democrat

10 p.m. Eastern

Polls start to close in Iowa, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota and Utah.

Nevada, Montana, North Dakota: These three states will likely determine control of the Senate. Democratic Sens. Jon Tester of Montana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota are hoping to win in states President Trump took in 2016. Mr. Tester’s race is a tossup against Republican Matt Rosendale; Ms. Heitkamp’s race is leaning in favor of her Republican opponent, Rep. Kevin Cramer.

In Nevada, Republican Sen. Dean Heller, the chamber’s most vulnerable GOP incumbent, battles Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen.

11 p.m. Eastern

Polls start to close in California, Oregon and Washington state. Oregon and Washington have all-mail voting, but ballots can be turned in as late as 8 p.m. local time; that’s 11 p.m. on the East Coast. The races to watch:

California: If the battle for the U.S. House isn’t determined by 11 p.m. when polls close in California, there are seven competitive seats here that could settle the outcome:

Newsletter Sign-up

CA-10 (tossup): GOP Rep. Jeff Denham faces Democrat Josh Harder.

CA-25 (tossup): GOP Rep. Steve Knight faces Democrat Katie Hill.

CA-39 (tossup): In a race for an open GOP seat, Republican Young Kim is being challenged by Democrat Gil Cisneros.

CA-45 (tossup): GOP Rep. Mimi Walters is up against Democrat Katie Porter.

CA-48 (tossup): GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher faces Democratic businessman Harley Rouda.

CA-49 (leaning Democratic): Democratic lawyer Mike Levin is leading Republican Diane Harkey in polls.

CA-50 (leaning Republican): GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter faces Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar.

Oregon: Oregon may elect a GOP governor for the first time in 36 years. Republican Knute Buehler is campaigning for voters unhappy with Democratic Gov. Kate Brown—and President Trump. Mr. Buehler said he wrote in Ohio’s moderate Republican Gov. Kasich in the 2016 presidential election rather than back Mr. Trump.

Washington: The state’s southwestern corner has seen an influx of nearly $2 million in new spending from both parties, indicating that the seat held for four terms by GOP Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler is in jeopardy. Her opponent is Democrat Carolyn Long.

12 a.m. Eastern

Polls close in Alaska.

Alaska Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, suspended his re-election bid less than three weeks before the election. The move came three days after the sudden resignation of Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott over what Mr. Walker described as an inappropriate overture toward a woman. The three-way governor’s race is leaning in favor of Republican candidate Mike Dunleavy over Democrat Mark Begich but after such a recent scandal, the outcome is hard to call.

Amplification:

Indiana has some polls closing at 6 p.m. Eastern. But a last batch of polls close at 7 p.m. Eastern in Indiana because the state is in two time zones.

On January 11, 2019, Patrick Morrisey, the Attorney General of the State of West Virginia, issued a legal opinion discussing the legal risks the financial service industry may face as West Virginia implements its medical cannabis law. Marijuana, or cannabis, is classified as a Schedule I drug under the federal Controlled Substance Act.

Marijuana is still illegal under federal law. As such, federal law creates obstacles for federally regulated financial institutions. If a bank chooses not to report marijuana-related activity, it could face federal criminal charges, civil liability, and its officers could be held personally liable.

Given these complications, the Attorney General has explained the viability of several potential responses to safeguard banks from these regulations. These responses include creating one or more of the following: (i) a “Seed-to-Sale” system, wherein the State would enact its own safety regulations regarding marijuana to minimize exposure that banks face; (ii) a “Closed-Loop” system, which circumvents traditional banking methods by conducting all financial transactions involved in a state-legalized marijuana industry through a separate, state-managed portal; (iii) a state-run bank, in attempts to avoid the federal regulations altogether; and finally (iv) a “Cannabis Credit Co-op,” which would operate similar to a credit union.

Despite the lack of guidance from state and federal authorities, the medical marijuana industry is flourishing in the United States. It presents an opportunity for creative, thoughtful entrepreneurs to develop compliant payment systems that preserve the integrity of West Virginia’s medical marijuana program and minimize the potential risk of federal criminal and civil liability for financial institutions and others participating in the program.", Status of Medical Marijuana in West Virginia ,1-2019
"West Virginia`s only Roman Catholic diocese has released the names of two more priests who it says have been credibly accused of child sexual abuse in the state.

The priests are accused of committing the abuse while working at the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston. Both are deceased.

One of them, the Rev. Raymond Waldruff, previously was accused of abuse in the Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in the 1960s. Complaints of decades-old abuse were made against him in March in the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston and in April in the Diocese of Owensboro, Kentucky.

Waldruff served at two churches in north-central West Virginia in the 1970s.

The other priest, the Rev. Andrew F. Lukas, was accusing of abusing a minor in the 1960s. The allegation was reported to the diocese in January.

Eight other priests added to the latest list had claims against them in other regions or dioceses but not in West Virginia. None are in active ministry.

The Intelligencer and Wheeling News-Register first reported on the updated list, which brings to 40 the number of accused priests or deacons who served in West Virginia.

The diocese posted the list on its website last week. The original list was posted in November.

Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston spokesman Tim Bishop said in a statement Tuesday that the updated list shows ""the Diocese`s commitment to transparency and accountability.""

West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey filed a lawsuit in March accusing the diocese and former Bishop Michael Bransfield of knowingly employing pedophiles and failing to conduct adequate background checks on camp and school workers.

Morrisey said in a statement that the diocese quietly updated the original listing without immediately trumpeting its release.

""If the Diocese truly sought closure and healing for victims, it would make good on its obligation to announce updates to its findings so those victimized would feel empowered to seek counseling and know they are not alone,"" Morrisey said.

Instead, ""the Diocese appears fixated upon its goal of minimizing this scandal with limited publicity about wrongdoing and maximum publicity of its public relations campaign to protect the Church.""", W.Va. Catholic diocese releases more accused priests` names ,5-2019

"Many American families – busy getting into their autumn routines of juggling work, school and extra-curricular activities – are just now beginning to focus on who to vote for in the midterm elections Tuesday.

The central question people have to consider is this: Are you better off today than you were two years ago?

A lot has happened in the two years since the American people voted to make Donald Trump our president.

President Trump, the ultimate political outsider, has cemented his reputation as a leader who makes promises and keeps promises.

Despite unprecedented obstruction by Democrats, President Trump and Republicans in Congress have spent the past two years working to enact the president’s America First agenda.

First and foremost, the president`s historic tax cut and deregulation program have kicked our economy into overdrive. Millions of jobs have been created. Unemployment is at its lowest level since 1969.

Yet Democrats voted in unison to oppose the Trump policies that led to all this good economic news.

The Senate has confirmed Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to serve as justices on the Supreme Court – yet another enormous accomplishment for the president. The two justices will be staunch defenders of the Constitution, safeguarding our liberties on our nation’s highest court for decades to come.

North Korea is no longer testing missiles and nuclear bombs, thanks to the president`s foreign policy of peace through strength.

And President Trump has moved our embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, something that many presidents promised, but never did.

Despite complete Democratic resistance on health-care reform and tough border security measures, the president has managed to get the awful individual mandate scrapped and border wall construction underway.

Because of this outstanding record, here we are less than a week before the midterm elections and Republicans are squarely in the game.

In Senate elections, seats once considered likely to go to Democrats are looking better for Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., and Rep. Martha McSally, R-Ariz.

In Nevada, eye-grabbing headlines like ""Unemployment rates drop across Nevada last month,"" appear to be causing people to move toward re-electing Heller and making Republican Adam Laxalt the next governor.

Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, the Democratic Senate candidate in Arizona, has been exposed as a left-wing radical.

If Republicans manage to hold onto the seats in Arizona and Nevada, they could be looking at picking up three or four seats in the Senate.

Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer looks like a safe bet to defeat Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota.

Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley is running strong against Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in Missouri.

In Indiana, the latest polling shows that Republican businessman Mike Braun is running ahead of Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly by a margin of 46 to 43 percent.

Similarly, conservative Republican Senate candidates Patrick Morrisey in West Virginia, Matt Rosendale in Montana and Gov.Rick Scott in Florida are all in the hunt in their races in states that President Trump carried.

While the outlook in the U.S. House is far more uncertain, a consensus is emerging among those closing tracking the races that a blue wave may not be coming after all.

This decline in optimism among Democrats may be due to reality setting in among American voters. Men and women across our country are concerned about the liberal agenda of tax hikes, open borders, blowing up Medicare, and trying to impeach any conservative in high office who they don’t like.

What the Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearing in the Senate and the pending caravan invasion of Central American migrants make clear is that the left is inviting chaos to America. Hardworking American taxpayers are wary of it.

The massive mob of migrants currently working their way through Mexico hell-bent on entering America illegally confirms that serious border security laws must be passed by Congress without delay.

These caravans will become the rule – not the exception – if Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., becomes speaker of the House again.

I wouldn’t be surprised if the majority in the House of Representatives is decided by five to 10 seats either way. House races where strong Republican women are running – like Barbara Comstock in Virginia, Claudia Tenney in New York, Maria Salazar in Florida, Lena Epstein in Michigan, Wendy Rogers in Arizona and Young Kim in California – could decide who controls the House in 2019.

A Media Research Center report found that 92 percent of the mainstream media`s news coverage of President Trump has been negative. When you consider the onslaught of fake news that this president has had to endure for the past two years, the fact that the House is still in play for Republicans a week before the election is an accomplishment in itself.

When it comes to voting for your representative in Congress, the American people need to consider the past two years.

It`s clear that President Trump`s foreign and domestic policies have paved the way for more security and prosperity for all Americans. We can`t afford to go back.

A vote for a Pelosi majority in Congress is a vote for crippling gridlock in government and a continuation of the partisan and divisive investigations into the 2016 election. I hope that gives Americans pause.

A vote to keep the levers of government out of the hands of the leftwing mob is a vote for more economic prosperity, common sense border security and a chance to finally move past the 2016 election and start to heal – and unit – as one nation with shared hopes and dreams for a better future.", Trump successes are boosting GOP candidates in midterms – Don’t expect a blue wave ,11-2018
"Sen. Joe Manchin scored re-election to the Senate in West Virginia on Tuesday, defeating his Republican challenger and keeping a Democratic hold in a state President Trump won by a landslide in 2016.

Manchin defeated West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in a race watched closely by political observers. Trump won the state by more than 42 percentage points two years ago.

FULL MIDTERM RESULTS

Manchin was the only Democrat to break from his party in voting to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court -- after it was apparent Kavanaugh would be confirmed.

Manchin won 51 percent of the vote compared to Morrisey`s 45 percent, with 39 percent of precincts reporting when the race was called. Manchin, a conservative Democrat, ran ads during the campaign that sought to highlight his independence and support for the Second Amendment.

"Democrats will take control of the House of Representatives for the first time in eight years, Fox News projects, and the GOP will retain its majority in the Senate, following Texas Republican incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz`s defeat of insurgent challenger Rep. Beto O’Rourke in the most expensive Senate race in American history.

While Democrats` win in the House deals a major setback to President Trump’s legislative agenda and gives fresh hope to liberals who want to investigate and perhaps even impeach the president, the GOP`s hold on the Senate gives them control over all critical federal judicial appointments.

Although the exact size of the parties` respective majorities in the House and Senate are not clear, Democrats will soon have to decide whether to restore Nancy Pelosi to her old job as speaker of the House, which she held from 2007 to 2011.

""I do think that when you’re in the arena and somebody throws a punch, you better able to take a punch and throw a punch,"" Pelosi said this week, previewing the adversarial approach she would bring to the speakership.

Pelosi and top Democrats have vowed to open a series of investigations into the White House upon reclaiming the House, including probes into Trump`s unreleased personal tax returns, alleged collusion with Russia, and potential ethics violations by administration officials.

Prominent firebrands including Democratic Reps. Maxine Waters, Adam Schiff, and Jerry Nadler are slated to be elevated to lead the House Financial Services Committee, Intelligence Committee, and Judiciary Committee, respectively. With control of those and other key committees, Democrats will have the legal authority to issue subpoenas to compel Republicans and others to provide documents or appear at hearings -- and to seek contempt proceedings if they don`t comply.

""We will be able to get answers the Republicans were unwilling to pursue,"" Schiff told CNN in October. ""Records that the Republicans wouldn`t ask for."" (Pelosi has said that trying to obtain Trump`s tax returns would be ""one of the first things we`d do."")

Schiff added that he would place a ""very high priority"" on determining whether the Trump Organization had laundered money through Russia.

""You better able to take a punch and throw a punch."" — House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

Republicans, meanwhile, defied expectations of a blue wave on the strength of several major wins in the Senate. The Fox News Decision Desk projects that Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer will unseat one-term Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota, scoring a crucial Senate pickup for the GOP. Heitkamp, who had long struggled against Cramer in the reliably red state, may have sealed her political fate last month when she voted against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

In Indiana, Republican businessman Mike Braun will defeat first-term Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, another Democrat whose vote against Kavanaugh proved costly. The race was one of the most closely fought races in the country, and Braun`s victory marks another big win for the GOP. Trump had aggressively campaigned for Braun in recent days.

FULL MIDTERM RESULTS

New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez will win re-election by defeating Republican businessman Bob Hugin, Fox News also projects. In another key race, the Fox News Decision Desk projects that Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn will defeat former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen to replace retiring GOP Sen. Bob Corker.

While Blackburn spent all summer trailing Bredesen in the polls, she closed the gap and took the lead about a month ago, despite a last-minute endorsement by pop star Taylor Swift for Bredesen. Menendez, meanwhile, never trailed Hugin despite being seen as potentially vulnerable due to his 2017 federal corruption trial.

The Fox News Decision Desk also projects that West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin will win re-election by defeating Republican Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Manchin was the only member of his party to vote to confirm Kavanaugh.

Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney will also defeat Democrat Jenny Wilson to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch, as expected. The former Massachusetts governor, previously a fierce Trump critic, secured his support after backing his presidency.

And the Fox News Decision Desk can now project that none of the four candidates in Mississippi`s special Senate election will win tonight because none garnered 50 percent of the vote. The top two finishers – Republican incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democratic challenger Mike Espy -- will face each other in a runoff election on Nov. 27.

A number of other key races remain too close to call, including the contest between Montana incumbent Sen. Jon Tester and Republican challenger Matt Rosendale, the state auditor. President Trump has made it his mission to defeat Tester, who helped torpedo Trump’s nomination of White House physician Ronny Jackson to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. At this moment, Tester has a lead in this race.

In Nevada, Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen has a slight lead over incumbent Republican Sen. Dean Heller, but it’s too early to declare a winner in that race.

The Fox News Decision Desk also cannot yet project a winner in Arizona, where Republican Rep. Martha McSally is in a tight battle with Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake.

Democrats were able to regain the majority in the House by flipping key seats; they needed to take 23 for a majority. In Northern Virginia`s 10th Congressional District, GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock is projected to lose to her Democratic challenger, state Sen. Jennifer Wexton. Comstock was widely seen as one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress.

And 77-year-old Democrat Donna Shalala, who served as Secretary of Health and Human Services under President Bill Clinton, has defeated Republican opponent Maria Elvira Salazar in Florida`s 27th Congressional District, which has long been held by the GOP.

But two major Democratic efforts to flip Republican-controlled seats have come up short. In Kentucky`s 6th Congressional District, Republican incumbent Rep. Andy Barr has defeated Democrat Amy McGrath. The two had been competing in a neck-and-neck race, which Democrats saw as an opportunity to flip a seat in a GOP-leaning district. McGrath, the first female Marine to fly an F/A-18 on a combat mission, campaigned on a largely anti-Trump platform.

And Republican Denver Riggleman has defeated Democrat Leslie Cockburn to keep a closely watched Virginia congressional seat in the hands of the GOP. Virginia`s 5th Congressional District is home to incumbent GOP Rep. Tom Garrett, who announced that he would not seek re-election earlier this year amid mounting scandals. While the district supported President Trump in 2016 by double-digits, the contest had been tight between Cockburn, a former journalist who favors Medicare-for-all, and Riggleman, a staunch Republican.

Still, although voters in more than half of the 50 states have now locked in their ballots, the results of some of the most closely watched and consequential Senate and House contests in the midterms are still undetermined as Democrats look for signs of the blue wave they have predicted in recent days.

The Missouri contest between Democratic incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill and Republican challenger Josh Hawley, the state’s attorney general, is among those too close to project a winner, according to the Fox News Decision Desk. McCaskill said on Monday she doesn`t ""really care"" if Democrats retake the Senate, in an apparent effort to appeal to moderate voters in a state Trump carried by double digits in 2016.

Meanwhile, the Fox News Decision Desk projects that Democratic Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine will win a second term tonight by beating Republican challenger Corey Stewart. And Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who identifies as a democratic socialist, will easily win a third term by defeating Republican Lawrence Zupan.

And Democratic Sen.Elizabeth Warren will win a second term in Massachusetts, although she is already considering a presidential run in 2020. Warren defeated Republican Geoff Diehl, a state lawmaker. In another expected result, the Fox News Decision Desk can project that incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown will win a third term by defeating Republican Rep. Jim Renacci.

""Everything we have achieved is at stake,"" Trump, who announced that he will watch the election returns at the White House with family and friends, declared on Monday. Trump has openly characterized the first nationwide election since his rise to the presidency as a referendum on his tenure, which has seen significant economic growth and a rise in partisanship.

Democrat and former CIA officer Abigail Spanberger also is challenging Tea Party-affiliated Republican Rep. Dave Brat, who has represented the state`s 7th Congressional District since 2014, when he stunned the nation by unseating then-House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor. Trump also carried this district by 7 points in 2016, and it has had a Republican representative for almost 50 years. But changing demographics have put it in play, analysts say.

On the gubernatorial side, Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum could make history as Florida`s first black governor if he defeats Republican Ron DeSantis to replace Scott, who is term-limited. Gillum supports Medicare-for-all and abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, and he has the backing of liberal megadonors like billionaire Tom Steyer in his bid to shift the state dramatically to the left. His agenda contrasts sharply with DeSantis, a hard-line Republican who cut an advertisement in which he teaches his child to ""build the wall"" with toy blocks.

The race is currently too close to call.

And in Georgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams could also make history as the country`s first black female governor. She is facing off against Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, whose hard-line voter registration policies have drawn rebukes from civil-rights groups and a federal judge, and Libertarian Party nominee Ted Metz. Kemp announced that his office was investigating ""possible cyber crimes"" by the Georgia Democratic Party on Sunday, throwing a last-minute wildcard into the race. It is too early to call that race.

Depending on Tuesday`s vote totals, Georgia may not have a governor-elect for several more weeks. Under Georgia law, if no single gubernatorial candidate gains at least 50 percent of the vote, a Dec. 4 runoff will be scheduled.

"Until Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., makes up his mind about Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, Republican challenger Patrick Morrisey is hammering the incumbent for being undecided.

That’s even though Morrisey thinks Manchin supports Kavanaugh, too.

“He will vote for Kavanaugh,” Morrisey said. “But he’s going to wait for the votes to come in.”

Morrisey, West Virginia’s attorney general, has said he believes Manchin is trying to avoid being the deciding vote for or against Kavanaugh. Other senators apparently on the fence have included Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska.

“This is all about politics for him,” Morrisey said, “because he’s waiting until Collins and Murkowski and others declare. Once that happens, he’ll jump on board.”

President Trump won West Virginia by 42 points in 2016, and Manchin supported the president`s first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch.

However, Trump argued at a rally in Wheeling on Saturday that Manchin isn’t a reliable partner very often- so he’s moved on.

“A vote for Morrisey is a vote for me,” Trump said.

Still, Manchin credited Kavanaugh for his rebuttal of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.

“They’re both credible witnesses and they both believe deeply and sincerely of what they testified to,” Manchin said.

So does the vulnerable Democrat, one of 10 trying to win re-election in a state President Trump carried, just need to see the results of a week-long FBI investigation into Kavanaugh’s background before he can pledge his support?

Not necessarily.

“It might not come to any different conclusion,” Manchin said. “But basically what we can say is: we’ve crossed all the Ts and dotted all the Is, and all the boxes have been checked.”", Joe Manchin mulls Kavanaugh vote while facing tough West Virginia re-election challenge ,10-2018
"Several swing-vote senators are facing torrential political backlash for their stances on incoming Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, as protesters and well-heeled political advocacy groups vow that Saturday`s historic confirmation won`t soon be forgotten.

On Saturday, President Trump predicted that Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, ""will never recover"" from her last-minute decision to become the only Senate Republican to oppose Kavanaugh.

“I think the people from Alaska will never forgive her for what she did,"" he told The Washington Post.

Murkowski announced her decision on Kavanaugh Friday after weeks of speculation, saying that despite being a ""good man,"" Kavanaugh was ""not the right man for the court"" at the current moment.

But her vote was seen in conservative circles as a fundamental betrayal and a repudiation of basic principles of due process. Trump has made getting results on federal judicial nominees a key plank of his administration, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has led a successful push to install new conservative appellate and district court nominees at a record-breaking pace this year, with several more to be appointed in the coming weeks.

“I think the people from Alaska will never forgive her for what she did."" — President Trump

In response to Murkowski`s vote, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin wrote on Twitter, ""I can see 2022 from my house,"" in a tongue-in-cheek reference to ""Saturday Night Live"" actress Tina Fey`s impersonation of her during the 2008 presidential election. The offhand remark set off a firestorm on social media, as some Republicans saw the possibility of a political comeback for Palin.

And Fox News host Laura Ingraham weighed in, writing, ""I like Alaska...a lot. Maybe it’s time to run for Senate after all. ... Murkowski has abandoned all principles of due process and fairness. Disgraceful.""

Ingraham added that Murkowski`s speech ""sounded like it was written by a Women`s Studies` major at Wellesley [College],"" a private women`s school, and criticized its ""abysmal delivery"" and ""pedestrian writing.""

But there were several indications Murkowski would be relatively secure by the time she comes up for re-election in 2022. The longtime senator survived an upstart tea party primary challenge in 2010, and won by double-digits in her 2016 race.

Significantly more vulnerable is North Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who voted against Kavanaugh after staying undecided for months. Fox News` polling shows Republican challenger Kevin Cramer now leading by 12 points (53-41 percent). Last month, before the Kavanaugh confirmation focused primarily on how to weigh the lurid and uncorroborated sexual misconduct allegations againts the nominee, Cramer was up by only 4 points (48-44 percent).

KAVANAUGH SLUGFEST MAY BOOST REPUBLICANS IN SENATE RACES, FOX NEWS POLLING SHOWS

Manchin, a red-state Democrat who didn`t announce his support for Kavanaugh until after Maine Republcian Sen. Susan Collins` support already assured his confirmation, faced bitter, potentially career-ending backlash of his own from Republicans.

Manchin was the first Democrat to agree to meet with Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill, and he has repeatedly said that he wanted to carefully analyze the FBI`s supplemental background check on Kavanaugh before casting his vote.

""A real profile in courage from Lyin’ liberal @JoeManchinWV,"" Donald Trump Jr. wrote on Twitter Friday. ""Waited until Kavanugh had enough votes secured before he announced his support. I bet he had another press release ready to go if Collins went the other way.""

He concluded with a call for West Virginians to elect Manchin`s challenger, Republican Patrick Morrisey, in November: ""Vote for #MAGA champion @MorriseyWV!""

Manchin faced even more hostile attacks from far-left progressives, who shouted and jeered at him as he walked through the Capitol complex under heavy security on Friday.

WATCH: PROTESTER CONFRONTS MANCHIN: `HOW ARE YOU NOT LISTENING TO SURVIVORS?`

Protesters also chanted ""shame"" at Manchin and drowned him out as he attempted to explain his vote in a televised interview.

In a dramatic address from the Senate floor Friday afternoon, Collins effectively provided political cover for Manchin`s vote as she outlined for nearly an hour her reasons for supporting Kavanaugh, after carefully vetting his legal opinions, as well as the FBI supplemental background check into uncorroborated sexual misconduct allegations against him. The Maine Republican Party said the address was the ""gold standard of speeches in explaining her vote and showing how a nominee should be evaluated.""

In her speech, Collins decried the intense partisanship of the confirmation battle, and specifically noted that ""interest groups have also spent an unprecedented amount of dark money opposing this nomination."" Trump on Saturday called Collins an ""honorable, incredible woman.""

Within hours, one crowdfunding website, Crowdpac, said that it had crashed from the influx of donations intended to help Collins` eventual challenger. By Saturday afternoon, more than $3.2 millon had been raised for ""her opponent`s campaign, once that opponent has been identified."" According to fundraising data from OpenSecrets.org, that number nearly matches the total amount raised this year by Maine`s junior senator, Angus King, in his reelection bid.

Collins` announcement not only assured Kavanaugh`s elevation to the Supreme Court, but also touched off an almost immediate uproar on Capitol Hill and across social media -- as well as among several well-heeled special interest groups.

Susan Rice, the former national security adviser to President Barack Obama, responded ""me"" on Friday to a post asking who could challenge Collins when she is up for re-election in 2020. She also retweeted a post slamming Collins` speech as a ""paean to disingenuousness and incoherence.""

Rice later clarified that she was ""not making any announcements,"" but she said Collins` decision made her ""deeply disappointed."" She also re-posted another user who pointed out that ""Rice`s mother`s family is from Maine and she has spent summers there."" Rice is from Washington, D.C. and went to college at Stanford.

Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, another swing vote key vote for Kavanaugh, was pelted with expletives from protesters after announcing preliminary support for the nominee last week. He is retiring this year.

In Indiana, Democratic incumbent Joe Donnelly, who voted against Kavanaugh, currently tops Republican challenger Mike Braun by two points (43-41 percent), according to the latest Fox News polling.

Braun has said he would have supported Kavanaugh if he were in the Senate -- a stance backed by the state`s other incumbent, Republican Sen. Todd Young.

Meanwhile, liberal advocacy group MoveOn announced it had canceled a six-figure advertising buy for Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen because of pro-Kavanaugh stance, even though Bredesen offers Democrats one of their best chances to win a Senate seat in November."," Swing-vote senators face major political blowback, and potential high-profile challengers, after casting pivotal Kavanaugh votes ",10-2018

The realities are that Democrats have a better chance at regaining control of the House than they do the Senate. They need to win 23 more seats to take over the House. The hope is that women - already frustrated with President Trump - turn out in droves for the midterms.

On the Senate side: The reality is there`s a Blue Wave in the House and there may even be a Red Wave in the Senate. It`s really misleading to look at the national numbers when you`re trying to look at that Senate map because the biggest battlegrounds are by and large taking place in some of the most conservative states in the country.

"West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin tried to secure a personal “Governor’s Helicopter” during his time as the state’s governor, using funding from a prescription drug settlement that was intended to combat illegal drug use.

A decade ago, the state of West Virginia was set to receive $44 million from the maker of OxyContin, Purdue Pharma, over its misleading claims concerning the addictiveness of the drug, just as the death from opioid addiction was skyrocketing in the state.

Manchin’s office publicly touted his role in deciding how to spend the settlement money, with Joe Thornton, the governor’s cabinet secretary for military affairs and public safety, saying “we may be wanting to think out of the box a little bit” on how to use the funds.

The “out of the box” attitude led to Manchin requesting $3 million for the helicopter, according to documents obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.

“Governor wants settlement funding dedicated to purchase a new helicopter,” an August 2007 memo circulated by Carte Goodwin, Manchin`s chief counsel, read. The proposal was reportedly marked as “Governor’s Helicopter.”

PRESIDENT TRUMP APOLOGIZES TO BRETT KAVANAUGH AND HIS FAMILY AT CEREMONIAL SWEARING-IN AS SUPREME COURT JUSTICE

“This request needs not only to determine the ability to fund, but under what circumstances would a helicopter be allowed under the stipulations of the settlement. Call me if you have questions or this doesn`t make sense. $3 million,” the memo states.

Manchin’s request for a helicopter was deemed a “RED FLAG” after a review by Norbert Federspiel, the director of the Division of Criminal Justice Services, according to the outlet. “First off it cannot be the Governor`s Helicopter,” a note reportedly reads.

Federspiel criticized the idea of a personal helicopter for the governor and wasn’t sure the $3 million cost could be justified.

“If it is used predominantly by State Police for law enforcement activities, it is probably justifiable,” he said. “Assurances and documentation of usage for law enforcement purposes would be a must. I don`t know what percentage of use the Governor could make of such a thing, but at very least I`m sure that [West Virginia State Police] WVSP would need to us [sic] it the majority of time in order to fly.’

“State police would have to document their need for the bird,” he added. “Beware of public perception and awareness.”

Manchin apparently accepted the advice and no purchase of the helicopter using the funds from the settlement was made.

The Democratic senator is currently facing a tough battle to keep his seat in a deep-red state suffering from the highest rates of opioid-related deaths.

A new Republican poll claims Manchin is leading his Republican opponent Attorney General Patrick Morrisey by only 1-point.

"With less than a month until the midterm elections, Republicans are now going on the offensive in several Senate races as part of a reinvigorated effort not only to hold onto their slim majority in the upper chamber but to expand it significantly.

Meanwhile, analysts are warning that Democrats, who extensively focused in recent months on longshot bids to derail Republican candidates in reliably red states, may have neglected critical Midwest battleground states in a manner reminiscent of the 2016 presidential election.

Three pivotal Senate races have shifted in the GOP`s favor in Fox News` latest Power Rankings, with Texas and North Dakota now considered likely Republican wins, and Tennessee changing from a toss-up to the lean-Republican column.

In Texas, a new Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday shows Democratic Rep. Beto O`Rourke trailing incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz by 9 points. ""Senator Cruz would have to suffer a major collapse for him to lose"" his Senate seat, said Peter Brown, the poll`s assistant director.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: PUMP UP THE VOLUME AS MIDTERMS APPROACH

Those results mirror a Quinnipiac poll from several weeks ago, suggesting that O`Rourke`s momentum has flatlined.

""Sen. Cruz would have to suffer a major collapse for him to lose."" — Quinnipiac University poll director Peter Brown

And in another high-profile race, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., has surged to a double-digit lead over challenger Phil Bredesen, according to an in-progress New York Times poll. A CBS News poll last week showed Blackburn leading Bredesen by 8 points.

Bredesen last week secured the endorsement of music superstar Taylor Swift, who said Blackburn`s voting records ""appalls and terrifies"" her. Bredesen broke with his fellow Democrats and voiced support for then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as a series of uncorroborated sexual misconduct allegations were leveled against him.

Several campaign volunteers abandoned Bredesen after he announced his position on Kavanaugh, Politico reported Wednesday.

“As a woman voter in Tennessee, I felt torpedoed by the statement,” one organizer in Memphis, Rhonda McDowell, told the outlet.

Retiring Republican Sen. Bob Corker, who holds the seat Bredesen and Blackburn are seeking, last week told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., that Democrats` scorched-earth tactics on Kavanaugh had badly damaged Bredesen, who needs conservative support to prevail in Tennessee.

Analysts say that Democrats` faltering bids to retake two seats in traditionally red states has parallels to the 2016 presidential race, when breathless news reports suggested Hillary Clinton had a chance at winning Texas.

""Liberal activists and online media [are] touting Democratic chances and paying more attention to stretch cases like Texas and Tennessee, when the Democrats need to protect vulnerable incumbents in states like Missouri and Indiana,"" Michigan State University political science professor Matt Grossman told Fox News.

GOP ENTHUSIASM SURGES AMID KAVANAUGH SLUGFEST, BOOSTING REPUBLICANS ACROSS THE BOARD

""That reminded me of talks about possible Democratic wins in Arizona, Georiga, and Texas in 2016, when Clinton had to protect the Midwest states,"" he added.

Fox News ranks the Senate races in Indiana and Missouri as toss-ups, as vulnerable incumbent Democratic Sens. Joe Donnelly and Claire McCaskill, respectively, try to fend off challengers in states President Trump won by double-digits in 2016. Both voted against Kavanaugh, which has become a central issue in both contests.

The Kavanaugh effect appears to have had the biggest effect on another vulnerable incumbent Democrat, North Dakota`s Heidi Heitkamp. She trails Republican challenger Kevin Cramer by 12 points. Last month, before Heitkamp voiced her reluctance to support Kavanaugh, he was up by only 4 points.

HEITKAMP SLAMS HILLARY FOR `RIDICULOUS` CLAIM THAT CIVILITY IS IMPOSSIBLE WITH GOP

“That spectacle proved to be perhaps the greatest political gift I’ve been given in a very long time,” Cramer said.

""The most recent polling suggests it’s going to be a tale of two elections."" — Republican strategist Bruce Mehlman

And a new poll in another red state, West Virginia, shows incumbent Democrat Joe Manchin leading Attorney General Patrick Morrisey by just one point. But the poll, which was commissioned by national Republicans and the Morrisey campaign, is an outlier.

Manchin`s last-minute support for Kavanaugh, who is highly popular in West Virginia, has become a key issue in the campaign, with Morrisey calling Manchin`s vote a ""craven political calculation.""

Speaking exclusively to Fox News Wednesday night, President Trump said Republican candidates are moving to take advantage of the encouraging numbers.

“The fact is I think we are doing really well,” Trump said. “Many of the Senate races that we didn’t think we were going to be contesting, we are now leading. We have some great candidates. And, very importantly, we are finding the same thing now with the House.”

Grossman, who also directs Michigan State`s Institute for Public Policy and Social Research, cited an additional challenge for moderate senators like Heitkamp and Manchin who often buck their party: Congressional races are increasingly becoming nationalized. He cited a variety of factors to explain that trend, including greater interest in national media sources, President Trump`s larger-than-life profile, and more cohesive top-down party messaging.

While indicators are strong for Republicans in the Senate, the map is also working in the GOP`s favor. There are nine Senate seats currently held by Democrats in states that went for Trump in 2016 but just one Republican incumbent running in a state carried by Clinton.

That state, Nevada, is home to a tight race that Fox News currently considers a toss-up, as incumbent Sen. Dean Heller faces off against Jacky Rosen. And a state that Trump carried in 2016, Arizona, is also considered a toss-up, as Democrat Kyrsten Sinema has polled narrowly ahead of Republican Martha McSally to replace outgoing Republican Sen. Jeff Flake.

Meanwhile, in the House, where all seats are up for grabs, signs are less favorable for the GOP. A new poll from Quinnipiac University showed that 49 percent of voters preferred that the Democrats take back Congress, compared with 42 percent for Republicans.

“The most recent polling suggests it’s going to be a tale of two elections, with center-left voters powering Democratic gains in the House and center-right voters expanding Republicans’ Senate majority,"" Republican strategist Bruce Mehlman told Fox News.

ANALYSIS: WHAT TO EXPECT AS MIDTERM CHAOS CONTINUES

Mehlman pointed to other signs of a possible impending ""blue wave"" in the House. For example, Trump`s approval rating is roughly consistent with that of other presidents` in recent decades when their party saw major losses in Congress. Presidents with higher approval ratings tend to see their party retain more seats.

Still, there were some signs of resurgence this week for Republicans in the House, as well. Florida’s highly competitive 27th Congressional District, which Clinton won by a 20-point margin over Trump in 2016, had been considered one of the easiest seats in the country for Democrats to pick up just months ago.

But the race to replace retiring Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen is now only a ""Lean Democrat"" race according to Fox News` latest Midterm Power Rankings. Donna Shalala, the Democratic candidate, is facing a spirited challenge from her lesser-known GOP opponent, Spanish-language journalist and political rookie, Maria Elvira Salazar.

“This will be the marker for, if and possibly when, the Democrats might pick up the House for the 2018 elections,” said Florida International University political science professor Kathryn DePalo. “If Democrats pick this up, then I think it’ll be a good night for Democrats in Florida and perhaps around the country.”

In a statement to Fox News, a spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee was bullish on the district: ""In a district that Clinton won by 20 points, this is shaping up to be a devastating loss for Democrats.”

"West Virginia Attorney Gen. Patrick Morrisey is hoping to topple an incumbent Democrat who has held his Senate seat for nearly a decade.

Morrisey is locked in a tight campaign against Sen. Joe Manchin, who was first appointed to the seat in 2010. He pulled off an upset in the Republican primary earlier this year, beating out coal baron Don Blankenship and Rep. Evan Jenkins to secure the GOP nomination in May.

Although the race leans Democrat, according to Fox News’ rankings, it’s one Republicans hope to take over in the midterm elections.

President Trump, who endorsed Morrisey in the primary, has set his sights on helping Morrisey in November. He headlined a rally for Morrisey in the Mountaineer State in August.

“I have done so much for West Virginia, against all odds, and having Patrick, a real fighter, by my side, would make things so much easier,” Trump also said in a tweet.

Morrisey is the first Republican to serve as attorney general in West Virginia since 1933, his campaign website boasts. First elected to serve in the position in 2012, he was re-elected in 2016.

In his campaign, Morrisey, 50, has harped on his efforts as attorney general to curtail the state’s opioid epidemic. He sued the Drug Enforcement Administration, saying it allows companies to not take into account patients’ needs when selling drugs. And his office has reached settlements with pharmaceutical distributors for about $47 million, the largest in the state’s history, according to his campaign website.

His past work as a health care attorney and his wife’s work as a lobbyist who has represented several pharmaceutical clients, including those involved in opioids, have come under scrutiny during the race.

His wife’s lobbying firm was also paid $460,000 by Planned Parenthood, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported last year. Morrisey has said he is staunchly anti-abortion and opposes taxpayer dollars going to Planned Parenthood. He has also said he supports a repeal of Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court abortion case.

In an interview with Fox News, Morrisey said he`s already worked with Trump to get rid of some Obama administration regulations and to ""go after"" sanctuary cities in West Virginia. He said he has an ""excellent"" relationship with the president.

"A Roman Catholic archdiocese in West Virginia announced Wednesday it plans to release the names of all priests and deacons who have been ""credibly accused"" of child sexual abuse since 1950.

None of the individuals who will be listed are in active ministry, Archbishop William Lori of the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston said in a news release.

No timetable was given on when the list would be released. Lori said the list will include the accused priests` assignments in the diocese, whose records only go back to 1950.

""The trust of the people has been badly damaged,"" Lori said. ""Disclosing the names of all those credibly accused of abuse is a critical step toward repairing that broken trust. I pray this will lead toward healing and demonstrate the Diocese`s firm commitment to transparency and accountability.""

Last month Pope Francis accepted the resignation of West Virginia Bishop Michael Bransfield and authorized an investigation into allegations he sexually harassed adults.

Bransfield had been investigated for an alleged groping incident in 2007 and was implicated in court testimony in 2012 in an infamous Philadelphia priestly sex abuse case. He strongly denied ever abusing anyone and the diocese said it had disproved the claims. He continued with his ministry until he offered to retire, as required, when he turned 75 in September.

Lori, Bransfield`s temporary replacement, set up a hotline for potential victims to call, said the Vatican had instructed him to make the investigation public, and had vowed to conduct a thorough study into what he said were ""troubling"" claims against Bransfield, who was a major fundraiser for the Vatican through the Pennsylvania-based Papal Foundation.

The West Virginia diocese`s delegate of administrative affairs, Bryan Minor, will oversee the process of reviewing files in preparation for the disclosure of the names of the accused. The list will be ""as comprehensive as possible"" and will be released after it has been reviewed and confirmed by a diocese review board, Minor said in the statement.

Minor said the diocese will continue to support victims after the records are released.

Zach Hiner, executive director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, said the group was pleased the diocese plans to release the names, ""but the fact remains that if the lists are to carry any weight, they should be determined by independent investigators, not by church staff or church affiliated review boards.

""Trained law enforcement professionals should be in charge of investigating who knew what, when they knew it, and what a credible accusation of abuse looks like.""

Curtis Johnson, a spokesman for West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, on Wednesday referred to a statement Morrisey issued the day of Bransfield`s resignation. That statement said Morrisey`s office will be ""closely reviewing this matter to determine how best we can protect West Virginians who might have been victims in this scandal. We have reached out to the Diocese and expect they will be fully cooperative in efforts to get to the bottom of these matters.""

Earlier this month the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., released the names of more than two dozen clergy members it says have been ""credibly accused"" of sexually abusing minors. Diocese officials in Texas this month announced plans to release a similar list early next year.

Lori also is the archbishop for the Baltimore archdiocese. On Monday, he announced Maryland`s attorney general is delving into records of the Baltimore archdiocese as part of an investigation into child sex abuse.

"President Trump is once again stumping for GOP congressional candidates and touting his MAGA successes, this time at a Saturday night rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.

“America is winning again, and America is respected again,” Trump said. “We are putting America first, finally.”

He called his win in 2016 “a revolution,” thanks to “the people.”

This latest Trump rally helped mobilize support for GOP candidates including U.S. Senate nominee Patrick Morrisey, the state’s attorney general. Morrisey is challenging the Democratic incumbent, Joe Manchin, who’s facing a tough reelection battle in a state Trump won by 42 percentage points in 2016.

Trump again criticized Manchin for supporting Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trump’s rival in the 2016 presidential race, as well as for joining all Senate Democrats in voting against substantial tax cuts that Trump signed into law last year.

“Bad things will happen if you sit home,” he said, urging his supporters to get out and vote, and raising the specter of a Democratic Party in control of the levers of government.

Trump accused liberals of ruthless and outrageous tactics to get their way.

Trump said Democrats are the party of crime and open borders, and wish to nudge their politics into socialistic territory so that America might wind up Venezuela, where violence and conflict have sent more than two million people fleeing, and made Venezuela’s inflation and homicide rates among the highest in the world.

The Democratic Party is so far left, “Pocahontas is considered a conservative,” Trump said about Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Trump repeatedly has referred to Warren as “Pocahontas,” mocking her claims of a Native American heritage.

“We see this horrible, horrible, radical group of Democrats. You see what’s happening right now,” Trump said at the rally before thousands of supporters.

“And they’re determined to take back power by any means necessary. You see the meanness, the nastiness. They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power.”

Case in point, the president said: the ongoing Washington tussle over his nominee for a Supreme Court vacancy, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, whose confirmation has been complicated by a welter of sexual misconduct accusations.

Trump praised his pick, and condemned Democrats for what he called their shameless, disgraceful conduct toward Kavanaugh, who he called “one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time.”

“Thursday, the American people saw the brilliant and really incredible character, quality and courage of our nominee for the United States Supreme Court, Judge Brett Kavanaugh,” Trump said, referencing the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing attended by the judge and one of his accusers, a California professor named Christine Blasey Ford.

Reading off his fact sheet, Trump applauded West Virginians who are 58 percent in favor of Kavanaugh on the nation’s highest court; he noted 28 percent are opposed.

Trump mocked the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, California’s Sen. Dianne Feinstein, as unconvincingly denying that she leaked the letter in which Ford told her story.

Feinstein has insisted Democrats on the committee weren’t the source of the leak.

Trump last visited West Virginia a month ago for a rally in Charleston, as Pittsburgh`s KDKA-TV reported.

The president has maintained popularity in West Virginia, and has visited several times since taking office.

At the same time, he has ratcheted up efforts to help Republicans keep control of the Senate with recent stops in Nevada and Missouri.

Morrisey was also endorsed by Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas.

"President Trump announced late Monday that he would head to West Virginia to campaign on behalf of the “hardworking and spectacular” Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who is hoping to flip the seat from Democratic challenger and incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin in the upcoming midterm elections.

Morrisey, who won the Republican primary, hopes to give the GOP a much-needed win in one of the top Senate battlegrounds as Democrats set the stage for a tough battle in November to regain control of the House.

“Will be going to the Great State of West Virginia on Tuesday Night to campaign & do a Rally Speech for a hard working and spectacular person, A.G. Patrick Morrisey, who is running for the U.S. Senate,” Trump tweeted. “Patrick has great Energy & Stamina-I need his VOTE to MAGA. Total Endorsement!""

Trump also reaffirmed his support of California’s GOP candidate for governor John Cox late Monday evening, who he says “will Make California Great Again.”

“I am hearing so many great things about the Republican Party’s California Gubernatorial Candidate, John Cox. He is a very successful businessman who is tired of high Taxes & Crime,” Trump tweeted.

Cox, who vowed to make the Golden State “livable and affordable” during an interview with Fox Business in June, will face Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the former San Francisco mayor, in the November general election.

Trump predicted earlier this month that Republicans could ride a “giant Red Wave” into the November midterm elections spurred on by none other than the president himself.

“As long as I campaign and/or support Senate and House candidates (within reason), they will win! I LOVE the people, & they certainly seem to like the job I’m doing,” Trump tweeted. “If I find the time, in between China, Iran, the Economy and much more, which I must, we will have a giant Red Wave!”

Trump-backed Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach won the Republican primary for the state’s gubernatorial race, and candidates in three Missouri and Michigan races also won.

Republican state Sen. Troy Balderson, who also had the endorsement of the president, declared victory in Ohio`s special election for a vacant House seat despite the race still being too close to call.

Democrats are widely seen as the favorites to reclaim control of the House, and are consistently leading in so-called “generic” congressional ballot polls – including districts that were once seen as solid red.

Despite coming up short in most of those races, Democratic leaders point out that the fact the races are competitive is a sign of Republican vulnerability in the fall.

"President Trump exhorted West Virginia voters to back Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey in November`s midterm elections Tuesday night, but avoided any mention of the legal troubles of his former campaign chairman and former personal attorney.

Trump addressed the campaign-style rally in Charleston hours after Paul Manafort was found guilty of eight financial crimes and Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to eight felony counts -- including two counts of violating federal campaign finance law.

The president briefly alluded to Special Counsel Robert Mueller`s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election when he addressed what he described as ""fake news and the Russian witch hunt.""

""Where is the collusion?"" Trump asked rhetorically. ""You know, they`re still looking for collusion. Where is the collusion? Find some collusion.""

But much of the rally followed a familiar pattern of Trump rattling off a list of accomplishments and urging voters to keep the Senate in GOP hands this November.

""We need to elect five, six, or even seven more senators and I think we can get it and we have to start with Patrick Morrisey,"" Trump said at a campaign-style rally in Charleston.

Morrisey, West Virginia`s attorney general, is challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin after a hard-fought primary victory over U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins and former coal company CEO Don Blankenship.

""We love you, Mr. President,"" Morrisey told Trump as he took the stage for a five-minute interval to excoriate the man he called ""dishonest, liberal Joe Manchin.""

""Joe Manchin no longer has West Virginia values, period,"" said Morrisey, whom Trump echoed when he re-took the lectern.

""I like Joe, but Joe doesn`t vote for us,"" Trump stated matter-of-factly. ""[A Manchin vote is] a vote for Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, their new leader, Maxine Waters ... They`re not in favor of West Virginia. They don`t know that West Virginia exists.""

Trump did flog a few of his favorite targets during the 75-minute rally. He attacked the NFL and ESPN over the issue of player protests during the playing of ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" He also offered a brief comment on the kidnapping and murder of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts, allegedly by a man living in the U.S. illegally.

""You heard about today with the illegal alien coming in, very sadly, from Mexico and you saw what happened to that incredible, beautiful young woman?"" Trump asked. ""Should have never happened. Illegally in our country.""

Earlier, Trump described the Manafort verdict as ""a disgrace"" as he landed in West Virginia, adding that ""it doesn`t involve me"" and ""has nothing to do with Russian collusion.""

"Candidates expressing strong support for President Trump continued their winning streak in Republican primaries Tuesday, capturing nominations in Florida, Arizona and Oklahoma. The victories confirm the strong approval ratings the president gets from Republicans across the nation.

In Florida, Republican voters nominated U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis to be their candidate for governor. DeSantis, a three-term congressman from the Jacksonville area, won a decisive victory over state Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam.

DeSantis was the underdog in the race until President Trump enthusiastically endorsed his candidacy and became a vigorous supporter. The president’s backing propelled DeSantis, who earned a Bronze Star in the Navy, to an impressive 57 percent to 37 percent victory over Putnam.

DeSantis has earned a reputation as an innovative conservative reformer in Congress and is well-positioned to take on Andrew Gillum, the far-left Tallahassee mayor and Democratic nominee who is backed by democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

Also in Florida, two-term Republican Gov. Rick Scott – another strong supporter of President Trump – easily won the GOP primary to become the party’s U.S. Senate candidate against Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. Scott currently leads Nelson by a margin of 46 percent to 44 percent, according to an average of recent polls.

Nelson, who has enormous name identification as the incumbent, is in a precarious position with such low support in the polls. Growing numbers of voters are seeing him for what he is – an out-of-touch career politician who has held elected office for most of the past 46 years.

Gov. Scott has pledged to help enact President Trump’s “America First” agenda if voters send him to the Senate. This represents a stark contrast to Nelson, who has essentially become little more than an obstructionist, following the lead of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

The run-off election in Oklahoma provided clarity for the fall elections in the Sooner State. Republicans chose political newcomer and businessman Kevin Stitt over former longtime Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett as their candidate for governor.

GOP voters also selected first-time conservative candidate and Trump supporter Matt Pinnell as their candidate for lieutenant governor over state Corporation Commission Chair Dana Murphy. Republicans have a considerable advantage in conservative Oklahoma, a state President Trump carried by a whopping 36 points in 2016.

In Arizona, two-term U.S. Rep. Martha McSally won a primary battle convincingly over former state Sen. Kelli Ward and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. McSally, a decorated retired Air Force colonel, will now square off against liberal Democratic U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema.

In the general election campaign, Sinema will have to explain to Arizona voters why she sided with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California in opposing President Trump’s historic tax cut. The tax cut has paved the way for robust economic growth, millions of new jobs and extraordinarily low unemployment rates – including the lowest Hispanic unemployment numbers ever recorded.

Also in Arizona, Gov. Doug Ducey secured a resounding primary victory after a welcome endorsement push from President Trump.

Senate Races Around the Country

Following Tuesday’s primaries, the stage is finally set in all the critical races around the country that will decide control of the U.S. Senate in the midterm elections.

In West Virginia, Trump-backed state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey will take on two-faced Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. Manchin talks up the Trump agenda on one end of Pennsylvania Avenue and then votes against it when he’s with his pal Chuck Schumer on Capitol Hill.

Morrisey will make the case that the Hillary Clinton-supporting Manchin clearly no longer represents the interests of West Virginia, a state whose citizens adore President Trump and rewarded him accordingly with an astonishing 42-point margin of victory in 2016.

Republican Trump-backed candidates are faring extremely well across the country in states the president won in 2016.

In North Dakota, a state President Trump carried by 36 points, polling indicates that Republican challenger U.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer is running ahead of incumbent Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp.

Similarly in Montana, where Trump cruised to a 21-point victory in 2016, Republican state Insurance Commissioner Matt Rosendale is leading liberal Democratic Sen. Jon Tester according to a recent poll.

Another hotly contested Senate race in the Midwest is in Missouri, where polls indicate conservative Republican state Attorney General Josh Hawley is running neck and neck with Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, another liberal career politician. President Trump is planning another trip to Missouri next month, a state he carried by 19 points in 2016.

And finally, in Indiana conservative outsider Mike Braun is running a very strong race to take the seat of Sen. Joe Donnelly, the incumbent Democrat. President Trump will be returning to Indiana this week – another state he carried by a commanding 19 points in 2016.

It’s clear that the Democrats in the Senate facing re-election in Trump Country are going to have plenty of sleepless nights between now and Election Day.

Will voters choose the Trump-powered Republican agenda of low taxes and less red tape, economic growth, border security and a strong military?

Or will voters choose the Schumer-Pelosi Democratic agenda of tax hikes, open borders and a meritless partisan impeachment witch hunt that will only be a waste of time and money?

The event, on the eve of Independence Day, was a prelude to the rebranded PGA golf tournament ""A Military Tribute at the Greenbrier"" -- and Trump made sure to mention a few of the golf pros in attendance.

“I like Phil, and Phil I think likes me,” Trump said, referring to golf legend Phil Mickelson.

The president also heaped praise on ""Big Jim"" Justice, the governor of the deep-red state who switched parties to become a Republican last year, as well as West Virginia Senate hopeful Patrick Morrisey.

POWER RANKINGS: NOT SO PEACHY PRIMARIES

Political primaries are like peach picking. You can shake the tree a little and you can grasp with a firm hand, but if you squeeze too hard the fruit will be rotten before it can ever get ripe.

We’re more than halfway through the primary calendar and both parties have, for the most part, avoided the kind of unforced errors that looked possible at the beginning of this election year.

But not in every case…

With this many bushels of peaches picked by the parties, it’s time again for us to look at our Fox News Power Rankings for the Senate [you can see the original rankings here and read about our system here] and sort out some bruised fruit.

Arizona Republican politics is rough stuff, so we always knew that the race to replace retiring Sen. Jeff Flake was bound to get pretty ugly, and hoo-boy were we right.

Parties can have bad primaries in a couple of different general ways. Sometimes, base voters just make a mistake and choose a candidate who can’t compete in a general election. Sometimes these choices to damage in other races, sometimes even beyond state lines. Virginia Republicans’ choice of Corey Stewart to oppose Sen. Tim Kaine, for example, is a straight forward example of this tendency.

More common, though, is the kind of bad primary in which the election itself damages the party’s chances. Either candidates are pushed to take extreme positions or the general foulness of the fight does damage to the survivor that lingers on in the fall.

Democrats are living through this right now in their Nevada gubernatorial race where a particularly bitter and personal primary fight puts nominee Steve Sisolak at an unnecessary disadvantage in his match up with state Attorney General Adam Laxalt.

But in their Senate race, Arizona Republicans may end up with the worst of both worlds: A fringy nominee who is further damaged by an ugly and acrimonious nominating process.

Democrats are seemingly quite content with their presumptive nominee, Kyrsten Sinema. She’s taking full advantage of being essentially unopposed in the Grand Canyon State’s Aug. 28 primary, dishing out sharp elbows to the Democratic leadership and staking out her brand as an independent-minded centrist.

Meanwhile, Republicans are melting down. The frontrunner, Rep. Martha McSally still looks like the GOP’s best bet for holding on to the seat. Her track record as a moderate and her military service made McSally a good pick for the GOP in her district, which covers the eastern suburbs of Tucson all the way to the New Mexico border. Republican horse pickers in Washington believe that those same characteristics would serve her well in a Senate run, but as the race has progressed, McSally has struggled to find a tone that works.

Her chief rival for the nomination is a former state senator who got lots of attention for her ill-fated primary challenge to Sen. John McCain in 2016. Kelli Ward was already running against Flake before the senator announced his retirement and just shifted her line of attack against the Washington elite from Flake to McSally. Ward, an absolute hardliner on immigration and a favorite of the Bannonite populist right, is Team MAGA all the way.

Further complicating the race is that former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio is also running, kind of… At 86 and in possession of a preemptive pardon from President Trump for Arpaio’s refusal to comply with court orders relating to his tenure as sheriff, hasn’t been much of a retail politician. But his famous name and attachment to causes dear to populist Republicans’ hearts – particularly his insistence that the 44th president is a secret Kenyan – give Arpaio electoral clout.

There’s not a ton of polling on the primary, but what there is shows Arpaio consistently trailing both McSally and Ward with McSally in the lead. This has created a problem for Ward who has been stuck fighting her fellow MAGAite for right-wing votes instead of focusing on roughing up McSally.

But it has been McSally who has been struggling the most to reinvent herself as a born-again Trump Republican, particularly on the issue of immigration, which is sure to be the dominate issue in the fall. McSally still has the lead, but with six weeks until the election there’s going to be a lot of rough road ahead.

Given the Democrats’ primary layup and the growing possibility the Republicans will nominate either a damaged or unsuitable candidate, we are moving this race from “Toss Up” to “Lean Democrat.”

It’s just the opposite for Republicans in North Dakota, however.

Incumbent Sen. Heidi Heitkamp barely squeaked by in 2012 to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad, who had been in office for 20 years. Given North Dakota’s reddening hue, the freshman was automatically at the top of Republicans’ target lists for 2018.

Heitkamp has tried to play the angles with Trump in many of the same ways her fellow red-state Democrats have, and to some success. But ultimately, what she needed this year was a weak Republican opponent like some of the other vulnerable Democrats have drawn. Heitkamp did not get so lucky.

Rep. Kevin Cramer has been in Washington as long as Heitkamp and, like her, is elected statewide in the sparsely populated Peace Garden State. He’s won by stout margins three times, including a 45-point romp in 2016. Cramer looks like he’s cruising now and we have reason to believe that Democrats are unlikely to invest too deeply on behalf of an incumbent facing such long odds in a state Trump won by nearly 40 points.

That’s why we’re moving North Dakota from “Toss Up” to “Lean Republican.”

Not all incumbents are created equal, though. Joe Manchin has been winning statewide elections in West Virginia since 2004 and his family traces its political roots to the 1960s. Republicans always knew that he would be tough to beat.

The West Virginia GOP’s dogfight of a primary didn’t help much either. Scathing, personal attacks certainly did their damage to state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who was portrayed as an ethically challenged carpetbagger by his rivals, Rep. Evan Jenkins and businessman Don Blankenship. Those are the kinds of claims that hurt the most in primaries since they transfer so easily to the general election.

Morrisey delivered a commanding win in June and certainly has time to change the race, but is so far running at a distinct disadvantage. Further complicating things for Morrisey is that his party is badly in disarray in Charleston. Many state Republicans are calling for the impeachment of Republican Gov. Jim Justice, who refuses to work from the capital, preferring to run state business from the Greenbrier Resort which he owns. When you are trying to knock off a well-entrenched incumbent, it’s generally not good to have your party tearing itself apart. When it’s happening while you are the state’s top lawyer, it’s particularly unhelpful.

Two months on from the Republican primary, the race looks increasingly like Manchin’s to lose. So we’re sliding West Virginia’s Senate contest from “Toss Up” to “Lean Democrat.”

THE RULEBOOK: IT PAYS TO BE INDEPENDENT

“In the general course of human nature, A POWER OVER A MAN`s SUBSISTENCE AMOUNTS TO A POWER OVER HIS WILL. And we can never hope to see realized in practice, the complete separation of the judicial from the legislative power, in any system which leaves the former dependent for pecuniary resources on the occasional grants of the latter.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 79

TIME OUT: HOMER COOKING

Paris Review: “The Iliad, attributed to Homer (seventh or eighth century B.C., possibly), tells of a dispute during the Trojan War between Agamemnon, the commander of the Greek forces, and Achilles, his star warrior. … Simone Weil, in a famous essay titled ‘The Iliad or the Poem of Force,’ wrote that violence is the poem’s central character, but that ‘Justice and love … bathe the work in their light without ever becoming noticeable themselves, except as a kind of accent.’ The destruction, in other words, only underlines the importance of what is being lost. …In that spirit, it becomes a wonderful book to cook from, and turns out to be full of scenes of communality where the Greek troops mark events of social and religious significance with feasting and drinking wine. Homer even includes quite a bit of technical detail on what cuts of meat they’re using and how they’re preparing them.”

TRUMP SAID TO BE FOCUSED ON KAVANAUGH, HARDIMAN

NYT: “President Trump has decided on his nominee to the Supreme Court after spending Monday morning working the phones primarily seeking input about two judges who were said to be the finalists, Brett M. Kavanaugh and Thomas M. Hardiman, people familiar with the discussions said. … Mr. Trump had been going back and forth between Judge Kavanaugh, the favorite of the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, and Judge Hardiman, whom the president’s sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, a former colleague of Judge Hardiman’s, has pressed him to choose. Two other candidates for the seat of the retiring Justice Anthony M. Kennedy — Judge Amy Coney Barrett and Judge Raymond Kethledge — were not the focus of Mr. Trump’s morning discussions, according to those familiar with the discussions. The drama-focused president is going to announce his choice for the Kennedy seat in a Monday night address to the country at 9 p.m.”

Conservative group hitting airwaves to pressure red state Dems - Fox News: “A conservative group planned Monday to launch a high-dollar ad campaign in support of President Trump’s Supreme Court pick, as both sides gird for a costly and confrontational battle before the nominee is even announced. Judicial Crisis Network is launching a $1.4 million ad buy on national cable and digital, with a particular focus on four states: Alabama, Indiana, North Dakota and West Virginia. The ad is expected to feature an introductory bio on the president’s yet-to-be-named Supreme Court nominee. The campaign is set to launch ‘as soon as the nominee is announced,’ according to Judicial Crisis Network.”

Meet the four finalists - WSJ: “As the clock ticks on President Donald Trump’s choice for a Supreme Court vacancy, each of the four people under close consideration could move the court in a more conservative direction for decades. ‘Republicans are holding four lottery tickets, and all of them are winners,’ Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) said Sunday in a Fox News interview. Here’s a look at the top contenders…”

Williamson: Court packing would be destructive - National Review: “The current push on the Left to expand the no-quarter approach to Supreme Court politics by introducing court-packing schemes is genuinely dangerous for the country. That’s worth thinking about, but it is also worth considering — not that I’ll shed any tears over it — that it’s dangerous to the political aspirations of the Democratic party, too. Republicans have bested them in all their own favorite games, gerrymandering, filibusters, and weaponizing congressional procedure prominent among them. They’d probably be better at court-packing, too. The Republicans may look divided and in disarray in the Trump era — and they are, of course — but it is the Democrats who have the more pressing long-term coalitional problem of being a party in which little old white liberal ladies lord over a growing and politically dynamic constituency that is much younger, much browner…”

Klein: court packing is an understandable response from liberals - Vox: “The Supreme Court is meant to be insulated from democracy. It’s not meant to be a partisan tool for undermining democracy. What’s emerging now is a dangerous loop, in which Republicans barely holding onto power manage to keep control of the Supreme Court by any means necessary, and in return, the Supreme Court’s Republican appointees issue rulings to help their party cling to political power. In the long term, that’s bad for the country’s unity and the Court’s legitimacy.”

“This primary felt like it was who had the biggest gun, who had the biggest truck, and who could be the craziest.” – Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, R-Ga., in a leaked recording released by his opponent in the GOP gubernatorial primary runoff, Secretary of State Brian Kemp’s campaign.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Chris, great commentary on the thirteen colonies and how people lived back then. So nice to see you describe how leaders of the colonies got together to solve problems of a new nation without much of a pattern to follow. Not always in agreement, but looking for ways to create a better life for all. It’s shameful how we operate today in a two party system in which corruption and selfishness abound. Keep up the good work. Would like to see more articles about how our ancestors helped each other to solve common problems.” – Howard Lewis, Canfield, Ohio



[Ed. note: Thank you for the kind words, Mr. Lewis. I like your idea. I also like the idea of talking about what’s happened in our history when we have FAILED to solve common problems. The agonies of the summer of 1968 or the spring of 1861 teaches a great deal about the consequences of failing to maintain a healthy republic.]



“Chris: Very insightful analysis on the Founding Fathers and their reliance on each other. I commend to your attention a terrific book from 1982 titled ‘The Transformation of Virginia 1740-1790’ by Rhys Isaac, who was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in History for this seminal work. It is about the ‘Great Awakening’ and how the Presbyterians, Methodists and Baptists sought to de-emphasize the role of the Established (Anglican) Church in Virginia; the roles played in that by Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson; the conflict over that issue between the Gentry from Tidewater and the planters/yeomen of the western counties; and how the Gentry (despite their long economic and religious connections to England) threw-in their lot with the planters/yeomen when it became clear to the Gentry that the furor over the continuation of the Establish Church was the precursor to a fight with England over independence of the colonies.” – Bill Canfield, McLean, Va.



[Ed. note: So true, Mr. Canfield! I will look at that book forthwith. It is easy to forget in our rapidly secularizing culture that many of the political fault lines we know today descend from those sectarian divisions that predate even our founding.]

WLUK: “It may be the dead of summer, but in one small area of Appleton [Wisconsin] signs of a long winter can still be seen. There`s still a snow pile inside Appleton`s Yellow Ramp. Despite a hot, steamy weekend last weekend, the snow is still staying strong. One man saw the rare sight, and decided to snap a photo and send it to the City of Appleton`s Twitter and a response didn`t take long. ‘Figured I`d share it with the City of Appleton since this is one of their parking ramps and figured there might be an opportunity to have some fun with it,’ said JP Heim. ‘Just knowing that, even in Wisconsin where we get a lot of snow and it can hang out, you know, a long time. I thought, man, people are going to get a kick out of this,’ said Chad Doran with the City of Appleton. Now, the area where the snow pile sits is the dumping spot for snow that collects on the roof. Doran said the snow pile is now like a tourist attraction.”

"Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh broke a political firewall Monday afternoon by meeting with West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin -- the first Democrat to sit down with President Trump`s pick for the high court.

The Manchin meeting could set the stage for other swing-vote Democrats to talk with Kavanaugh or even support him, despite fierce pressure from party leaders and activists.

Manchin said earlier this month that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. can ""kiss my you-know-what"" if he tries to pressure the West Virginia Democrat into opposing Kavanaugh. Manchin is facing a tough re-election battle in a state that went for Trump by double-digits in 2016.

In a statement to Fox News, Manchin`s Republican challenger, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, accused Manchin of making a ""craven political calculation"" by delaying his decision on Kavanaugh`s nomination until ""the outcome has already been decided.""

""Sen. Manchin needs to quit waffling and support President Trump`s Supreme Court nominee,"" Morrisey said. ""Clearly, Sen. Manchin is holding out his support for Judge Kavanaugh in order to assist liberal Chuck Schumer’s obstructionism.""

Manchin`s office released photographs of Kavanaugh talking and smiling with the senator late Monday.

The senator has said he`s interested in Kavanaugh`s views on the Affordable Care Act and its protections for people with pre-existing conditions. He has also asked his constituents to send him questions for the meeting.

I`M AN EDUCATOR. HERE`S WHY I WANT BRETT KAVANAUGH ON THE SUPREME COURT

After Manchin said he would talk with Kavanaugh, another red-state Democrat, Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., last week announced he also would meet with Kavanaugh. That sit-down is scheduled for Aug. 15.

Manchin was one of three Democrats who voted to confirm Trump`s first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. Donnelly and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota were the others. All three are up for re-election in states Trump easily won in 2016.

Manchin has said he regrets backing Hillary Clinton in 2016, and hinted that he could support President Trump’s re-election in 2020.

With the absence of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is fighting brain cancer, Republicans cannot afford to lose a single GOP vote to confirm Kavanaugh if all Democrats vote ""no."" Only a simple majority is needed to confirm Kavanaugh, after Republicans eliminated the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees last year. Democrats had previously eliminated the filibuster for other judicial nominees under the Obama administration.

There were new signs early Monday that Republicans were falling in line to support the nominee. Sen. Rand Paul announced after he met with Kavanaugh that he would support the nominee, despite earlier voicing reservations about Kavanaugh`s commitment to privacy rights.

The Kentucky senator was one of the few Republicans considered possible swing votes on Kavanaugh`s confirmation. Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who voted to confirm Gorsuch last year, also are being watched closely.

Both senators support abortion rights, and liberal advocacy groups have argued that Kavanaugh`s confirmation would undermine Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision.

But with Paul voicing clear support -- and Collins and Murkowski signaling potential support in recent weeks -- Kavanaugh`s prospects appear to be improving as GOP leaders aim to engineer a swift confirmation by the fall.

"Sen. Joe Manchin accidentally cracked fellow Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill’s rib while performing the Heimlich maneuver at a caucus luncheon, the Missouri senator revealed over the weekend – as she kept up her campaign schedule despite the colleague-inflicted injury.

A spokesman for West Virginia Sen. Manchin told The Washington Post that Missouri Sen. McCaskill began choking during a luncheon for Senate Democrats on Thursday.

Manchin intervened to save her.

But, according to the Post, McCaskill revealed to constituents over the weekend that Manchin injured her rib in the process.

No hard feelings, though.

“I’m really grateful to Joe – a little bit of a sore rib for a couple of weeks is no big deal,” McCaskill told the Post in a statement.

CLICK FOR SENATE RACE RATINGS

The senator has continued with votes and her campaign schedule – the only reported adjustment she’s making is to avoid hugging people for a while.

McCaskill and Manchin happen to be two of the most endangered Senate Democrats in this year’s midterm elections. Manchin is facing Republican state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in November, while the Missouri primary will sort out McCaskill’s challenger on Aug. 7 – the GOP front-runner is state Attorney General Josh Hawley.

Fox News’ Power Rankings consider both races a toss-up in November.

McCaskill addressed Democrats at the annual Truman Dinner in St. Louis on Saturday.

"Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said in an interview published Wednesday that he regrets backing Hillary Clinton in 2016, and hinted that he could back President Trump’s re-election in 2020 -- as he looks to fend off a Republican challenger in November.

In an interview with Politico, Manchin said that he urged the doomed Democrat in 2016 not to travel to the coal-rich state after she said she planned “to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.”



He said he considered pulling his endorsement, but that Clinton came to the state and promised that if elected, she would make sure devastated areas of West Virginia would receive highways, broadband Internet and a hydroelectic dam.



“It (endorsing her) was a mistake. It was a mistake politically,” he said, although he added that the offer of federal funding could not be refused. “Is this about me? Or trying to help a part of my state that’s never recovered and is having a tough time?”



Manchin also hinted that he could cross party lines in 2020 and back President Trump’s re-election.



“I’m open to supporting the person who I think is best for my country and my state,” Manchin said. “If his policies are best, I’ll be right there.”



Manchin faces a tough re-election race, and his West Virginia seat is eyed as a possible Republican gain in November. Trump won the state by more than 40 points, and Manchin has sought to draw himself close to Trump, as much as he can, as a way to fend off the challenge from the GOP.



He applauded Trump’s State of the Union address, and recently backed Gina Haspel, Trump`s choice for CIA Director.



“I’m with him sometimes more than other Republican senators are with him,” Manchin told Politico.



Yet he has also made a number of moves away from Trump, opposing his pushes for ObamaCare reform and tax reform. He also voted against Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.

A Democratic poll this month found that Manchin is leading Republican challenger and West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey by 12 points.

"In Tuesday night’s West Virginia Republican U.S. Senate primary debate, televised on Fox News Channel, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins underscored why they are the frontrunners and why they would do a far better job representing the state than Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin.

The GOP candidates face off in a primary May 8 to challenge Manchin, who has shown repeatedly that he is beholden to national Democrats and their far-left agenda of opposition to President Trump at every turn. Former coal executive Don Blankenship is also in the GOP primary, but trails in polls.

President Trump won a 40-point victory in West Virginia over Hillary Clinton in 2016. The Republican candidates made a point of saying they support the president and will help him improve the lives of West Virginians and Americans if they can oust Manchin and help the GOP expand its narrow 51-49 Senate majority in the November election.

Despite wishful thinking by Democrats that they will seize control of the Senate, a win in the West Virginia Senate race could be a sign that Republicans pick up three or four seats in the chamber.

Morrisey and Jenkins wisely stressed their support for President Trump in a state where he is clearly popular. In contrast, Manchin’s first loyalty goes to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat whose agenda is about as far from that of West Virginians as you can get.

As voters in my home state cast their ballots, here are three things to watch over the next week.

1. Who turns out to vote?

While unaffiliated voters can vote in the Republican primary in West Virginia, the race for the Senate nomination will be decided by which candidate wins self-identified conservatives and voters over age of 65. These are the two groups who historically turn out in West Virginia Republican primaries. In our recent GOPAC Election Fund poll, Attorney General Morrisey held the edge among conservative voters.

It is also important to look at the Eastern Panhandle of the state. There Berkeley, Jefferson and Morgan counties will have a huge impact on the final results.

In his previous two races for statewide office, Morrisey secured big enough margins in these counties to be victorious. However, the largest number of early votes cast in the primary for the Senate will come from the Charleston-Huntington Media Market. This could be a good sign for Jenkins, since Huntington includes his old state Senate district and the base of his congressional support.

2. Where do the late deciders go?

Both the GOPAC Election Fund and Fox News surveys found a significant number of undecided voters throughout the state. Whichever way they break will be decisive in determining which candidate wins the Republican Senate nomination. There will be plenty of commercials and communications from the candidates in the final week of the campaign and that could have a big impact.

3. Will a Democratic Super PAC, Duty and Country, determine the winner?

In the past two weeks, over $1.2 million has been spent in attack ads against Jenkins by Democratic outside groups. We are now seeing Democrats meddling in Republican primaries and attempting to influence who they will ultimately run against in the general election.

Should Jenkins be defined by these attack ads, this tactic will turn into Page One in the Democrats’ playbook with GOP primaries across the country.

With Manchin’s declining approval rating, Tuesday’s debate puts us one day closer to learning whether he will be a victim of the political environment that has turned against Democrats. West Virginia is a very pro-Trump state, and whoever wins the GOP primary is sure to wage a strong race against Manchin and hopefully send him into a well-deserved retirement"," In West Virginia, GOP Senate candidates in Fox News debate see support for president as key to victory ",5-2018
"West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Don Blankenship has attacked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell over his ""China family"" in the latest use of racially charged language by the former Massey Energy CEO.

In a campaign ad, which Politico reports will start airing on Friday, Blankenship says: ""Swamp captain Mitch McConnell has created millions of jobs for China people. By doing so, Mitch has gotten rich. In fact, his China family has given him tens of millions of dollars.""

McConnell is married to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who was born in Taiwan and whose parents are Chinese. Blankenship previously referred to McConnell`s father-in-law, shipping magnate James S.C. Chao, as a ""wealthy Chinaperson"" but has denied he meant it as a racial slur. He has also referred to McConnell as ""Cocaine Mitch,"" a reference to a 2014 magazine article alleging that drugs were found aboard a commercial cargo ship owned by the Chao family. The allegation did not directly involve McConnell.

FOX NEWS POLL: THREE TOP-TIER CANDIDATES IN WEST VIRGINIA SENATE PRIMARY

Former McConnell Chief of Staff Josh Holmes responded on Twitter: ""This clown is a walking, talking case study for the limitation of a prison`s ability to rehabilitate."" Blankenship served a year in federal prison for a misdemeanor conviction related to the 2010 explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine that killed 29 men in southern West Virginia.

Blankenship`s ad leaked on social media hours after President Trump`s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. called on West Virginia voters to ""reject"" Blankenship in the May 8 primary.

In a series of tweets, Trump Jr. said Blankenship was ""a train wreck who would guarantee another term for [Democratic incumbent] Joe Manchin.""

BLANKENSHIP AT FOX NEWS DEBATE: I SEE NOTHING OFFENSIVE ABOUT THE TERM `CHINAPERSON`

""No more fumbles like Alabama,"" said Trump Jr., referencing last year`s Senate special election won by Democrat Doug Jones. ""We need to win in November.""

A Fox News poll published April 24 showed Blankenship in third place behind Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney Patrick Morrisey.

National GOP forces are believed to be behind the Mountain Families PAC, an organization created in March that has invested more than $700,000 attacking Blankenship on television. A spokesman for the Senate GOP`s most powerful super PAC has declined to confirm or deny a connection to the group.

"Most candidates spend the weekend before an election making a last-minute appeal to voters.

Now, one candidate is making a last-minute appeal to his competitor’s probation officer.

In a press conference Sunday, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey laid out a plan to have the former coal baron Don Blankenship disqualified from Tuesday’s Republican Senate primary for failing to submit a financial disclosure, in violation of election law.

“My campaign will be informing his probation officer in Nevada about this issue right away, to determine if this refusal to comply with federal law violates the terms of his supervised release,” Morrisey said. “West Virginians don’t need a candidate who may not even be able to campaign in the state against Joe Manchin.”

Blankenship recently served a year in jail on a misdemeanor conviction for conspiring to violate mine safety laws, connected to an explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine in 2010 that killed 29 miners.

His probation is set to end Wednesday, the day after West Virginia’s primary.

According to the Blankenship campaign, the candidate has already spoken to his probation officer, who wasn’t concerned about the financial disclosure.

“Mr. Morrisey is just having a tantrum,” Greg Thomas, a Blankenship strategist and spokesman, told Fox News. “Everything will be OK in a few days.”

For weeks, Morrisey aimed most of his attacks at another primary opponent, GOP Rep. Evan Jenkins, but refocused his attention on Blankenship this weekend, with the press conference Sunday and a robo-call Saturday.

"Candidates in West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana and North Carolina made closing arguments this weekend ahead of key primaries Tuesday -- showing in many ways how Republican hopefuls are aligning behind President Trump while Democrats move to the left in more divided paths that threaten to undermine the party.

Ahead of West Virginia’s GOP primary Tuesday to unseat Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, each of the top three candidates has claimed to be the closest in ideology to Trump. Meanwhile, Don Blankenship has taken direct aim at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- calling him “Cocaine Mitch.” Blankenship apparently has tried to link McConnell to a 2014 news report about drugs purportedly found on a ship owned by his in-laws.

Blankenship also has accused McConnell of creating jobs for ""Chinapeople"" and said his ""China family"" has given him millions of dollars. McConnell`s wife is Trump`s transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, who was born in Taiwan. Her father, entrepreneur and philanthropist James S.C. Chao, was born in China.

The leading GOP candidates are state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and Rep. Evan Jenkins. They have until recently largely ignored Blankenship -- a former coal industry executive who served a year in prison in connection with the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion in West Virginia in 2010 that killed 29 workers.

But this weekend, Morrisey started using “robo-calls” to potential voters saying: “Convicted criminal Don Blankenship didn’t vote for President Trump and is a resident of Nevada, where he must report to his parole officer.”

On Sunday, Morrisey moved to have Blankenship disqualified from the primary for failing to submit a financial disclosure, in violation of election law and perhaps of his probation.

Blankenship’s campaign said the candidate has already spoken to his probation officer, who wasn’t concerned about the financial disclosure.

Washington Republicans have said they thought the Manchin seat was very winnable, based in part on Trump having won the state in 2016 over Democrat Hillary Clinton by 42 percentage points.

The GOP candidates in Ohio have been pushing for change. “I’m tired of the career politicians we have in Washington. That’s why I’m running,” Mike Gibbons, a Republican businessman and first-time candidate trying to unseat Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, told Fox News’ “America’s News HQ” on Saturday.

Such talk likely sounds familiar, considering Trump, a Republican, won the 2016 White House race as a successful businessman and first-time candidate vowing to “drain the swamp” of career politicians in Washington.

Trump has, however, endorsed Ohio Rep. Jim Renacci. And the president on Saturday included the four-term congressman in a public event in Cleveland.

""He’ll be fantastic,” Trump said of Renacci. ""We need his vote very badly.""

Gibbons, a fundraising co-chairman in Ohio for the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, also told Fox News that the largest personal donation he ever gave to a candidate went to Trump.

Trump won each of the four states holding primaries Tuesday.

In Indiana, Republicans are set to pick from three candidates who have spent much of the race praising Trump and bashing each other, in a bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly.

In attempts to appeal to Trump voters, they’ve adopted the president`s harsh immigration rhetoric and penchant for personal insults. The candidates have even channeled Trump by assigning derisive nicknames to one another: “Lyin’ ”Todd Rokita, Luke “Missing” Messer and “Tax Hike” Mike Braun.

Ohio also has a Democratic and Republican primary to replace term-limited GOP Gov. John Kasich.

In the GOP primary, state Attorney General Mike DeWine has a double-digit lead over Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor. Both are Trump-agenda supporters.

The top Democrats in the Ohio governor’s race are former Rep. Dennis Kucinich and Richard Cordray, a former state attorney general and onetime Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director.

Kucinich is backed by Our Revolution, the self-described “next step in the Bernie Sanders` movement.” Cordray is being endorsed by Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who helped start the federal protection bureau.

Warren is a potential 2020 presidential candidate whose efforts to regulate Wall Street have made her a champion of the party’s “progressive” wing.

Sanders, an Independent Vermont senator, ran for president in 2016 as a Democrat. The self-described Democratic socialist is weighing a potential 2020 bid and would very likely compete with Warren for the Democratic Party’s most liberal wing.

Cordray on Saturday downplayed the Warren-Sanders narrative and suggested he was more concerned about connecting with voters, citing his “kitchen table” platform aiming to address concerns such as jobs and health care.

“I don’t think it represents any big split,” he told Fox News. “We’re presenting a case to voters in Ohio.”

Polls have shown the race essentially tied or Cordray having a slight lead. Race handicappers, including the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, have rated the general election contest “lean Republican,” which means the GOP has a slight edge.

Trump won Ohio in 2016 by 8 percentage points, and the state has had a Republican governor for roughly 23 of the past 27 years.

""The far left and the far right always think they are going to dominate these elections,"" said John Weaver, a Trump critic and top strategist to Kasich. ""You may think it`s wise in a primary to handuff yourself to the president. But when the ship goes down, you may not be able to get the cuffs off.""

Still, primary candidates historically must appeal strongly to their bases to win, before they often try presenting more moderate platforms to win over general election voters.

In North Carolina, GOP Rep. Robert Pittenger faces a primary challenger who almost upset him two years ago. Pittenger features Trump prominently in his campaign. Challenger Mark Harris, a prominent Charlotte pastor, has tried to turn the table, saying Pittenger is a creature of Washington who refuses to help Trump ""drain that swamp.""

The leading Democrat for the seat is Marine veteran Dan McCready, who has raised almost $2 million, slightly more than Harris and Pittenger combined, in a district Trump won by about 12 percentage points.

Democrats must flip about two dozen Republican-held seats to reclaim a House majority, and they must do it with Republican-run legislatures having drawn many districts to the GOP`s advantage.

Fox News’ Peter Doocy and The Associated Press contributed to this report."," GOP outsider Blankenship emerges as factor in West Virginia Senate race, ahead of 4 state primaries Tuesday ",5-2018
"President Trump made an extraordinary appeal Monday for Republican primary voters to oppose former coal baron Don Blankenship in the looming West Virginia Senate primary, saying he “can’t win” in the general election.

Trump, in an early-morning tweet, instead urged voters to pick one of his two rivals, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey or Rep. Evan Jenkins.

“To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can’t win the General Election in your State...No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey!” Trump tweeted.

The president’s tweet warned voters in West Virginia ahead of its Tuesday primary, in a bid to avoid a loss in the general election come November against Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.

Morrisey and Jenkins have also stepped up their attacks on Blankenship amid signs he could be competitive in Tuesday`s election. Blankenship is a former coal industry executive who served a year in prison on a misdemeanor conviction for conspiring to violate mine safety laws, in connection with the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion in West Virginia in 2010 that killed 29 workers.

Blankenship’s parole is set to end on Wednesday—the day after West Virginians cast their ballots.

Over the weekend, though, Morrisey laid out a plan to have Blankenship disqualified from the race for failing to submit a financial disclosure—a violation of election law.

“My campaign will be informing his probation officer in Nevada about this issue right away, to determine if this refusal to comply with federal law violates the terms of his supervised release,” Morrisey said. “West Virginians don’t need a candidate who may not even be able to campaign in the state against Joe Manchin.”

Blankenship’s campaign said that if he wins the primary, it will release paperwork detailing his finances the following week. Blankenship also responded early Monday to Trump’s tweet, voicing confidence that “we’re still going to win” and saying the president must not understand West Virginia politics.

""Neither of my opponents can beat Joe Manchin without my support, but I will beat Joe Manchin even without the support of the establishment,"" he vowed. ""... Tomorrow, West Virginia will send the swamp a message—no one, and I mean no one, will tell us how to vote. As some have said, I am Trumpier than Trump and this morning proves it.""

Morissey, meanwhile, has started using “robo-calls” to potential voters saying: “Convicted criminal Don Blankenship didn’t vote for President Trump and is a resident of Nevada, where he must report to his parole officer.”

Blankenship has campaigned as an outsider against the Washington establishment. But top Republicans see similarities to GOP candidate Roy Moore, who lost the Alabama special election race amid allegations of sexual misconduct, ultimately flipping the seat blue for the first time in decades.

Blankenship has also been accused of running racially charged ads in recent weeks. The president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., came out against Blankenship just days ago, citing the Moore example.

“I hate to lose. So I’m gonna go out on a limb here and ask the people of West Virginia to make a wise decision and reject Blankenship! No more fumbles like Alabama. We need to win in November. #wv #wvpol,” Trump Jr. tweeted.

Blankenship also has taken direct aim at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. -- another move from Moore’s playbook. The candidate has called McConnell “Cocaine Mitch” and attempted to link the leader to a 2014 report about drugs purportedly found on a ship owned by his in-laws.

Blankenship has accused McConnell of creating jobs for “Chinapeople” and said his “China family” has given him millions of dollars. McConnell’s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, was born in Taiwan. Her father, entrepreneur and philanthropist James S.C. Chao, was born in China.

In addition to West Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio and Indiana will hold primary elections Tuesday ahead of the midterms. Trump won each of the four states in the 2016 presidential race.

Fox News` Joseph Weber and Peter Doocy contributed to this report."," Trump comes out against Blankenship in West Virginia Senate race, says he ‘can’t win’ ",5-2018
"On the final day of a chaotic primary campaign, a radio announcement from Don Blankenship, Republican hopeful for Senate in West Virginia, does not seek to deny or explain away charges leveled against him by his own party’s establishment.

He’s embracing those attacks instead.

“They are calling me a bigot, a moron, a despicable character and mentally ill,” Blankenship says in the ad. “But even if all of this is true, I will do a better job than they have done.”

The former coal baron has weathered significant criticism in the closing days of his campaign for his use of the phrase “China person” to describe the father of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who is married to Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and “China people” when describing those he thinks have benefitted from McConnell’s policies.

But Blankenship insists in the new advertisement that his concerns about China are driven by their economic strength, and not their citizens.

“They seem not to realize that China is a country, not a race,” Blankenship says about what he calls “the fake news.” “The establishment has given millions of our jobs to ‘China people’ and left many ‘West Virginia people’ to fend for themselves.”

Last week, in a nationally televised debate on Fox News, Blankenship further explained the origins of ‘China person.”

“I’m an ‘American person’,” Blankenship said on stage in Morgantown last Tuesday. “I don’t see this insinuation by the press that there’s something racist about saying a ‘China person.’”

WEST VIRGINIA REPUBLICAN SENATE HOPEFULS NEAR PRIMARY: A LOOK AT THE TOP THREE CANDIDATES

Blankenship is competing with Rep. Evan Jenkins, R-W.Va. and West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, among others, for a chance to challenge incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. in November’s midterm election.

Jenkins was upbeat Tuesday morning after he cast his ballot.

“I’m encouraged I feel great today,” Jenkins told Fox News. “There’s always a little bit of nervousness but that’s what this election process is all about. You just put so much into it. And today’s the day, it’s the day we’ve been looking forward to, so it’s exciting.”

President Trump, who beat Hillary Clinton by 42 points in West Virginia in 2016, tweeted on Monday that Republicans in the state should withhold support from Blankenship, out of concern that he cannot mount a successful challenge to Manchin.

Morrisey released a digital campaign ad on Monday comparing his “proven, conservative” credentials with that of his opponent.

“Patrick Morrisey is a proven conservative fighter, protecting coal jobs, pro-life, protecting our Second Amendment,” the ad said. “A convicted criminal or a proven conservative: That`s your choice.”

The 68-year old Blankenship recently served a year in prison on a misdemeanor conviction for conspiracy to violate mine safety standards.

His probation ends on Wednesday.

Fox News multimedia reporter Emilie Ikeda contributed to this report."," West Virginia primary: Blankenship brushes off `bigot,` `moron` accusations in radio ad ",5-2018
"Tuesday’s Republican and Democratic primaries in West Virginia, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina provided some clues about what to expect in the upcoming November midterm elections – including warning signs for Democrats.

In West Virginia, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey emerged as the Republican senatorial nominee in a contentious primary marked by the unusual candidacy of the controversial former coal executive Don Blankenship. Blankenship was convicted and sent to prison for a year for his role in a coal mine explosion that killed 29 workers in 2010.

The surprising popularity of Blankenship in pre-election polling – despite his loss Tuesday – demonstrated the continued appeal of anti-establishment candidates nationwide. Blankenship consistently and harshly attacked his own party`s leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and very recently used derogatory language that some characterized as racist.

Even President Trump urged voters not to cast ballots for Blankenship, despite the candidate`s suggestion that he is “Trumpier than Trump.”

A Democratic Party campaigning simply on the premise of “resistance” to President Trump and the Republicans is not enough to maximize gains in this election and beyond.

In Indiana, meanwhile, three Republicans competed to face incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, with Mike Braun emerging as the winner. The robust Republican primary may signal trouble for Donnelly and the Democrats in November, as President Trump carried the state by 19 points in 2016.

In terms of the results in Ohio, it appears the Republicans will most likely be able to also retain GOP Gov. John Kasich’s seat.

The apparent winner of the Republican nomination for governor in Ohio, Mike DeWine, is a former U.S. senator and current state attorney general. He already beat the 2018 Democratic candidate for governor Richard Cordray – the former head of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau – in the race for attorney general in 2010 and will likely be able to do so again for governor in November.

Further, Republican U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci`s victory in the race for the GOP U.S. Senate nomination in Ohio poses a serious challenge to Democratic incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown.

There are, however, some promising takeaways from Tuesday`s primaries that may provide a guidebook for the Democrats.

For instance, there continues to be a fresh crop of exciting new Democratic candidates, such as Dan McCready, a 34-year-old Marine veteran and solar energy entrepreneur running for Congress in North Carolina’s Ninth District. He has drawn comparisons to some of the most promising and compelling young Democrats in Congress like Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania.

For the Democrats to capitalize on broad disapproval of President Trump, they must support candidates like McCready and help produce a new generation of Democratic leaders with new ideas and effective policy alternatives to the Republicans, rather than relying on the same leaders who have served for as many as four decades.

Simply put, a Democratic Party campaigning simply on the premise of “resistance” to President Trump and the Republicans is not enough to maximize gains in this election and beyond.

Instead, the Democrats need to focus on fresh faces and fresh ideas. They must present effective proposals for inclusive economic growth, showing voters nationwide how voting Democratic will benefit them, their states and our nation. And they must shake off the ghosts of 2016, handing the gavel to new voices in the party.

If the Democrats are able to accomplish this, they stand a good chance of making significant gains in November. But if not, dreams of a blue wave returning control of the U.S. House and Senate and more governorships to Democratic hands may be nothing more than wishful thinking."," West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, North Carolina primaries offer November clues, warning signs for Democrats ",5-2018
"West Virginia’s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, pulled off an upset in the state’s Senate Republican primary on Tuesday, defeating former coal executive Don Blankenship and U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins in the combative and colorful race that saw a last-minute appeal from President Trump.

The results could be seen as a victory for Trump, who had urged Republican voters to reject Blankenship as doomed to lose to incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in November. It could also be seen as a win for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who clashed with Blankenship during the campaign.

Meanwhile, Indiana businessman Mike Braun and Ohio Rep. Jim Renacci will also both win their state’s Republican Senate primaries, according to the Fox News Decision Desk.

In all three states, voters picked Republican nominees to take on some of the most vulnerable incumbent Senate Democrats in this year’s midterm elections. Republicans hold a slim 51-49 advantage in the Senate.

In recent days, the contest in West Virginia has received the most national attention, with Blankenship portraying himself as a true conservative outsider. Blankenship made waves in recent days for airing a campaign ad referring to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., as “cocaine Mitch.”

On Monday, Trump appealed to the state’s primary voters to oppose Blankenship, arguing he “can’t win” in the general election.

Blankenship served a year in prison on a misdemeanor conviction for conspiring to violate mine safety laws, in connection with the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion in West Virginia in 2010 that killed 29 workers.

At his election night gathering on Tuesday, Blankenship told Fox News that he thinks the “overhang” of bad headlines about the Upper Big Branch explosion had the biggest impact.

The West Virginia Senate race is considered a toss-up in the midterm elections, as Republicans hope to unseat incumbent Joe Manchin, a Democrat who first won the seat in a 2010 special election. Manchin easily defeated challenger Paula Jean Swearengin in Tuesday’s Democratic primary.

Meanwhile in Indiana, Braun, a former state legislator who poured his own money into the race, defeated Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita. Braun will face incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly.

Braun spent millions on ads arguing he’s an outsider, but his primary rivals attacked him over voting records indicating he voted in Democratic primaries until 2012.

Braun has responded by saying he is a conservative Republican, but he voted in past Democratic primaries to have a say in local races dominated by Democrats. His rivals have asked who he voted for in the 2008 Democratic primary race between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, but Braun claims he voted for neither.

Braun was elected to the Indiana State House as a Republican in 2014.

In Ohio, Renacci, who has been endorsed by President Trump, defeated businessman Mike Gibbons in the Buckeye State’s Republican Senate primary and will face Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown in November.

"Tuesday`s GOP primary results showed both Republicans and Democrats moving toward the center as voters look ahead to this fall`s midterm elections.

Republicans are looking to increase the party`s Senate majority and maintain control of the House, while Democrats snubbed progressive candidates in favor of moderates -- including one who backed Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Patrick Morrisey, West Virginia`s attorney general, came out the winner of the state`s contentious GOP Senate primary, defeating controversial former coal executive Don Blankenship.

In Indiana`s GOP Senate primary, businessman Mike Braun, who mostly self-funded his campaign, won against U.S. Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita.

Jim Renacci won the GOP Senate primary in Ohio.

The Ohio results were attributed to the influence of President Trump, who endorsed Renacci over businessman Mike Gibbons.

Trump also made a last-minute appeal to West Virginia voters to reject Blankenship in a bid to avoid the repeat of December`s Senate race in Alabama, where Democrat Doug Jones turned the deep-red state blue -- for the first time in decades.

""To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can’t win the General Election in your State...No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey"" Trump tweeted Monday.

But Tuesday`s results also seemed to vindicate Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the subject of multiple personal attacks during the primaries. Blankenship branded McConnell ""Cocaine Mitch"" and referring to his Asian-American in-laws as ""his China family.""

The McConnell team could not hide its glee after the results. They taunted Blankenship with a photo of a smiling McConnell, with the caption reading, ""Thanks for playing, Don.""

McConnell has long sought to put the Republican house in order before the midterms, admitting that the party faces some tough fights in November.

""This is going to be a challenging election year,” McConnell told Kentucky Today in April. “We know the wind is going to be in our face. We don’t know whether it’s going to be a Category 3, 4 or 5.”

But as Republicans show signs of getting serious and choosing candidates that can appeal beyond the Trump voters, Democrats on Tuesday -- much to the chagrin of the progressive base -- favored blue-collar, middle-of-the-road candidates.

In West Virginia`s 3rd District, state Sen. Richard Ojeda clinched the victory in the Democratic primary. The win was a defeat for progressive supporters of the party, as Ojeda famously said he backed Trump over Clinton in 2016, the Washington Post reported.

Democrat Richard Cordray, meanwhile, was declared the party`s nominee for Ohio governor after he defeated former congressman and ex-Cleveland Mayor Dennis Kucinich.

Kucinich had criticized Cordray as a ""Republican-lite"" candidate who was too moderate on key issues concerning most Democrats, and was once backed by the National Rifle Association (NRA). Kucinich ran on a platform of single-payer health care, gun control and criminal justice reform.

But Cordray, who once ran the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under President Barack Obama, fought back and pointed out that Kucinich accepted $20,000 from a group with links to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

“Kucinich bothered me because of the whole Assad thing,” voter Robert Halpin, 57, told the Post. “I didn’t like Cordray because of the NRA. But in the end, weighing it, I don’t like Assad more [than I don’t like the NRA], so I went with Cordray.”

In Indiana`s 2nd District, former Republican and health care executive Mel Hall cruised to victory against candidates advocating for universal health care.

Moderate Democrats also won Tuesday in two North Carolina districts, defeating far-left challengers.

"Results of Republican primaries in four states Tuesday provided fresh evidence that President Trump changed the way to win a Republican nomination with his victory in the crowded 2016 GOP presidential primaries.

Candidate Trump spoke to Republican concerns for economic and personal security. His business background of creating jobs drove his wins among Republican primary voters, including social conservatives. His ideas for driving job creation centered on lowering taxes, reducing government regulations and getting fair trade deals for American workers.

Accordingly, Patrick Morrisey in West Virginia, Mike Braun in Indiana, and Jim Renacci in Ohio each followed the Trump playbook and won the Republican Senate nominations in their states Tuesday. They understood that connecting with voters on the issues that mattered most in deciding how to cast their ballots was the key to victory.

In West Virginia, Morrisey’s campaign pushed his support for lowering taxes, eliminating regulations put in place by President Obama and creating jobs. Morrisey defeated U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins and former coal executive Don Blankenship, who sharply attacked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. in an insurgent campaign.

Republican primary voters in West Virginia heeded the guidance of President Trump, who urged them not to vote for Blankenship, saying Blankenship could not defeat Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in the November election. Blankenship served a year in prison for a misdemeanor conviction of conspiring to violate mine safety laws involving the explosion at a West Virginia mine that killed 29 workers in 2010.

Patrick Morrisey in West Virginia, Mike Braun in Indiana, and Jim Renacci in Ohio each followed the Trump playbook. They understood that connecting with voters on the issues that mattered most in deciding how to cast their ballots was the key to victory.

GOPAC Election Fund polling found that 87 percent of Republican voters in West Virginia were less likely to vote for Manchin when they learn that he voted against President Trump’s tax cuts. This issue presents problems for Manchin with his own supporters, as 12 percent of Manchin voters are less likely to support him based on his tax vote.

The survey also discovered that more than 71 percent of Republican voters agreed with the following statement: “President Trump’s recent moves on better trade deals are designed to create and protect jobs. Fifty-three percent of total voters agree with this statement, including 60 percent of independents. Of note, almost 4 in 10 (37 percent) of Democrats agree with it as well.

In Ohio, Renacci’s first ad promoted his experience, stating his business was responsible for creating 1,500 jobs.

In Indiana, Mike Braun talked about bringing jobs that were lost to foreign countries back to his state and touted his success at creating hundreds of jobs.

The primary returns also offered a cautionary message to those candidates and consultants believing that simply repeating the refrain “drain the swamp” is the path to victory. As of this writing, only a handful of Republican incumbents at the federal or state level failed to earn Republican nominations. Republican voters may want to drain the swamp, but they haven’t concluded that their current lawmakers are the snakes and alligators that live there.

This is notable, as only one incumbent Republican U.S. senator avoided a primary challenge. Further, primary challenges to Republican state legislative incumbents has increased nearly 13 percent and contributed to the more than 17 percent increase in Republican primaries, according to Ballotpedia.

Indiana, Ohio, North Carolina and West Virginia have now launched us into the 2018 primary season. The results bring to mind the old saying “the more things change the more they stay the same.” Republicans who follow the path carved by then-candidate Trump and speak to voters concerns for personal and economic security will join the history being written of how to win Republican primary races."," GOP primary winners in West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, triumphed by following Trump`s 2016 playbook ",5-2018
"It is said that if someone is to be unpopular, they must look the part. House Republicans appear to have seized that visage for now.

In Tuesday night’s Senate primaries, things didn’t go well in West Virginia for Republican Rep. Evan Jenkins, who lost the GOP nomination to square off with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., in November. Patrick Morrisey earned that honor, vanquishing Jenkins and former coal mine executive and convict Don Blankenship.

It was a double-whammy in the Hoosier State for House Republicans Tuesday.

Not long ago, political handicappers believed that Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., would face either Rep. Luke Messer, R-Ind., or Todd Rokita, R-Ind., in the general election. Nope. Messer and Rokita excoriated each other for months. In commercials, Republican Mike Braun exploited the internecine fighting between Messer and Rokita. Braun portrayed the Republican congressmen as bickering, grade-school rivals who each thought they were hot stuff. Another Braun ad asserted there was really no difference between Messer and Rokita. That spot portrayed both congressmen as life-size, cardboard cutouts.

Braun won – now he, not Messer or Rokita, will face incumbent Donnelly in the general election.

And then there was Rep. Robert Pittenger, R-N.C. Pittenger defeated challenger Mark Harris by a mere 134 votes in the 2016 GOP primary. Pittenger wasn’t as lucky this week, becoming the first House incumbent to lose in the 2018 cycle.

The exception to poor House Republican performance on Tuesday may have been Rep. Jim Renacci, R-Ohio, who defeated Mike Gibbons to secure the GOP nomination to face Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, this fall. But House Republicans see trouble.

A primary loss always sends shockwaves through a party on Capitol Hill. Who’s next? Members of Congress are paranoid. They freak out when a greenhorn decapitates one of their own in a primary. Even the House chaplain isn’t safe. And don’t forget the lesson of Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Pa., who flipped a historically Republican district in a special election to Democratic control recently. Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., just won a special election to succeed former Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., who resigned. But Lesko’s margin of victory was less than what it should have been in that Republican stronghold.

House Republicans are fretting about losing the House. There’s chatter about a “blue wave.” Retirements and departures are off the charts. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., will soon be gone. An eye-popping nine House committee chairmen are exiting.

Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., is retiring. Then Dent announced he was quitting early. Dent is out the door at the end of the week. GOPers are nervous about how they “message” tax reform. Mike Braun was more than happy to aim the roll-call votes of Messer and Rokita back at them. Braun criticized Messer and Rokita for raising the debt ceiling and approving frameworks for “Obama trade deals.”

The issue may be how House Republicans decouple themselves from “The Swamp.”

Yes, it was only the House that managed to approve a bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare. That made good on a Republican promise dating back to 2009. But the measure died in the Senate. Sure. There’s tax reform. But it’s unclear how that message plays among poor or swing voters. Do House Republicans embrace President Trump? Or are they better suited to go it alone and build distance between themselves and the president?

Rep. Steve Stivers, R-Ohio, chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), the national organization charged with electing GOPers to the House. A surprise awaited Stivers outside the Capitol late Wednesday. Former Rep. Steve Driehaus, D-Ohio, materialized near the House steps. Driehaus served one term in Congress, defeating Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, in 2008. But Chabot rallied to topple Driehaus in 2010. Chabot’s 2008 loss is the only time Democrats have been able to unseat the Ohio Republican in a district they regularly try to flip. But on Wednesday, Driehaus had with him Aftab Pureval, the Hamilton County Clerk of Courts. Pureval just secured the Democratic nomination to face Chabot this fall. Many regard Pureval as the best chance Democrats have to unseat Chabot since Driehaus. It’s the type of district which could fall in a “blue wave.”

Driehaus wanted to introduce Pureval to Stivers – both graduates of Ohio State. The men shook hands and Stivers congratulated Pureval for winning his primary – even though he was unopposed. Of course, as NRCC chair, Stivers is confident Chabot will prevail in November. But it’s not every day that the NRCC chair encounters one of the Democrats he’s trying to beat at the base of the House steps. A not-so-subtle reminder that Democrats intend to make things rough for the GOP this fall – and how challenging it is right now to be a House Republican.

Some of this is just not endemic to congressional Republicans. It may just be that Congress is unpopular. It usually is. Republicans have run the House since January 2011. The GOP has controlled the House for all but four years since January 1995. So, it’s natural that voters may have contempt for the party that has run the institution for so long. That enmity may translate to things like a primary loss in North Carolina or the failure of several House Republicans to win Senate primaries. Congress is toxic. And the moniker “Republican Congressman” doesn’t help much. It means you’re “part of the establishment.” Part of the “swamp.” You may have voted for the $1.3 trillion omnibus package to fund the government in March – which Trump briefly threatened to veto. Perhaps you’re in favor of the farm bill which is slated to come to the House floor next week. But Trump just suggested he may veto the measure unless Congress tightens work requirement standards for people to receive food assistance.

So Jim Renacci won the contest he wanted to win: the Republican nomination for Senate. But fellow House GOPers like Jenkins, Messer, Rokita and Pittenger didn’t. Renacci “lost” a kind of universal “unpopularity contest.”

The question is how House Republicans will fare in other “unpopularity contests” these days.

"As Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe hits the one-year mark Thursday, Republicans in midterm elections have started to see an opportunity to use the Trump controversy to their advantage – by appealing to voters tired of the never-ending investigation.

Candidates in some GOP primaries this year already have worked to woo Trump supporters by arguing it’s time to end the Russia probe. Other Republicans are likely to follow suit amid a sense of Mueller investigation fatigue.

“I think you could see others embrace that messaging because the states that are up in 2018 on the Senate side are super red,” one Republican strategist involved in the midterms told Fox News.

Whether the message has appeal beyond a Republican primary audience remains to be seen, but it could serve to motivate the GOP faithful to the polls and increase turnout.

The strategist added: “I think Trump voters don’t think Mueller has anything, so that messaging could be impactful to rile up folks that sat out until 2016 to vote for Trump.”

Republicans, like Rudy Giuliani, a member of the Trump’s legal team, have predicted the Mueller probe could energize Trump supporters in November.

“It has his people much more excited now than before,” Giuliani recently told Politico.

DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN PUSHES TO IMPEACH TRUMP

But not all Republicans think it’s a worthwhile strategy in the general election, as the cloud from the Mueller probe could continue to harm the party down the ballot.

“I think the Republican posturing toward Bob Mueller in primaries became sort of a litmus test as to who was the most pro-Trump candidate,” Colin Reed, a Republican strategist and veteran of statewide campaigns in past cycles, told Fox News. “I think as the primaries start to fade into the rear view mirror, it’s going to be less and less of an issue.”

Reed said Republicans are the “law and order party,” and therefore should support giving Mueller room to complete the investigation.

“We should support guys like Robert Mueller,” Reed said. “And we shouldn’t be the ones launching attacks on him. He’s someone who was nominated by George W. Bush, confirmed overwhelmingly and commands universal support from both parties.”

In recent weeks, Republicans in competitive primaries have been calling for an end to the probe.

In Montana, GOP Senate candidate Troy Downing tweeted: “#Mueller investigation going on too long, no collusion, needs to end! #mtpol #mtsen”

In Indiana, Rep. Todd Rokita mentioned Mueller in an ad and said: “Who’s tough enough to stop the witch hunt?”

Rokita, who lost the primary to Republican businessman Mike Braun, also introduced a House resolution during the campaign demanding the Mueller investigation produce evidence of collusion, or end the investigation within 30 days.

During a debate in last month’s GOP primary in West Virginia, all three Republican candidates blasted the special counsel investigation into the Trump administration’s ties with Russia.

“With respect to the Mueller investigation, I think it needs to come to an end,” state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who went on to win the primary, said. “It`s a witch hunt. We need to stop that.”

His primary opponent, Rep. Evan Jenkins, during the debate, flatly said: “End this investigation now.”

In Mississippi, Republican Senate candidate Chris McDaniel has also taken aim at the length of Mueller’s investigation.

“We need to find ways to put, if possible, deadlines on the investigation itself. So, put simply, we don’t want a person on a witch hunt indefinitely,” McDaniel told the Washington Post.

Democrats are also trying to use the Russia probe to bolster their chances, seizing on the indictments and daily news stories to try to inflict damage on Republicans. Some Democrats, citing the Russia probe, also have backed impeachment efforts against Trump.

The president, who has called the Russia investigation “phony,” has used the impeachment talk to rile up supporters at rallies, drawing attention to comments made by California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters.

“We have to keep the House because if we listen to Maxine Waters, she’s going around saying ‘We will impeach him,’ ” Trump said last month.", Never-ending Russia probe could fuel GOP`s midterm message ,5-2018
"Democrats trying to wrestle control of Congress away from Republicans are deploying an anti-Trump strategy called, “A Better Deal,” which is essentially an anti-Trump, anti-tax reform agenda.

“Instead of delivering on its promise to drain the swamp, President Trump has become the swamp,” Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Monday.

“Rising gas prices will, as one economist put it, roughly cancel out the 2018 consumption boost from tax cuts,” Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-Calif., said Wednesday.

“The best thing we can do to stop the worst part about the Trump agenda is to win the 2018 elections,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said Thursday.

But there are Democrats running for re-election in states President Trump won easily, so talk like that isn’t tenable for everyone in the party.

“In West Virginia, people like Donald Trump, and they like Joe Manchin,” Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., told Fox News. “And you know what, we can work very well together.”

Manchin’s campaign has internal polling showing he has an early lead over Republican challenger, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who recently emerged from a bruising primary plagued by personal attacks.

So don’t expect to see Manchin, who is seeking a second full term, adopting the midterm strategy touted by Pelosi or Schumer.

“It’s not me,” Manchin said. “If they’re going to adopt a policy up here they think is their winning ticket, I don’t think it’s a winning ticket for me at all.”

Republicans candidates hoping to help the party retain or expand its congressional majorities are field-testing messages focused on the benefits of tax reform, a reduction in regulations, and the appointments of conservatives to courtrooms across the country.

“If you look at the Supreme Court nominations, our judges right now are filling the federal courts, making good decisions based on the Constitution, not trying to be activist judges,” Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., told Fox News.

Senate hopefuls are also offering themselves as helpful to a president who has struggled at times to convince lawmakers in his own party to align with his policy proposals.

“The president`s agenda is to save the middle class and that`s what we’re working toward,” Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley told Fox News, about his campaign to unseat Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.

Hawley, considered a top GOP recruit this cycle, is also borrowing anti-establishment rhetoric reminiscent of President Trump’s, calling McCaskill a member of the “D.C. Cartel,” which has “feathered its own nest.”

Borrowing from President Trump’s 2016 phrase-book has already proven successful for Senate primary winners in West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.

"Rep. Tom Garrett, R-Va., announced on May 28 that he would not seek re-election as he battles with alcoholism.

""Any person -- Republican or Democrat or independent -- who has known me for any period of time and has any integrity knows two things: I am a good man, and I`m an alcoholic,"" Garrett said in a Memorial Day video message.

On average, 22 House members retire each cycle, Roll Call reported. But this year has seen a record number of GOP lawmakers leaving Capitol Hill.

So far, 44 Republicans have either resigned, retired, been appointed to another position, lost elections or announced gubernatorial bids.

Here’s the list of Republicans, in the House and Senate, who have announced they will not seek re-election:

Joe Barton

Embattled Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, announced on Nov. 30, 2017, that he was retiring from Congress.

Barton’s announcement came after pressure for him to end his re-election bid mounted. Barton, 68, apologized after a nude photo of him surfaced on social media. He said he engaged in consensual sexual relationships while he was estranged from his second wife.

""I’ve always listened to people in Texas and worked for them in Washington, and I’ve been listening to a lot of people the last week in Texas,"" Barton told the Dallas Morning News in November. ""There are enough people who lost faith in me that it’s time to step aside and let there be a new voice ... so I am not going to run for re-election.""

Jim Bridenstine

Rep. Jim Bridenstine, R-Okla., promised his third term would be his last when he ran for re-election in 2015.

And in April 2018, before that third term was completed, Bridenstine was confirmed by the Senate to become the newest NASA administrator, meaning the 42-year-old resigned his congressional seat.

Jason Chaffetz

Jason Chaffetz of Utah resigned from Congress in June 2017.

“My life has undergone some big changes over the last 18 months. Those changes have been good. But as I celebrated my 50th birthday in March, the reality of spending more than 1,500 nights away from my family over eight years hit me harder than it had before,” Chaffetz said at the time.

He later signed with Fox News as a contributor. John Curtis, a Republican, won a special election in November to replace him.

Thad Cochran

Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced on March 5 that he will resign effective April 1, citing health issues.

""I regret my health has become an ongoing challenge,"" Cochran said in an online statement. ""I intend to fulfull my responsiblities and commitments to the people of Mississippi and the Senate through the completion of the 2018 appropriations cycle.""

The 80-year-old stayed home for a month last fall with urinary tract infections. He returned to Washington in October, giving Republicans the majority they needed to pass a budget plan.

Cochran has been serving in the Senate since 1978. He`s the tenth longest-serving senator in U.S. history, according to the statement.

Republican Gov. Phil Bryant will appoint a temporary replacement. Then a special election will be held to fill the rest of the term, through January 2021.

Bob Corker

Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., announced on Sept. 27, 2017, that he will not seek a third term in 2018.

Corker, 65, had previously said that he “couldn’t imagine” serving more than two terms. Corker has often feuded with President Trump.

Ryan Costello

Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Ryan Costello said in February 2018 that he would not seek re-election. Costello, 41, served in Congress since 2015.

Costello told The Daily Local his decision not to run again was both political and personal.

""Whether it`s [Trump`s rumored affair with porn star] Stormy Daniels, or passing an omnibus spending bill that the president threatens to veto after promising to sign, it`s very difficult to move forward in a constructive way,"" Costello said. ""Plus, I think there`s a lot of hate out there, from the left especially, and it`s a very angry environment.""

Charlie Dent

Pennsylvania Rep. Charlie Dent first said on Sept. 7, 2017, that he would not seek re-election. But the seven-term congressman later decided that he would not finish out his term, instead electing to leave Congress by May.

""After discussions with my family and careful reflection, I have decided to leave Congress in the coming weeks,"" Dent, 58, said in a April 17 statement. ""It is my intention to continue to aggressively advocate for responsible governance and pragmatic solutions in the coming years.""

Dent has been openly critical of Trump. He voted against party lines and a repeal of ObamaCare last year and warned the president against firing the special counsel in the Russia investigation.

Jimmy Duncan

Rep. Jimmy Duncan Jr., R-Tenn., announced in July 2017 that he would not seek re-election.

In announcing his retirement, Duncan, 70, thanked conservatives who supported him against “recent attacks against me from the far left.”

“I have decided I wanted to spend less time in airports, airplanes and traveling around the district and more time with my family, especially my nine grandchildren, who all live in Knoxville,” Duncan said. “I love my job, but I love my family more.”

Roll Call reported that Duncan’s sister, state Sen. Becky Duncan Massey, could launch a bid for his empty seat.

Blake Farenthold

Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, resigned from Congress on April 6, 2018.

""While I planned on serving out the remainder of my term in Congress, I know in my heart it’s time for me to move along and look for new ways to serve,"" he said in a statement.

The news came after Farenthold, 56, said in December that he was not going to to run for re-election after multiple accusations of sexual harassment, misconduct and inappropriate behavior surfaced.

The House Ethics Committee had said it was expanding a probe into sexual harassment allegations against the lawmaker, which would include an investigation into whether he retaliated against a former staff member for complaining of such behavior. Congressional sources said Farenthold paid an $84,000 settlement using taxpayer money.

Jeff Flake

Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., announced on Oct. 24, 2017, that he would not seek re-election. Flake is an ardent critic of Trump.

Flake, 55, faced a tough re-election campaign in Arizona against Kelli Ward, a physician who has also challenged Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Trump has previously said that it was “great” that Ward was running against a “toxic” Flake.

In announcing that he wouldn’t run for re-election, Flake said the GOP is becoming a “backward-looking minority party.”

“It is clear in this moment that a traditional conservative, who believes in limited government and free markets, who is devoted to free-trade, who is pro-immigration, has a narrower and narrower path to nomination in the Republican Party, the party that has for so long defined itself by its belief in those things,” Flake said.

Trent Franks

Arizona Rep. Trent Franks announced on Dec. 8, 2017, that his resignation would take effect immediately, despite previously announcing that he`d leave the House in January due to sexual misconduct allegations against him.

He attributed the change in date to his wife`s admittance to the hospital but reports later surfaced alleging Frank repeatedly pressed a former aide to carry his child, offering her $5 million to act as a surrogate.

Franks’ announcement came as the House Ethics Committee said it was looking into whether he “engaged in conduct that constitutes sexual harassment and/or retaliation for opposing sexual harassment.”

Franks, 60, maintained that he never physically intimidated, coerced or had sexual contact with any member of his staff. He said he discussed surrogacy issues with some of his female staff which made them “uncomfortable.”

The conservative congressman said that “in the midst of this current cultural and media climate, I am deeply convinced I would be unable to complete a fair House Ethics investigation before distorted and sensationalized versions of this story would put me, my family, my staff and noble colleagues in the House of Representatives through hyperbolized public excoriation.”

Rodney Frelinghuysen

Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen said he will retire at the end of his term.

The New Jersey Republican, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, was facing his first competitive re-election race in decades.

Frelinghuysen, 72, was first elected in the 1994 GOP wave that put Republicans in control of both chambers. He hails from a New Jersey political dynasty that dates to the late 1700s. His father, Peter, served in the House for two decades.

Tom Garrett

Rep. Tom Garrett, R-Va., announced on May 28 that he would not seek re-election as he battles with alcoholism.

""Any person -- Republican or Democrat or independent -- who has known me for any period of time and has any integrity knows two things: I am a good man, and I`m an alcoholic,"" Garrett, 46, said in a Memorial Day video message.

The announcement comes after reports of turmoil in Garrett`s office. His chief of staff abruptly quit in May 2018, and staffers told Politico they were made into the congressman`s ""personal servants"" -- running errands, picking up after his dog and being his wife`s chauffeur.

Garrett has been in Congress since 2017.

Bob Goodlatte

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte announced on Nov. 9, 2017, that he would not seek re-election, saying it is “the right time to step aside.”

The Virginia lawmaker, who has been in Congress since 1993, said he has discussed whether to run for re-election with his wife, Maryellen, every two years. This year’s conversation, Goodlatte said, was different.

“With my time as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee ending in December 2018, this is a natural stepping-off point and an opportunity to begin a new chapter of my career and spend more time with my family, particularly my granddaughters,” Goodlatte, 65, said in a letter.

Trey Gowdy

House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy announced on Jan. 31 that he would not seek re-election or any other political office.

The South Carolina Republican, who until recently also sat on the House Ethics Committee, said he would be “returning to the justice system.”

“Whatever skills I may have are better utilized in a courtroom than in Congress, and I enjoy our justice system more than our political system,” the 53-year-old said. “As I look back on my career, it is the jobs that both seek and reward fairness that are most rewarding.”

Gowdy also oversaw the divisive House investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack.

Gregg Harper

Rep. Gregg Harper, R-Miss., announced in January 2018 that he would not seek re-election at the end of his term. The House Administration Committee chairman said he tried to make Congress more transparent and accountable during his tenure.

Harper, 61, was first elected in 2008. He said “10 years will be long enough” for him to have served in Congress.

Harper was an ardent supporter of anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training in the U.S. House. His committee held a hearing in November 2017 regarding sexual misconduct involving current House members.

After the hearing, House Speaker Paul Ryan announced that the House would begin to require anti-harassment and anti-discrimination trainings for members and their staff.

Orrin Hatch

Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, is the longest serving Senate Republican. He announced on Jan. 2, 2018 – after weeks of speculation – that he would not seek re-election at the end of his term.

The 84-year-old said Trump told him during a recent visit to Utah that he was a “fighter.”

“But every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves. And for me, that time is soon approaching,” Hatch said in a video message posted on social media.

“I’ve authored more bills that have become law than any member of Congress alive today,” Hatch also said, adding that one of his “proudest legislative achievements” was his work with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which ensures religious freedoms are protected.

Jeb Hensarling

Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, announced on Oct. 31, 2017, that he will not run for re-election in 2018.

""Today I am announcing that I will not seek re-election to the US Congress in 2018. Although service in Congress remains the greatest privilege of my life, I never intended to make it a lifetime commitment, and I have already stayed far longer than I had originally planned,"" Hensarling, 61, said, according to the Dallas Morning News.

Hensarling also added that he wants to spend more time with his family.

Darrell Issa

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., will retire at the end of his term, he announced on Jan. 10, 2018.

Issa, 64, only barely won re-election in 2016. He beat his Democratic challenger, Douglas Applegate, by less than one percentage point for California’s 49th congressional district.

This seat was seen as a toss-up that could potentially go to a Democrat in 2018, even prior to Issa’s impending retirement.

“Representing you has been the privilege of a lifetime,” Issa, who has been in Congress since 2001, said in a statement.

But Issa could come eventually return to Congress. He is reportedly considering running for Rep. Duncan Hunter’s seat, should the Republican decide to retire as well.

Lynn Jenkins

Rep. Lynn Jenkins, R-Kan., announced on Jan. 25, 2017, that she would not seek re-election or run for another office.

Jenkins, 54, said she wanted to return to the private sector although she was highly rumored to be a possible gubernatorial candidate in Kansas.

Sam Johnson

Longtime Texas Rep. Sam Johnson announced his retirement on Jan. 6, 2017.

“For me, the Lord has made clear that the season of my life in Congress is coming to an end,” Johnson, 87, said.

Johnson is an Air Force veteran who was a prisoner of war at the infamous Hanoi Hilton in Vietnam.

Frank LoBiondo

Rep. Frank LoBiondo, R-N.J., will retire from Congress at the end of his term. The 72-year-old assumed his seat in 1995.

LoBiondo’s retirement opens up a seat in a potential swing district. Trump won it in 2016, but former President Barack Obama took the district in 2012.

The GOP lawmaker has differed from his party on certain issues. He voted against the budget framework and has expressed concerns about Republicans’ tax plan, specifically the move to eliminate certain state and local deductions.

Patrick Meehan

Rep. Patrick Meehan, R-Pa., said he would not seek re-election in January 2018, but in April, he announced he would resign his seat effective immediately.

""With the knowledge I would not be standing for another term, I have decided that stepping down now is in the interest of the constituents I have been honored to serve,"" he said in a statement. ""I have stayed to fight for important priorities like fully funding our troops, increasing support for medical research and preserving promising clean energy solutions. And now that work is accomplished.""

The decision not to seek re-election, the 62-year-old said, was made following reports that he allegedly used taxpayer money to fund a settlement to a former aide who claimed he sexually harassed her. Meehan called the revelations ""a major distraction"" and said he needed ""to own it because it is my own conduct that fueled the matter.""

Meehan has acknowledged telling a longtime former aide that he considered her a ""soul mate"" and admitted acting ""selfishly"" after learning that she was dating someone else. The former aide filed a sexual misconduct complaint against the lawmaker last summer, and he allegedly used taxpayer money in the settlement.

In his resignation, Meehan promised to repay the $39,000 back to the U.S. Treasury and said he did not want to put his staff through an Ethics Committee probe, even though he believed he would have been cleared of wrongdoing.

""Though I wish my time in Congress would have finished in a more satisfying manner, I am proud of our accomplishments and thank the residents of my District for their confidence in me over the last eight years,"" he said. ""I recognize that there are constituents who are disappointed in the manner in which I handled the situation that lead to my decision not to seek re-election and wish I had done better by them.""

Tim Murphy

GOP Rep. Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania announced on Oct. 5, 2017, that he would resign his position in Congress. The news followed reports that the lawmaker, who has publicly been staunchly anti-abortion, had an affair and asked his mistress to get an abortion when they believed she was pregnant.

Murphy, 65, said he will “take personal time to seek help as my family and I continue to work through our personal difficulties.”

Robert Pittenger

In May 2018, Rep. Robert Pittenger, R-N.C., lost the Republican primary for re-election. A three-term incumbent, Pittenger narrowly lost to Rev. Mark Harris, a Southern Baptist preacher.

Pittenger, 69, was the first incumbent to lose in the 2018 primary cycle.

Ted Poe

In a Twitter message, Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, announced that he will not seek re-election.

“I am grateful for the honor and privilege to represent the best people in America, Texas’s Second Congressional District. Thanks to the good Lord, I’m in good health, but it’s time for the next step,” Poe, 69, said on Nov. 7, 2017.

He added that he’s planning to spend more time with his grandchildren. All 12 of them were born since he’s been in Congress, Poe said. He assumed office in 2005.

Dave Reichert

After serving seven terms in Congress, Rep. Dave Reichert, R-Wash., said he would not seek re-election on Sept. 6, 2017. A former sheriff, Reichert, 67, represents a district that is being targeted by Democrats in 2018. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton won the area in the 2016 election.

Reichert said the decision to retire from Congress was “the right one for my family and me.”

Tom Rooney

After nearly 10 years in Congress, Rep. Tom Rooney, R-Fla., said he will not be running for re-election.

Rooney, 47, said in a statement that “it’s time to ‘hang em up’"" and thanked his constituents for ""allowing [him] the opportunity to serve them in Washington.""

“I look forward to serving Florida again in the future in a different capacity. Keep the faith. Slainte!” the congressman said.

According to the Tampa Bay Times, Rooney’s decision was not too surprising, given his frustration with Washington. The publication also said Rooney was “deeply affected” by the shooting at a practice for the Congressional Baseball Game in June 2017.

Ileana Ros-Lehtinen

Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., announced on April 30, 2017, that she would not seek re-election. Ros-Lehtinen, 65, has been a congresswoman since 1989.

“The most difficult challenge is not to simply keep winning elections; but rather the more difficult challenge is to not let the ability to win define my seasons,” she said.

Born in Havana, Cuba, Ros-Lehtinen is considered a moderate Republican who was not a strong supporter of Trump.

Dennis Ross

Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Fla., announced on April 11 that he would not seek re-election. Ross, 58, has been in Congress since 2011.

“I am grateful for this incredible opportunity to serve and I look forward to the next chapter of my life which will include, in some way, continued public service,” Ross said in a Facebook statement. “I never viewed this amazing opportunity as a job or a career. My home has been and will continue to be in Lakeland, Florida.”

As a lawmaker, he served on multiple House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittees, including Federal Workforce, U.S. Postal Service and Labor Policy.

Ed Royce

On Jan. 8, 2018, Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., announced that he would not seek re-election.

Royce, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that he wanted to completely focus his final year as committee chairman on the ""urgent threats facing our nation.""

Royce, 66, is serving out his 13th term.

In an announcement detailing his decision to not seek re-election, Royce cited the tax cut bill passed in December and the crackdown on the global ivory trade as some of his accomplishments.

Paul Ryan

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., announced on April 11 that he would finish out his term in Congress but not seek re-election.

Ryan was first elected to Congress in 1998 and has served as House Speaker since October 2015.

In his announcement, Ryan, 48, said he wanted to spend more time with his wife and three children. The speaker was known for sleeping in his Capitol Hill office and traveling back to Wisconsin weekly.

“I have given this job everything I had, and I have no regrets whatsoever for having accepted this responsibility,” Ryan said. “This has been one of the two greatest honors of my life.”

Ryan said it’s “easy” for his job “to take over everything in your life.”

As speaker, Ryan was instrumental the passage of the 2017 tax reform bill – an issue that is close to his heart. He said reforming the nation’s tax code and increasing defense spending were “lasting victories that make this country more prosperous and more secure for decades to come.”

Despite disagreements between the two, President Trump called Ryan a “truly good man” who will “leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question” on social media.

Bill Shuster

Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, Rep. Bill Shuster, 57, told the Washington Examiner that even though he doesn’t plan to seek re-election, he still hopes to work with Trump on passing a large infrastructure bill before he leaves Congress.

The Pennsylvania Republican announced on Jan. 2, 2017 that he would not seek re-election in November. He told the publication that as he would not be coming back to Washington as a congressman, he could better work with parties on both sides of the aisle during his remaining time in office.

Lamar Smith

Rep. Lamar Smith, a 70-year-old Republican serving Texas, announced on Nov. 2, 2017 that he would be retiring from Congress at the end of his term.

Smith, who chairs the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, has served in the House of Representatives since 1987.

Luther Strange

Luther Strange, R-Ala., was appointed to Jeff Sessions’ old Senate after he was picked to be the attorney general.

But Strange, 65, lost in the special primary election earlier in 2017 to Roy Moore. Moore became the GOP nominee for the Senate and eventually lost to Democrat Doug Jones.

In his farewell speech to the Senate in December, Strange encouraged his fellow lawmakers to remain committed to bipartisanship.

“To lose the art of balance and compromise in this body is to lose something essentially American,” he said.

Pat Tiberi

Ohio Rep. Pat Tiberi, 55, announced on Oct. 19, 2017, that he would resign from Congress in early 2018 to lead the Ohio Business Roundtable as the association`s president.

Serving as a Republican congressman for 17 years, Tiberi`s final day in Congress was Jan. 15, 2018.

Dave Trott

Rep. Dave Trott, R-Mich., announced on Sept. 11, 2017 that he would not seek re-election.

Trott, 57, will retire at the end of his second term. His district is Republican-leaning, but analysts told the Detroit News that a Democrat could flip the seat.

Republican lawmakers seeking another office

Lou Barletta

Rep. Lou Barletta is the Republican nominee for Senate in Pennsylvania. He is expected to face incumbent Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat, in the fall.

Barletta, 62, had the backing of Trump in the primary election.

Diane Black

Having served in Congress for four terms, Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., announced in August 2017 that she would run for governor in her state.

“Most people in politics say the right things, but they never fight for the right things,” Black said in a video announcing her candidacy. “They`re too meek or maybe even too weak ... I don`t back down.”

Black, 67, was the first female chair of the powerful House Budget Committee, and she was in that position during the nation’s tax overhaul. She resigned as chairwoman last year to focus on her gubernatorial race.

Marsha Blackburn

Longtime Rep. Marsha Blackburn is hoping to trade in her congresswoman title for that of senator. The 65-year-old is running for Senate in Tennessee.

Blackburn has represented Tennessee in Congress since 2003.

Kevin Cramer

After waffling on the decision a bit, Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., decided in February 2018 to run for Senate.

Cramer, 57, will challenge incumbent Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in the fall, if he wins the Republican primary in June.

Ron DeSantis

Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., officially launched his bid for governor in January 2018.

A former Navy lawyer, DeSantis, 39, is an ardent support of Trump and was praised by the president on social media last year.

“Congressman Ron DeSantis is a brilliant young leader, Yale and then Harvard Law, who would make a GREAT Governor of Florida. He loves our Country and is a true FIGHTER!” Trump tweeted a month before DeSantis made his official announcement.

Evan Jenkins

Instead of seeking re-election, Rep. Evan Jenkins, R-W.V., ran for Senate. Jenkins, 57, lost the primary election to state Attorney Gen. Patrick Morrisey.

State Delegate Carol Miller won the Republican nomination for West Virginia`s 3rd congressional district to replace him.

Raul Labrador

Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, announced in the summer of 2017 that he would finish his current term but then run for governor of Idaho in 2018 instead of re-election, according to HuffPost.

Labrador, 50, is a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus.

Martha McSally

Rep. Martha McSally has represented Arizona in Congress since 2015.

But now, the Air Force veteran has her sights on the U.S. Senate. The 52-year-old has to beat out a crowded field of Republicans for her party`s nomination. Politico named her one of the top 10 candidates to watch in 2018.

Luke Messer

Rep. Luke Messer, R-Ind., sought his party`s nomination for Senate instead of running for re-election. Messer, 49, lost the primary to businessman Mike Braun.

Greg Pence, the brother of the vice president, won the Republican primary for Indiana`s 6th congressional district to replace Messer.

Kristi Noem

Instead of seeking re-election in 2018, Rep. Kristi Noem, R-S.D., announced in November 2016 that she will run for governor instead.

Noem, 46, officially kicked off her gubernatorial bid last year.

Steve Pearce

New Mexico Rep. Steve Pearce opted to run for governor of his state instead of re-election.

Pearce, 70, has been a congressman for more than 12 years. He told the Albuquerque Journal that as governor he would focus on the exodus of young people leaving the state.

Jim Renacci

Rep. Jim Renacci, R-Ohio, is running for Senate in his state against incumbent Sherrod Brown.

He originally planned to run for governor. Renacci, 59, has served in Congress since 2011.

Todd Rokita

Rather than running for re-election, Rep. Todd Rokita instead sought the GOP nomination for Senate in his state. Rokita, 48, lost the primary to Mike Braun.

Rokita first assumed his congressional seat in 2011. State Rep. Jim Baird won the Republican primary for Rokita`s seat. Baird`s campaign has said it won`t step aside if Rokita decides to want to keep his current seat.

"Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., had the sharpest plummet in job approval of any senator in the country according to a poll out Thursday, marking more bad news for a senator already labeled vulnerable in November and facing an ethics complaint.

The Morning Consult poll found that Manchin’s approval rating fell to 43 percent for the first quarter of 2018 – a 17-point drop from the fourth quarter of 2017, with a 44 percent disapproval rating.

Representing coal country, Manchin voted for President Donald Trump’s top two nominees to run the Environmental Protection Agency. The website FiveThirtyEight ranks Manchin as having a 60.3 percent pro-Trump voting record. Manchin, however, voted against tax reform and stood with Democrats in defending ObamCare.

In the once solidly-blue state previously represented in the Senate by unapologetic liberals Robert Byrd and Jay Rockefeller, Manchin is trying to cling to his seat in a year projected to be good for Democrats.

“It’s been trending red since the 2000 presidential election when the catalyst was guns first and then coal and the carbon tax,” said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor with the Cook Political Report, which ranks this Senate race a tossup.

“By 2012, the die was cast. The only Democrats who could survive were ones like Manchin,” Duffy told Fox News. “If he loses, it would cement the idea that Democrats could not elect anyone statewide. The presidential performance has a lot to do with how a party performs in a state. He’s still a blue dog in a Senate where it’s hard to be in the middle. But, when push comes to shove, he usually votes with Senate Democrats.”

Trump carried West Virginia by 42 points in 2016, and has had the highest approval rating there than in any other state, according to Gallup. And, the president made an aggressive case against Manchin last week during a visit to White Sulphur Springs, W.Va.

“He votes against everything, and he voted against our tax cuts, and that was bad. He also voted against medical help and healthcare. And that`s bad, and we can`t have it,” Trump said, later adding, “You`re going to have a chance to get a senator that’s going to vote our program.”

What Manchin has going in his favor is a divided Republican field. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, Rep. Evan Jenkins and former coal executive Don Blankenship are competing in the May 8 primary.

Business and labor endorsements could also sharpen the incumbent’s image as a centrist. The state’s AFL-CIO, United Mine Workers, the West Virginia Hospitality & Travel Association and HuntPAC, the political action committee for the Huntington Regional Chamber of Commerce, have each endorsed him for re-election.

“It means so much to have the support of both business leaders and labor in this campaign because there is so much more we can do when we are united,” Manchin said in a press release. “All sides must come together to create good-paying jobs with benefits for our people.”

""He votes against everything, and he voted against our tax cuts, and that was bad. He also voted against medical help and healthcare. And that`s bad, and we can`t have it. You`re going to have a chance to get a senator that’s going to vote our program.” - President Donald Trump

Manchin campaign spokesman Grant Herring did not respond to phone and email inquiries from Fox News for this story.

Manchin also faces a potential probe by the Senate Select Committee on Ethics over his interest in West Virginia hotels facing default and litigation, after the conservative government watchdog group Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT) filed an ethics complaint.

The election will likely be long over before the ethics committee takes up the case, Duffy said.

“Republicans have been hitting that for months,” Duffy said. “But it fits into their larger message that this isn’t the Joe Manchin you knew as governor.”

Manchin is the co-owner of AA Properties, LLC, along with his longtime political aide Larry Puccio. The company was reportedly listed among borrowers in the original $15 million loan for the Hilton Garden Inn in Morgantown, which went into default. They were also listed as investors in a case of default regarding a $19.6 million loan on hotels in Clarksburg and Elkins.

The state government is suing to gain hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes collected by the hotels but not passed along to the state coffers. Magnolia and Harrison county governments also are trying to collect thousands in unpaid taxes collected by the hotels.

Manchin’s Senate disclosure form reportedly states he had between $50,001 to $100,000 invested in AA Properties, with earnings of $11,200 in 2016.

Asked about the complaint, Manchin Senate spokesman Jonathan Kott told Fox News, “I ignored your email for a reason. I have nothing to say.” Minutes later, he replied in an email, “Your questions have been asked and answered.”

Kott told the Charleston Gazette-Mail in August, “Senator Manchin and Larry Puccio have no affiliation or stake in AA Property Group and no ownership interest or stock in Mountain Blue Hotel Group or the Hilton Garden Inn.” However, Kott later clarified his statement, telling the Washington Free Beacon, “Senator Manchin has part ownership in AA, but AA has no ownership or affiliation with the hotels.”

Also in August, West Virginia Metro News reported Manchin said he was unaware because his investments are in a blind trust. “The only thing I’m told is that we have no involvement whatsoever.”

Puccio has also reportedly denied involvement.

The complaint, filed in February, says Manchin has had a stake in AA Properties since he was elected to the Senate in 2010, but didn’t provide details about the “underlying assets.”

“From a natural human perspective he may be embarrassed by the bankruptcies and litigation, Clearly, without a hard assessment, we don’t know what all those assets are,” Kendra Arnold, executive director of FACT, told Fox News. “Full disclosure is the only way to assess potential conflicts of interests. We need to know exactly the businesses and business entities.”

The ethics complaint says failure to provide required information on financial disclosure forms is subject to a fine of up to $11,000.

“Instead, Senator Manchin has profited from AA Properties while repeatedly failing to tell his constituents about the nature and origin of those profits,” the FACT ethics complaint states.

“In recent court filings AA Properties has been identified as having an investment interest in Emerald Coast Realty, Mountain Blue Hotel Group, and Mountain West Hospitality LLC. Each of these companies were involved in multi-million dollar lawsuits in which AA Properties was identified as an investor, evidenced by loan documents filed in the cases of Mountain Blue and Mountain West.”

"The race to replace one of the most vulnerable Democratic senators in the country has been upended by a primary candidate – with a probation officer.

This time last year, Don Blankenship was close to completing a yearlong prison sentence following a misdemeanor conviction for conspiring to violate federal mine safety standards. Blankenship was the CEO of the Massey Energy Company when an explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine killed 29 miners.

Now, he’s jumped into a race with West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and Congressman Evan Jenkins, R-W.V., to replace incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., in a state President Trump carried by 42 points in 2016.

Blankenship insists his candidacy is more than just an attempt to get even with Manchin, who was governor in 2010 when the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster occurred, and later accused Blankenship of having “blood on his hands.”

“Manchin needs to be defeated for the sake of West Virginia, it’s not for revenge,” Blankenship tells FOX News.

Blankenship believes there are enough redemption-minded Republicans in the state who share his belief that the charges were inspired by political enemies in the federal government.

“It probably doesn’t surprise them that much that Obama and his people would come after me, and they did and they failed because they didn’t win any of the felony convictions,” Blankenship said.

Before the polarizing Blankenship entered the fray, this primary contest was already contentious.

Morrisey, the state’s attorney general, has tried to remind voters that Jenkins used to be a registered Democrat.

“I think Evan Jenkins is a liberal,” Morrisey said.

Jenkins defends against that charge, and explains that he left the Democratic Party because the platform veered too far to the left.

He’s also working to define his opponent, Morrisey, as a carpetbagger from the Garden State.

Morrisey “ran for Congress in the year 2000 on a theme that he was Jersey through and through, he ran for Congress in New Jersey,” Jenkins said.

Jenkins and Morrisey share one goal in this race though: to get as close as possible to President Trump.

“I am the only candidate who actually supported Donald Trump in the election, I’m the only candidate who actually has an established working relationship with the president,” Jenkins said, while boasting about high marks he’s received by National Right to Life and the National Rifle Association.

But the state’s attorney general insists he’s been working with the Trump administration, too, assisting in its efforts to roll back environmental regulations.

“This is a President that wants to shake up Washington,” Morrisey told FOX. “Washington is completely broken and you need someone who is willing to go and fix it.”

The Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., doesn’t enjoy the same across-the-board support the Republican President does from the trio of D.C.-hopefuls.

Ask all three, get three different answers.

Morrisey is non-committal about supporting McConnell as majority leader, telling FOX: “I’ve always said that I’m going to look at these issues after the election.”

Blankenship wants to replace McConnell.

“We have a president who wants to make significant change and put America first, and we need a Senate leader who is wanting to do the same thing,” he said.

Only Jenkins wants McConnell to continue controlling his party’s path in the Senate, crediting him with helping the Trump administration advance its first Supreme Court nominee.

“Our country is so much better off,” Jenkins said, “because we have Neil Gorsuch on the U.S Supreme court.”

Manchin declined to be interviewed for this story.

On the roster: The supremacy of the internet mob - McConnell keeps Dems off campaign trail - Bipartisan gang has votes to force DREAMer vote - DOJ recommends prosecution for McCabe - Toot, toot



THE SUPREMACY OF THE INTERNET MOB

The era of the internet mob is turning out to be just as terrible as everyone thought it would be.



We have seen for years instances where people, deservedly and undeservedly, are dragged around by their nose hair on the internet.



But the trend does seem to be accelerating.



The photograph of the protestor using the megaphone to scream in the face of a Starbucks employee who stoically stands, eyes pointed at the horizon is a pretty good meme for our moment.



In the case of Starbucks, they deserved an internet beat down because of what happened to two African American businessmen who were humiliated by a Philadelphia Starbucks location and the police. If any of your friends ever tell you that racism is not a thing, just tell them about the two guys who showed up early for a meeting getting arrested.



Starbucks may have deserved the dragging but are we satisfied with the vehicle of justice?



Kevin Williamson seems to have found a home at Commentary Magazine. When he was writing for National Review he was the conservative who liberals loved to hate, writing trenchant analysis but steering away from invective and maintaining a fair-minded spirit.



But when they went to hire Williamson at The Atlantic, the outrage mob, while small in number, was ferocious in intensity. The Atlantic reneged and fired Williamson in a matter of days. He did not last even one Scaramucci Unit.



Williamson was dragged for having been flip about executing women for having abortions. Now, it’s nobody’s business but the Atlantic’s who they hire and who they fire. A liberal magazine is certainly within its rights to not employ writers who are pro-life, particularly ones who express extreme views. But, there are many stupider things written by even smarter people who continue to keep their employs.



Williamson’s firing provided a psychic release for liberal Americans who have been frustrated about their flagship newspaper, The New York Times, developing and maintaining a useful fan of ideological diversity.



This note also happens to be acquainted with a television network that is dragged daily. Sometimes with cause, sometimes unfairly, sometimes at the behest of well-funded organizations, sometimes organically – but no one could say infrequently. So we will not pretend to be impartial in the matter.



However, we should acknowledge that as virtual life and real life approach singularity that we better start having smarter conversations about how our republic treats mob justice.



The first famous incident involved a PR executive who said something insensitive about AIDS in Africa and got fired and was made a pariah in a couple of hours. Twitter so far has proved only to be useful for two things: Jokes and ruining people’s lives.



Part of the reason for its efficacy in the latter is that getting a mob together takes almost no effort at all. If you have a catchy cause and have proficient social media skills you can work wonders. The secret is that mob instigators ask very little of the participants they recruit.



A comment, a re-tweet or even just a “like” is all it takes. And in a country of 325 million people getting a million folks to make a sacrifice-free commitment to a cause isn’t so tough.



Now, every culture shuns. Ours has always preserved sanction of public shaming and shunning. And it’s a useful tool in maintaining societal norms.



But as our government ceases to function in normal and needed ways the power of social media vigilantes has grown.



We are not in the habit of proposing legislation, save our only endorsement – making Election Day a holiday – but we would submit that this issue needs to be addressed in some manner.



This new regime is having a corrosive effect on politics and government.



The fact that many, if not most, participants in the anti-Starbucks mob had opinions before they had facts. In this case, the facts seem to well support a considerable degree of outrage. Starbucks is within its rights to kick people out of their shops who do not purchase the company’s products, but treating two apparently courteous and professional men like dangerous criminals reflects some serious bias issues.



But is the response just?



In the old days when you wanted to have a mob you had to get people on buses, get their torches lit and somebody had to stop off and buy some pitchforks. If you are willing to go that far for a cause it’s likely that you would have learned at least a little about it.



In the cheap and easy mob era there are few checks on excess. As our government stultifies we are increasingly governed by corporate entities. Americans rely on businesses for more and more of the structure in which we live. That’s a conversation we’re only just beginning as it relates to Facebook and other entities that manipulate digital reality for profit. The profit motive generally produces good outcomes if only because it is predictable. Greed may be loveless but it is at least clarifying.



But without government as an effective intermediary the mob has one of the few checks on unscrupulous or immoral conduct in corporate America. And that part of it can be laudable and useful.



But we are developing a system in which unaccountable, unelected individuals who bear little to no consequence for their participation or leadership have become arbiters of justice.



Even in those instances where you may think the mobs’ judgement is right, it may be helpful to think about what the future may hold.



THE RULEBOOK: THIS IS WHAT WE ARE SAYING

“If [foreign powers] see that our national government is efficient and well administered … our people free, contented, and united, they will be much more disposed to cultivate our friendship than provoke our resentment.” – John Jay, Federalist No. 4



TIME OUT: TO BE FAIR

Writer Derek Thompson sings the praises of fair-weather fandom. Atlantic: “Rooting for winners is more than acceptable—it’s commendable. Fans shouldn’t put up with awfully managed teams for decades just because their parents liked those teams, as if sports were governed by the same rules and customs as medieval inheritance. Fans should feel free to shop for teams the way they do for any other product. What I’m proposing here is a theory of fluid fandom that would encourage, as opposed to stigmatize, promiscuous sports allegiances. By permanently anchoring themselves to teams from their hometown or even an adopted town, sports fans consign themselves to needless misery. They also distort the marketplace by sending a signal to team owners that winning is orthogonal to fans’ long-term interests. Fluid fandom, I submit, is the emotionally, civically, and maybe even morally superior way to consume sports. … Whether or not traditionalists approve of it, however, a new age of fandom may be emerging, one that is less arbitrary and shifts the balance of power to fans.”

MCCONNELL KEEPS DEMS OFF CAMPAIGN TRAIL

WashEx: “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., could seek to hold the Senate in session longer each week to keep vulnerable incumbent Democrats off the campaign trail. McConnell this month began threatening Senate Democrats with longer workweeks if they continue to slow-walk the confirmation of President Trump’s nominees. Marc Short, White House point man for legislative affairs, told a small gathering of Republican donors this week that the majority leader plans to use this tactic in the weeks ahead to squeeze Democrats running for re-election in red states. ‘McConnell wants to increase the days the Senate is open for business to keep’ Democratic Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Bill Nelson of Florida, and Claire McCaskill of Missouri ‘tied up from campaigning,’ a Republican donor told the Washington Examiner, relaying what Short communicated. The meeting, organized by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP campaign arm, was not a fundraiser. It was made available to some major Republican donors but no money was solicited in exchange for attending, the contributor said.”



Dem super PAC doing mischief in West Virginia GOP Senate primary - [W. Va.] Metro News: “Booth Goodwin, U.S. Attorney during the federal trial of former coal executive Don Blankenship, is one of the officers of a political action committee taking aim at Blankenship’s Republican primary opponents for U.S. Senate. The ultimate goal of the political action committee is to help out the presumed Democratic nominee, incumbent U.S. Senator Joe Manchin. But the degrees of separation between Goodwin and Blankenship make for a strange bedfellows twist. Contacted this morning and asked to confirm whether he’s the Booth Goodwin listed as treasurer for the Duty and Country PAC, Goodwin responded, ‘Do you know another Booth Goodwin?!’ He then directed questions to Mike Plante, spokesman for the political action committee. Plante said the organization is directing its fire at state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and Congressman Evan Jenkins because they appear to be the front-runners in the Republican primary.”



Poll shows Arizona Senate race turning a shade of blue - OHPI: “The GOP has two U.S. Senate seats at risk this election and Arizona’s Senate seat is one of those two. Democrat front-runner, Kyrsten Sinema, has little to no opposition while the GOP currently has a three-way primary between heavy-hitters Dr. Kelli Ward, former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and Congresswoman Martha McSally. … ‘The issue we are consistently seeing in the numbers is that Democrats are unified, Republicans are less united, and the all-important Independent voters are trending anti-Republican/Trump’ said Mike Noble, managing partner and chief pollster at OH Predictive Insights, a Phoenix-based leading behavioral research polling company. … It is important to bear in mind that our likely General Election survey sample has a Republican +12-point advantage over Democrats. Despite the 12-point GOP advantage in the poll, the President’s favorability is in the red.”



Rokita feels backlash over yard signs sporting Trump, Pence endorsement - AP: “Donald Trump’s re-election campaign has demanded that Rep. Todd Rokita take down yard signs it says give the false impression the president endorsed the Indiana Republican’s Senate bid, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told The Associated Press. The rebuke came after two volunteers who led Trump’s bare-bones 2016 campaign in Vice President Mike Pence’s home state endorsed Rokita during an Indianapolis news conference last week. The Rokita signs, which have gone up since that event, proclaim in large white letters ‘Endorsed by Trump/Pence,’ with smaller letters below adding ‘2016 Indiana Team Leaders.’ Rokita spokesman Nathan Brand refused to say if the campaign will comply with the Trump campaign’s request.”



Billionaire Steyer puts his money on Feinstein’s rival - LAT: “Billionaire California Democratic activist Tom Steyer endorsed state Sen. Kevin de León in his insurgent primary challenge to U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Wednesday, and did not rule out funding an outside effort to boost De León`s chances. ‘I think he`s the kind of young progressive that reflects California and would be a very strong advocate for our state nationally,’ Steyer said, pointing to De León`s efforts on issues such as immigration, climate change and gun control while he was the state Senate leader. ‘I know him well and he`s a friend. We share a lot of values.’”



GOP divided on how to use tax cuts in upcoming races - WaPo: “Heading into a contentious campaign for control of Congress, Republicans are increasingly divided over how to bolster their signature legislative achievement — a $1.5 trillion tax cut — amid signs it is not the political gift they had expected it to be last year. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) aims to pass another massive tax cut this summer, which Republicans hope will rev up the GOP base and improve the standing of Republicans at the polls. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is under pressure to block a vote, which Republican campaign strategists worry could allow red-state Democrats to vote for additional tax cuts and undermine one of the GOP’s most effective lines of attack in conservative-leaning states: that Democrats voted against a big tax cut last December.”



Third party candidate enters Illinois gubernatorial race - Chicago Tribune: “A Downstate Republican state senator launched a third-party bid for governor on Thursday, exacerbating tensions in the party as Gov. Bruce Rauner tries to heal them ahead of November’s contest against Democratic candidate J.B. Pritzker. Sen. Sam McCann of Plainview announced he’ll run under a new Conservative Party label and criticized Rauner in a video for helping Chicago Democrats control the state. In a statement, McCann said ‘the Republican Party under Rauner was unrecognizable to me.’ ‘Rauner has smeared the reputations of proven conservatives and abandoned the principles that millions of Illinois working families hold dear: economic liberty, traditional values, and law and order,’ said McCann, who had previously opted not to seek re-election this year to the seat he was first elected to in 2010.”



Republican candidates could suffer from Trump tariffs - NYT: “Stern warnings are coming from all over the Midwest about the political peril for Republicans in Mr. Trump’s recent course of action, in which the tariffs he slapped on foreign competitors invited retaliatory tariffs on American agriculture. Soybeans are America’s second largest export to China, and that country’s proposed 25 percent duties on the crop would hit hardest in states like Iowa, Kansas and Minnesota — where there are highly competitive House races — as well as Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota, whose Senate contests may determine control of the chamber. … Yet his goal … has effectively prioritized one element of the Trump political coalition over another, larger bloc of voters. That larger segment, the farm belt, is essential to Republican success in the midterm elections and beyond.”



BIPARTISAN GANG HAS VOTES TO FORCE DREAMER VOTE

WSJ: “A bipartisan group of House lawmakers worked Wednesday to exert pressure on House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) to bring immigration legislation up for a vote. Rep. Jeff Denham (R., Calif.) said Wednesday that he had secured the support of 240 lawmakers, including 50 Republicans, for a bipartisan proposal to vote on a series of immigration bills on the House floor. … The broad, bipartisan support for his plan ‘allows us to show the president and the speaker the will of the people, the will of the people’s House,’ [Denham] said. Mr. Denham is hoping to deploy a rarely used procedure known as ‘Queen of the Hill,’ under which the House would vote on a variety of immigration measures and the one with the most votes would pass. The House used this process in 2015 to resolve an internal GOP dispute over a budget resolution.”



Brown readies members of California National Guard on Trump’s dime - LAT: “Gov. Jerry Brown formally mobilized 400 California National Guard members Wednesday for transnational crime-fighting duties, thus preventing any effort by President Trump to have the troops focus on immigration enforcement on the Mexican border. The governor announced that federal officials have agreed to fund the plan he announced last week — a mission to ‘combat criminal gangs, human traffickers and illegal firearm and drug smugglers’ in locations around California, including near the border. The order Brown signed makes clear that the troops will not be allowed to perform a broader set of duties as envisioned by Trump’s recent comments. ‘California National Guard service members shall not engage in any direct law enforcement role nor enforce immigration laws … or support immigration law enforcement activities,’ the order read.”



DOJ RECOMMENDS PROSECUTION FOR MCCABE

Fox News: “The Justice Department’s internal watchdog has sent a criminal referral for fired FBI official Andrew McCabe to the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington. The move follows a recent DOJ inspector general report that found McCabe leaked a self-serving story to the press and later lied about it to then-Director James Comey and federal investigators, prompting Attorney General Jeff Sessions to fire him on March 16. A source confirmed to Fox News that the referral was sent. The Washington Post reported earlier that the IG referred the finding that McCabe misled investigators ‘some time ago,’ asking the top federal prosecutor for D.C. to examine whether he should be charged. Representatives with the Justice Department, inspector general’s office and U.S. attorney’s office all declined to comment. Republican Rep. Mark Meadows backed the move in a tweet Thursday afternoon. ‘The criminal referral from the IG is the right decision. It`s about time we have some accountability for this type of conduct at the Justice Department,’ he said.”



Goodlatte prepares subpoena for Comey memos - The Hill: “The head of the House Judiciary Committee is expected to subpoena the Department of Justice (DOJ) as soon as this week to obtain copies of the so-called Comey memos, The Hill has learned. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) is expected to issue the order in an effort to pressure the agency into granting access so lawmakers can review the seven memos former FBI Director James Comey wrote last year documenting his interactions with President Trump, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The chairman on Wednesday notified the ranking Democrat, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.), that a subpoena is forthcoming. Under Judiciary Committee rules, the chairman must consult the ranking member two business days “before issuing any subpoena” — suggesting that the move is imminent.”



Cohen drops libel suits, shifts focus on recovering documents from FBI raid - Politico: “Embattled attorney Michael Cohen has dropped a pair of much-touted libel suits against BuzzFeed and the private investigation firm Fusion GPS over publication of the so-called dossier detailing alleged ties between President Donald Trump and Russia. Cohen abandoned the suits late Wednesday as he continues to fight to recover documents and electronic files seized from his home, office and hotel room last week by federal authorities as part of what appears to be a broad criminal investigation into his conduct. ‘The decision to voluntarily discontinue these cases was a difficult one,’ Cohen`s attorney David Schwartz said. … The dossier claims that Cohen met with Russian operatives somewhere in Europe, including Prague, to attend a meeting to ‘clean up the mess’ created by public disclosures of other Trump associates’ reported ties to Russia.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Another legal hurdle for Trump - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano breaks down Trump’s attorney-client privilege with Cohen: “The attorney-client privilege protects from scrutiny or revelation the confidential communications of a client to his lawyer that are integral to the lawyer’s legal work for the client. The privilege does not apply to casual conversations between client and lawyer… Now we have a very perilous situation for the president. Records of whatever work Michael Cohen has been doing for him in the past 10 years will soon be in the custody of federal prosecutors who expect it to be evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the president himself. These are the best federal prosecutors in the country. They are civil service-protected and can only be fired for cause, and they have been listening to the president’s phone calls to his confidant and ‘fixer’ and will soon see the fixer’s files.” More here.

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Dear Chris, I have found the Halftime Report to be a sensible alternative to much of the heavy-breathing exaggerations and misinformation that tries to pass as political information and analysis elsewhere. Therefore I was disappointed at your statement ‘That the Republican Party is attacking Comey is not surprising because it is their job to protect the president, even when he is wrong.’ Similarly, you say it is the duty of the Democrats to oppose the president. You appear to be saying political parties have a duty to consider the party affiliation of the president as more important than whether he is right or wrong. This gives your stamp of approval to the hyper partisanship that has made our country so difficult to govern sensibly. To the extent that the leading figures of both parties are elected officials, their clear legal and moral duty should be to do what is right for the country. The parties themselves should see their duty as the higher good of the average citizen, not immediate partisan benefit. If not, why should the average citizen support either of the parties? Please tell me I have misunderstood your comments.” – Paul Wedel, Bangkok, Thailand



[Ed. note: While I certainly take your point, Mr. Wedel, I would offer in my own defense that parties are not people. Republicans and Democrats are not ideological labels nor are they particularly about styles of government. They exist for the purpose of trying to win elections. I pay very little attention to what parties say and view with deep suspicion the positions of rank partisans. Everybody likes the taste of their own home cooking, so I wouldn’t read a review of a restaurant written by the chef. Partisanship is dangerous, but what we are experiencing these days is even worse than partisanship. It’s no less than the cultural balkanization of our nation. We are breaking into clans of such narrow boundaries and fired by such intense antipathies that we can scarcely speak with one another anymore. I personally think that the two party system has served the United States particularly well, forcing the smaller factions into two main rivers of discourse helps keep crazy people in check and acts as a bulwark against demagogues. The purpose of all those primaries and conventions and debates and so on is to create barriers of entry for people running for office. Parties at times have failed in this work but have succeeded more often than not. In fact, I would argue that one of the most disheartening trends in politics today are the weakening of the parties. Campaign finance laws and a reassertion of populist sentiment have conspired to make the Republican and Democratic parties hollowed out shells of their former selves. I think the country was better off when we were more partisan and less clannish.]

The Scottish Sun: “A driver whose parked car ‘blocked a gate’ returned to find her motor had been attacked with baked beans. The woman, who wants to be known only as Emma, said her car was vandalised while left in a car park at submarine makers BAE in Barrow, Cumbria. The single mother also found a note attached to her windscreen which said: ‘Wake up earlier.’ Emma, 30, took pictures of the bean attack and note and posted them to social media. The angry message warned: ‘This is not a parking space. People need regular access to these back gates and you’re stopping them!’ … Emma wrote on social media: ‘So I got back to my car today to this – I wouldn’t mind but I asked someone if it was OK to park where I was they said it would be fine and I was by no means blocking any gate!’ … A spokesman for Cumbria Police said the incident had not been reported to police.”

"Republicans hope that four primaries in the coming weeks will yield the kind of top-tier candidates good enough to beat at least a couple vulnerable-but-seasoned Democratic incumbents and solidify the GOP’s Senate majority. But outsider candidates and negative campaigns in two high-value targets -- Indiana and West Virginia -- threaten to foil GOP plans.

West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin has been a top GOP target since at least Nov. 2016 -- when Republican Donald Trump won the state with 68.7 percent of the vote.

Many voters have said they were resentful about what they called the Obama administration’s “war on coal.” But Manchin, a former West Virginia governor seeking a second full term, understands how a Democrat can win a state that has voted for Republicans in the past five presidential elections.

The 70-year-old Manchin largely opposed Obama’s energy agenda and has supported gun rights. And more recently -- just last week -- his vote helped Mike Pompeo get confirmed as Trump’s picked for secretary of State. But Manchin also voted last year against Trump and congressional Republicans’ ObamaCare repeal bill and their December 2017 tax plan.

Still, the GOP’s chances of defeating Manchin are being confounded by primary candidate Don Blankenship, a former coal mining executive released from prison less than a year ago.

Blankenship led the company that owned the Upper Big Branch mine, where 29 men were killed in a 2010 explosion. He was sentenced to a year in prison for conspiring to break safety laws, a misdemeanor.

While Blankenship`s bid is a long shot, he`s testing whether a party led by an anti-establishment outsider can rein in its anti-establishment impulses.

""The establishment, no matter who you define it as, has not been creating jobs in West Virginia,"" he said at a recent primary debate.

Even before Blankenship emerged as a legitimate Republican candidate, West Virginia was a worry for some Republicans.

Manchin’s efforts to craft a bipartisan brand sparked talk that Trump might endorse him.

Winning in West Virginia has become increasingly important in recent months to Republicans, who have just a two-seat Senate majority that now seems less secure given signs of Democratic momentum in Nevada, Arizona, Tennessee and elsewhere.

And, if Democrats win West Virginia, they may have a slim chance at seizing the Senate majority.

Some of Trump`s most prominent conservative supporters have rallied behind state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a former Capitol Hill aide who was raised in New Jersey but has served as West Virginia`s top lawyer since 2013.

Rep. Evan Jenkins, a former Democrat, has highlighted his West Virginia roots and deep allegiance to Trump. Jenkins noted that Manchin missed a big chance to align himself with Trump on taxes and health care.

""The president gave Joe Manchin every opportunity in the early weeks and months of his administration to vote the right way,"" Jenkins said in an interview. ""He voted wrong.""

A Fox News poll released April 22 shows Jenkins holding 25 percent of the vote among likely West Virginia GOP Senate primary voters, with Morrisey getting 21 percent and Blankenship getting 16 percent. Jenkins’ lead over Morrisey is within the poll’s margin of sampling error.

Primary voters head to the polls on May 8, the same day for the primaries in Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina.

Blankenship’s supervised prison release was transferred last August to federal officials in Nevada, where he has a six-bedroom home outside of Las Vegas.

And, he recently drew attention for comments about the father of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

Blankenship said he believed McConnell has a conflict of interest in foreign-relations matters, in particular those dealing with China. Chao`s father was born in China and started an international shipping company in New York.

""I don`t have any problem with Chinese people,"" Blankenship told the radio station. ""But I have an issue when the father-in-law is a wealthy China-person and there`s a lot of connections with some of the brass, if you will, in China.""

In Indiana, the grueling Republican Senate race has been dubbed the nation`s nastiest primary.

Two sitting congressmen and a former state lawmaker are battling to replace Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly in November.

They`ve tried to appeal to Trump voters by adopting the president`s harsh immigration rhetoric and penchant for personal insults. The candidates have even channeled Trump by assigning derisive nicknames to one another: ""Lyin`"" Todd Rokita, ""Tax Hike"" Mike Braun and Luke ""Missing"" Messer.

As the bitter campaign slogs on, some Republicans worry the primary winner could emerge so wounded it could risk the party`s chances of taking down one of the Senate`s most vulnerable Democrats.

""This race has slowly but surely descended into Dante`s Inferno,"" said John Hammond III, who represents Indiana on the Republican National Committee. ""It will provide the Democrats an awful lot of free opposition research.""

Rokita`s campaign on Wednesday even released a children`s book ridiculing Messer for moving out of Indiana after his election to Congress.

""We`ve checked stores, farms and searched nearby canals. He`s probably home in Virginia with his insider pals,"" reads one passage.

Rollicking debates have taken on a reality-TV aura as the candidates have torn into one another. Out-of-state living arrangements, questionable uses of tax dollars, drunken-driving convictions, voting histories and ethical transgressions -- all dredged up in news stories -- have provided grist for the attacks.

But with few major policy differences, they don`t have much else to contrast.

""It`s a continued race to the bottom,"" Indiana Democratic Party Chairman John Zody said. ""These guys are so alike on policy that the only way they can differentiate themselves is by attacking each other.""

Democrats have egged on Republicans, hoping any damage they`d inflict would help Donnelly, who has spent recent months fundraising and flying under the radar.

Throughout, the GOP candidates have fallen over each other to profess their admiration for Trump, who won the state by 19 points.

Rokita, a three-term congressman, dons a red ""Make America Great Again"" hat in TV ads and carries a cardboard Trump cutout to rallies. Messer, who is in House leadership, recently suggested Trump ought to win the Nobel Peace Prize. And Braun, a businessman and former state lawmaker, argues his experience makes him even more Trumpian because he`s an outsider.

Former aides have reported that Rokita berated staffers to tears, docked pay for minor mistakes and forced them to undertake demeaning tasks, like cleaning his car after a campaign driver had body odor.

He also drew scrutiny for spending $3 million in public money on self-promotion, and for doing political work on government time as Indiana`s secretary of state -- a likely ethics violation.

In Ohio, the favorite in the GOP primary appears to be Rep. Jim Renacci, whom Trump recently endorsed.

He tweeted that Renacci has “worked so hard on tax reductions, illegal immigration, the border and crime. I need Jim very badly to help our agenda and to keep making America great again! He will be a fantastic senator for the great state of Ohio, and has my full endorsement!”

Renacci entered the race earlier this year after state Treasurer Josh Mandel dropped out because of a family health issue. He faces businessman Mike Gibbons. Trump won the swing state in 2016. But the GOP primary winner will likely have a difficult time defeating two-term Democratic candidate Sherrod Brown.

A RealClearPolitics poll has a potential matchup between Renacci and Brown “lean Democrat.”

"All public schools in West Virginia were shuttered Thursday as teachers geared up to strike for better wages and health insurance options -- even as Gov. Jim Justice signed a bill to raise teacher pay.

Still, dozens of teachers were gathering outside schools Thursday, ready to travel to Charleston, WV, to attend a rally outside of the capitol building, WSAZ reported.

On the eve of the impending strike, Justice, a Republican, signed a bill into law that would raise pay for teachers and state employees. The employees will receive a two percent raise in the upcoming year and a one percent raise next year, according to the Charleston Gazette-Mail.

WEST VIRGINIA WOMAN DRAGGED OUT OF CAPITOL FOR READING LIST OF CORPORATE DONORS

Justice said it`s important to keep both teachers and kids in the classroom.

“We certainly recognize our teachers are underpaid and this is a step in the right direction to addressing their pay issue. The PEIA [finance] board has also voted to approve changes I recommended,"" Justice said in a statement. ""I’ve asked and the PEIA board has voted to eliminate the mandated participation in the Go365 program, the use of combined household income to determine rates, and to freeze the plan for 16 months while we examine it and enact a long-term solution to the PEIA problems.""

The state’s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, wrote in a statement the “impending work stoppage is unlawful.”

“State law and court rulings give specific parties avenues to remedy such illegal conduct, including the option to seek an injunction to end an unlawful strike,” Morrisey said. “This illegal work stoppage affects hundreds of thousands of students and families across our state. Our office is prepared to support any relevant state agency or board with legal remedies they may choose to pursue to uphold the law. We also stand ready to assist and support any county board of education or county superintendent as they enforce the law.""

According to the National Education Association, West Virginia teachers earn an average salary of $45,622, which ranks 48th among the states. The national average is $58,353.

As a Democrat from a state where President Trump walloped Hillary Clinton by nearly 42 points in the 2016 election, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) was largely seen inside the Beltway as one of the most vulnerable senators entering the 2018 midterms. That’s apparently how Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) read the situation.

In a scene recounted in former White House staffer Cliff Sims’s new book, “Team of Vipers: My 500 Extraordinary Days in the Trump White House,” McConnell reportedly told Trump in February 2017 that Manchin was in his crosshairs.

“We’re going to do everything in our power to beat him when he comes up for reelection,” McConnell told the president, according to Sims. “We’re going to crush him like a grape.”

Manchin, however, defied the odds, beating his GOP opponent last November by about three points. With the release of Sims’s book this week, the senator used the revelation of McConnell’s supposed comment as an opportunity for some political trolling. (McConnell hasn’t commented on the veracity of Sims’s account.)

On Thursday afternoon, Manchin posted a picture of himself holding a jar of Woodbine Jams & Jellies, an all-natural small-batch jam company founded 14 years ago by two women in Richwood W.Va.

“I heard @senatemajldr wanted some #WV crushed grapes,” Manchin wrote on Twitter, ""so I dropped some off at his office today.”

I heard @senatemajldr wanted some #WV crushed grapes, so I dropped some off at his office today. pic.twitter.com/jvp2IDfOwl — Senator Joe Manchin (@Sen_JoeManchin) January 31, 2019

This is actually not the first time U.S. Senate politics in West Virginia have been punctuated with a social-media clap back — and it was McConnell who landed the decisive digital blow last time.

In last year’s Republican primary to see who would challenge Manchin, the most controversial and vocal candidate in the race was Don Blankenship. A former coal-mining executive who spent a year in prison following a deadly 2010 mine explosion, his campaign rhetoric featured nasty personal attacks on McConnell, including talk about the “China people” behind the Senate majority leader, a reference to his wife’s family. Blankenship also peddled a story about how a boat owned by a shipping company owned by McConnell’s father-in-law was intercepted going from Colombia to Europe with $7 million in cocaine on board.

Stretching the story, Blankenship’s campaign began referring to the majority leader as “Cocaine Mitch.”

McConnell’s own campaign had the perfect response after Blankenship finished third in the primary, losing out to the Kentucky senator’s own preferred candidate, state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.

On the night of Blankenship’s loss, the Twitter account for McConnell’s campaign posted a photoshopped image of promotional art originally used for Netflix’s drug-smuggling series “Narcos.” The original image showed the actor who plays drug lord Pablo Escobar surrounded by white powder — presumably cocaine.

McConnell’s account simply photoshopped the senator’s face onto Escobar’s body to go along with some choice words.

"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump uttered a dizzying number of false statements in his epically long weekend speech, to an audience that didn’t seem to mind at all.

He got the unemployment rate wrong. He misstated his winning margin in the election. He reprised some of his most frequently told fictions and dusted off old ones, even going back to the size of his inauguration crowd.

A look at some of his words in his two-hour-plus speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday:

UNEMPLOYMENT

TRUMP: “We’re down to 3.7 percent unemployment, the lowest number in a long time.”

THE FACTS: The unemployment rate is 4 percent. It was 3.7 percent in September.

DIVERSITY VISAS

TRUMP: On the diversity visa lottery program: “They send us the people they don’t want.”

THE FACTS: A persistent falsehood. “They,” meaning other countries, do not select citizens for the U.S. program. Foreigners decide on their own to apply for it. They must meet education or skills benchmarks to apply and those who are tentatively selected through the lottery must pass background checks before being confirmed.

Trump attributed similar characteristics to migrant caravans from Central America, suggesting governments try to get rid of their bad people by putting them in caravans for the U.S. Again, migrants are self-selected, not told to march to the U.S.

RUSSIA INVESTIGATION

TRUMP: Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigative team has “13 of the angriest Democrats in the history of our country.”

THE FACTS: Mueller is a longtime Republican and party affiliation cuts both ways — or no way at all — in the varied background of the team. Some have donated campaign money to Democrats. The team is not known to be particularly or historically angry.

CROWD SIZE

TRUMP on what he considers false reporting about his crowd sizes: “They did the same thing at our big inauguration speech. You take a look at those crowds. …We had a crowd, I’ve never seen anything like it. … There were people (from) the Capitol down to the Washington Monument.”

THE FACTS: The National Park Service released dozens of photos of the crowd gathered for his inauguration ceremony and it was clear from them that crowds did not extend to the Washington Monument from the Capitol. Large swaths of empty space were visible on the National Mall.

The park service also released photos from President Barack Obama’s two inaugurations, showing that his 2009 event far outstripped the number of people who attended Trump’s inauguration.

It released the photos in response to news media requests made through the Freedom of Information Act after Trump and his aides accused news organizations of framing or timing photos and video to make it look like not many people came.

JAMES COMEY

TRUMP: “Every single Democrat said Comey should be fired” for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails late in the campaign. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer “called for his resignation many times.”

THE FACTS: Not true. Democrats did not universally — or even broadly — call for Comey to be fired despite their anger over his decision to go public before Election Day with news that the FBI had renewed its investigation of Clinton’s handling of her emails. Several Democratic lawmakers did want him out, but they were a distinct minority.

Schumer said he had lost confidence in Comey but did not urge his removal, telling Bloomberg News he wanted to speak with the FBI chief “to restore my faith.” The House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, also held off on asking for Comey to step down, while musing: “Maybe he’s not in the right job.” Trump fired him months later.

GREEN NEW DEAL

TRUMP: “No planes, no energy. …Perhaps nothing is more extreme than the Democrats’ plan to completely take over American energy, and completely destroy America’s economy through their new $100 trillion dollar Green New Deal. …It would end air travel.”

THE FACTS: He’s ignoring the actual provisions of the plan, which would not ban air travel or end traditional sources of energy. The plan, backed by some liberal Democrats but greeted cautiously or opposed by others in the party, does call for a drastic drop in greenhouse-gas emissions from fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas.

Trump is extrapolating from a fact sheet that initially accompanied the plan, then was disavowed and withdrawn by its sponsors. It proposed building high-speed rail at a scale “where air travel stops becoming necessary.”

2016 ELECTION

TRUMP, on his Electoral College win: “We didn’t get to 270. We got 306.”

THE FACTS: Trump misstates the Electoral College vote in his 2016 presidential race against Democrat Hillary Clinton. The official count was 304 to 227, according to an Associated Press tally of the electoral votes in every state.

CHINA-TRADE

TRUMP: “We’ve lost so much money with China — $500 billion a year. And on trade, it’s such a disaster. It’s $507 billion a year. China — just one country. We lose with everybody, almost. But China is one country — $507 billion, for many years.”

THE FACTS: He’s off by several hundred billion dollars on the trade deficit with China . Trump typically ignores one part of a trading relationship, services, and considers only the other part, goods. Even by that measure, he’s wrong. On goods alone, the U.S. ran a trade deficit of $382 billion with China last year, not $507 billion. That was up from nearly $376 billion in 2017.

The U.S. is strong on services and ran a $40 billion surplus with China on that form of trade in 2017. So the actual trade deficit with China that year was $335 billon.

HEALTH CARE

TRUMP: “We have some great private coverage. And we have initiated some incredible plans, like the new cooperative plan, where you get better insurance than Obamacare for a fraction of the cost.”

THE FACTS: He’s glossing over the limitations of his administration’s expanded health care options , which involve both short term and association plans. They offer lower premiums than comprehensive plans such as those under the Affordable Care Act but cover less.

Short-term plans don’t have to take people with medical conditions or provide benefits such as coverage for maternity, mental health, prescription drugs and substance abuse treatment. Association health plans do have to accept people with pre-existing medical conditions, but they don’t have to cover the full menu of 10 “essential” kinds of benefits required by Obamacare.

Gary Claxton of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation says short-term plans may turn out to be more costly than Trump administration officials suggest. The plans now cover up to 90 days, but if insurers expand them to offer up to 36 months’ coverage, the companies will be taking on more risk. “You’ll have to pay more up front because there’s a longer time during which you could get sick,” he said.

MIDTERM ELECTIONS

TRUMP: “We were given no credit. I can’t go and campaign for all of the people in the House. There’s too many.”

TRUMP, on his endorsement of Florida candidate for governor, Ron DeSantis: “I said, ‘Ron, Don’t make me do this, Ron.’ ‘Sir, I can win.’ Alright, Ron, here we go. Because I know if he loses — which almost never happens when I endorse someone, almost never. Only one time, that was because it was done in the middle of the day of the election… But we very rarely lose.”

THE FACTS: Trump is wrong to suggest that almost every candidate he endorsed and campaigned for in the November midterm elections — except for perhaps one — won.

Two Republicans whom Trump strongly backed in their Senate races — Montana’s Matt Rosendale and West Virginia’s Patrick Morrisey — lost to Democratic Sens. Jon Tester and Joe Manchin, respectively. Trump had visited Montana four times and West Virginia three times to rally voters. Trump also campaigned for two other Senate losers: incumbent Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada and Leah Vukmir in Wisconsin.

In the House, Republican Rep. Jason Lewis lost his race in Minnesota to Democrat Angie Craig, whom he had defeated by 2 percentage points in 2016. Trump endorsed Lewis and campaigned for him.

VETERANS

TRUMP, on the Choice program for veterans: “I got that approved after 44 years of being unable to get it approved for our veterans.”

THE FACTS: False. Congress approved the private-sector Veterans Choice health program in 2014 and President Barack Obama signed it into law. Trump is expanding it .

TRUMP: “We are taking care of our veterans like they have never been taken care of before. We just got them Choice so they can now go see a doctor. Now they can go see a doctor instead of waiting on line for weeks and weeks and weeks.”

THE FACTS: Veterans still must wait for weeks.

While it’s true the VA recently announced plans to expand eligibility for veterans in the Veterans Choice program, it remains limited due in part to uncertain money and longer waits.

The program currently allows veterans to see doctors outside the VA system if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles to a VA facility. Under new rules to take effect in June, veterans will have that option for a private doctor if their VA wait is only 20 days (28 for specialty care) or their drive is only 30 minutes.

But the expanded Choice eligibility may do little to provide immediate help.

That’s because veterans often must wait even longer for an appointment in the private sector. Last year, then-Secretary David Shulkin said VA care is “often 40 percent better in terms of wait times” compared with the private sector. In 2018, 34 percent of all VA appointments were with outside physicians, down from 36 percent in 2017.

Choice came into effect after some veterans died while waiting months for appointments at the Phoenix VA medical center.

SHUTDOWN

TRUMP: “I flew to Iraq — the first time I left the White House, because I stayed at the White House for months and months because I wanted the Democrats to get back from their vacations from Hawaii and these other places.”

THE FACTS: Trump actually left the White House plenty of times during the “months and months” surrounding the partial government shutdown that began Dec. 22.

Besides his trip to Iraq and Germany on Dec. 26-27, Trump traveled to the Mexican border town of McAllen, Texas, on Jan. 10. On Jan. 14, he also went to New Orleans to address the American Farm Bureau. He’s left the White House during the five-week shutdown for meetings at Camp David and the Capitol.

Shortly before the shutdown began, he traveled to Philadelphia to watch the Army-Navy football game (Dec. 8), visited Kansas City for a law enforcement conference (Dec. 7), attended former President George H.W. Bush’s funeral at the Washington National Cathedral (Dec. 5), participated in the G-20 summit in Argentina in late November; and hosted “Make America Great Again” rallies in Mississippi with Senate candidate Cindy Hyde-Smith (Nov. 26). He hosted a dinner on Thanksgiving at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

"CLOSE Cardinals attending Pope Francis` summit on preventing clergy sex abuse have called for a new culture of accountability in the Catholic Church to punish bishops and religious superiors who fail to protect their flocks from predator priests. (Feb. 22) AP

West Virginia`s attorney general filed a lawsuit Tuesday against a retired Catholic bishop and a diocese alleging that they knowingly employing pedophile priests and failed to conduct adequate background checks.

Attorney General Patrick Morrisey`s suit follows the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston`s disclosure last November of 18 priests who were credibly accused of having sexually abused children over a span from 1950 through last summer and another 13 who were accused in other states and then came to West Virginia, though no complaints were lodged against them there.

""The diocese and its bishops chose to cover up and conceal arguably criminal behavior of admitted child sex abusers,"" the lawsuit says.

In response, the diocese issued a statement saying it ""strongly and unconditionally rejects"" the lawsuit`s claim that it isn`t committed to protecting children. It said that it now has a zero-tolerance policy against abuse by a priest or any employee or volunteer.

The diocese said that some of the allegations in the lawsuit are more than 50 years old and are not accurately described.

In September, the diocese announced Bishop Michael Bransfield`s retirement and said he had been under investigation over allegations of sexual harassment of adults and financial improprieties. A team of investigators had interviewed 40 people over four months and delivered its findings to the Vatican, the diocese said.

The lawsuit focuses on the threat to children in alleging that the diocese broke the state`s consumer-protection laws by failing to shield kids from pedophile priests. The suit asks for restitution and civil penalties for violations of the state law.

“Our investigation reveals a serious need for the diocese to enact policy changes that will better protect children, just as this lawsuit demonstrates our resolve to pursue every avenue to effectuate change as no one is above the law,” Morrisey said in a statement.

As an example of how the diocese ignored child sex abusers, the lawsuit cites a priest, Patrick Condron, who worked at St. Joseph Preparatory Seminary High School in Vienna, West Virginia, from 1980 to 1987. It says Condron admitted to allegations of abuse, including long kisses and an attempt at intercourse.

Yet after sending Condron to treatment facilities in New Mexico and Missouri, he was returned to work at Wheeling Catholic Elementary School from 1998 to 2001, according to the suit.

In another case, the diocese was aware that a priest named Victor Frobas had been accused of sexually abusing a child in 1962 but was hired to work in West Virginia anyway starting in 1965. He was accused of molesting kids while director of a Catholic summer youth program, Camp Tygart, where he worked through 1976.

After treatment, he returned to Wheeling as a Catholic high-school chaplain but was given another leave of absence after allegations again were lodged, the suit says. In 1987, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years in prison for inappropriate contact with two children in St. Louis.

West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey sued the Catholic diocese of Wheeling-Charleston and its former bishop Michael J. Bransfield on Tuesday, charging that they “knowingly employed pedophiles and failed to conduct adequate background checks” for people working in Catholic schools and camps, a news release from Morrisey’s office says.

The lawsuit, the latest dramatic civil action against the American church in the past year, alleges violations of the state’s consumer protection laws. It accuses the diocese of advertising safe environments for children while at the same time, the complaint says, choosing “to cover up and conceal arguably criminal behavior of child sexual abuse.”

Some child abuse experts said the move was precedent-setting, both in terms of targeting an entire diocese rather than individual priests, and by using consumer law to launch a civil lawsuit which could unlock the church’s files through legal discovery. The West Virginia attorney general used the consumer fraud strategy because, as with attorneys general in other states, he is not empowered to launch a criminal grand jury investigation.

“This is the most that we’ve seen so far in terms of prosecution, in terms of someone in the higher levels of the hierarchy. This is the first time we’ve seen a comprehensive claim against a whole diocese and a bishop,"" said Marci Hamilton, a law scholar and head of Child USA, a nonprofit organization focused on child abuse.

[The Pennsylvania report on clergy sex abuse spawned investigations nationwide. Now what?]

Charles E. Zech, of the Center for the Study of Church Management at Villanova University, called the lawsuit “the logical next step"" after last summer’s release of an explosive grand jury report in Pennsylvania describing abuse and cover-ups across the state in past decades.

“The consumer fraud is just to get the foot in the door,"" Zech said. ""And then you can open up all kinds of avenues, once you’ve established that. The diocese is unwilling to provide it, this is the only way to do it.”

The Wheeling-Charleston Diocese, which covers the entire state, issued a statement Tuesday which said it “strongly and unconditionally rejects the Complaint’s assertion that the Diocese is not wholly committed to the protection of children.” The statement said the lawsuit was based in part on information provided by the church both publicly and to the attorney general in recent months, that some allegations “occurred more than 50 years ago and some are not accurately described.”

Bransfield, the only bishop named as a defendant in the suit, could not be reached for comment.

Although Catholic officials and leaders have conceded that the Church failed in the past, some consider the recent criticism unfair for an institution that has invested many millions in child protection efforts. One church official who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to appear to be defending past behavior, called the new suit a “publicity stunt,” noting that policies have changed significantly in recent decades.

Civil authorities in the past year have initiated several actions against the Catholic Church on sex abuse that are new in the United States, where the church is the largest single faith group and, survivor advocates say, has been shielded for many years by insufficiently critical law enforcement, prosecutors and the news media. Last fall, following the release of the Pennsylvania grand jury report, the Justice Department opened its own investigation of alleged sexual abuse of children by Catholic clergy members across the state.

[More U.S. Catholics are considering leaving the church over sex abuse, poll says]

West Virginia launched its investigation last fall after Pennsylvania’s report disclosed that some of the priests there also had worked in West Virginia, the new lawsuit states, and filed subpoenas to the diocese which did not result in full disclosure. Morrisey said in an interview that he has been communicating with people working on the sex abuse issue in other states since priests have crossed state lines, and he decided it was best to file the lawsuit under consumer protection laws. Pennsylvania officials said 16 attorneys general have publicly revealed investigations of the Catholic church since the Pennsylvania grand jury report was issued.

""If we didn’t engage in this action, there would be no statewide review that would occur,"" he said. ""The state doesn’t have the structure to do what Pennsylvania did because it doesn’t have the criminal jurisdiction.""

The lawsuit is seeking a permanent court order “blocking the diocese from continuation of any such conduct,” as well as possible restitution and civil penalties. Morrisey said he is hopeful that more people will come forward and that the lawsuit could be amended to include more examples.

“I’m pleased to see Attorney General Morrisey taking such an innovative approach to protecting children in West Virginia,” Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said.

Advocates for the abused have cheered what they consider a late entry of top civil officials, as other countries — including Australia, Canada and Germany — have run nationwide investigations of clergy sex abuse and coverups. Many Catholic leaders have been apologetic and said they were cooperating with needed investigations; others have painted the push as anti-Catholic and unfairly targeting one community for the societal problem of child sexual abuse.

The West Virginia news comes a week after Baltimore Archbishop William Lori — whom the pope appointed last fall to investigate allegations including that Bransfield had sexually harassed adults — barred Bransfield from any priestly duties. Lori said on March 11 that his preliminary investigation, which involved five lay experts, was being forwarded to the Vatican for a final judgment.

That inquiry was looking into allegations of sexual harassment of adults and financial improprieties.

Morrisey said the U.S. church’s investigation into Bransfield was sent to the Vatican without the state being allowed to review any files. By filing this lawsuit, he said, he wants the church to become more transparent.

""There’s still a culture of secrecy,"" he said. ""The church needs to come clean.""

Morrisey also wants the diocese to have abuse allegations reviewed by third parties, not just a diocese lawyer. And, he said, he wants background checks done by independent services.

“We have reason to believe the systems in place are still inadequate,” he said.

The two counts of the lawsuit are filed under West Virginia’s consumer protection law. The first count alleges the church failed to deliver the advertised service of “providing a safe learning environment” and the second count claims the church failed to “warn of dangerous services,” by employing priests the diocese knew had been credibly accused of abuse “and intentionally failed to warn the purchasers of educational and recreational services.” The church claims to have the eighth largest school system in West Virginia by number of schools, with six high schools and 19 elementary schools.

The alleged pattern of failures by the diocese dates to as early as 1965, the lawsuit states, when the church hired a priest from Philadelphia it knew had been credibly accused of sexually abusing a child. That priest, Victor Frobas, “was moved frequently” due to allegations of sexually abusing children, and in 1972 became director of Camp Tygart, now known as Camp Bosco, the lawsuit states, before he was removed and sent to a home in Massachusetts for treatment of pedophilia. But he returned to West Virginia in 1976 and served as the chaplain at Wheeling Central Catholic High School, then took another leave after more allegations of abuse. He wound up in St. Louis, where he was convicted in 1987 of inappropriate conduct with minors and sentenced to five years in prison, the lawsuit states. Frobas died in 1993.

In another case, the complaint alleges that the diocese hired a lay teacher to work at a high school in Weirton, W. Va., in 2011 but didn’t do a background check on him. Two years later, the diocese found that the man, Ronald Cooper, was a convicted rapist in Washington state. He was fired, but the diocese didn’t disclose that it had “employed a person convicted of sexual abuse of a child,” the lawsuit states.

[In major shift, lay Catholics are organizing to push bishops on reform. And sometimes priests join in]

“Another priest admitted on his employment application to having been accused of child sexual abuse decades earlier, yet the civil complaint alleges the diocese passed on the opportunity to thoroughly vet the priest and adequately check his background. Instead, the diocese and two bishops employed the priest for approximately four years at a parish that operates an elementary school,” the attorney general’s news release says but doesn’t specify when.

Judy Block Jones, Midwest regional leader for the advocacy group Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, said West Virginia fosters a tight-knight atmosphere where victims seem more afraid to come out than in other states where she spends her time.

“It’s hard to get outside law enforcement involved in anything with the Catholic sex abuse crisis,” she said. “Now they’re starting to listen.”", West Virginia accuses Catholic diocese and former bishops of sex abuse cover-up in unusual consumer protection lawsuit ,3-2019
"(CNN) West Virginia`s attorney general has sued the state`s diocese and former bishop, saying they ""knowingly employed pedophiles"" while failing to alert parents about potential risks at Catholic schools and other activities.

""Parents who pay and entrust the Wheeling-Charleston diocese and its schools to educate and care for their children deserve full transparency,"" Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said in a statement.

""Our investigation reveals a serious need for the diocese to enact policy changes that will better protect children, just as this lawsuit demonstrates our resolve to pursue every avenue to effectuate change as no one is above the law.""

In the lawsuit filed Tuesday, Morrisey said he opened an investigation last fall after a grand jury in Pennsylvania found evidence that more than 300 Catholic priests had abused children in that state since the 1950s. Most of the accusations dated to before 2002, when many Catholic dioceses in the United States instituted new child safety protocols.

CNN reached out to the Diocese of Charleston-Wheeling, the state`s only Roman Catholic diocese, but did not receive an immediate response.

"CHARLESTON, W.Va. - (AP) -- West Virginia has reached a $37 million settlement with the drug distributor McKesson in a lawsuit accusing the company of shipping millions of suspicious painkiller orders to the state as it was being ravaged by the opioid epidemic.

A Thursday news release from Gov. Jim Justice and Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said the payment is thought to be the country`s largest state settlement against a single pharmaceutical distributor. However, U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin criticized the settlement, suggesting it went easy on McKesson.

It`s one of many settlements with the drug industry in West Virginia, which has the nation`s highest opioid overdose rate. The state has received about $84 million through settlements with companies in lawsuits stemming from the national opioid crisis, according to the attorney general`s office.

The McKesson case, filed in 2016 in a West Virginia circuit court, alleged that the company flooded counties in the state with large amounts of opioids without efforts to prevent illegal diversion of the drugs.

In one example from the suit, McKesson sent about 1.4 million opioids to Grant County between 2007 and 2012 -- enough to provide every man, woman and child there with 118 painkillers.

McKesson issued a statement denying wrongdoing and says it is committed to ending the opioid epidemic.

""McKesson is committed to working with others to end this national crisis, however, and is pleased that the settlement provides funding toward initiatives intended to address the opioid epidemic,"" the statement said.

Manchin slammed the settlement in a statement after it was announced, calling it a ""sweetheart deal"" for McKesson.

""The governor and attorney general either don`t know how to negotiate, don`t understand the scope of this problem or don`t care about the impact this epidemic has had on the state of West Virginia,"" said Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, who noted that McKesson made more than $208 billion last year. ""Either way, they have failed our state.""

Justice, a Republican, told reporters Thursday that he wanted to get more money from McKesson but was told that $37 million was ""the absolute best we`re going to do.""

In 2017, McKesson agreed to pay a $150 million civil penalty for allegedly failing to report and fulfilling suspicious orders for drugs placed by pharmacies, including many in West Virginia, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

""The abuse of prescription drugs has rampantly spread throughout our communities,"" said Karl C. Colder, then the DEA`s Special Agent in Charge in Washington, when announcing the 2017 penalty. ""This abuse has directly resulted in the escalation of heroin addiction and related overdoses.""

In 2008, the company agreed to a $13.25 million civil penalty for similar violations.

Hospitals in West Virginia have also recently taken steps to hold the drug industry accountable for the opioid crisis.

Nearly 30 hospitals in West Virginia and 10 of their affiliates in Kentucky banded together earlier this week to sue some of the country`s largest opioid companies, saying they inundated Appalachia with powerful painkillers and forced medical centers to deal with the financial repercussions. The case is thought to be the first time a large group of hospitals in a state has teamed up to take legal action against opioid firms, according to the attorney representing the hospitals.

About 2,000 lawsuits have been filed nationwide against the drug industry over the opioid crisis by state and local governments, American Indian tribes, unions, hospitals and others.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says opioids were involved in nearly 48,000 deaths in 2017.", West Virginia settles opioid lawsuit with McKesson for $37M ,5-2019
"West Virginia and drug distributor McKesson Corp. announced a $37 million settlement of a lawsuit over the company’s role in the opioid epidemic Thursday, a record agreement for the state that leads the nation in drug overdose deaths.

McKesson, the sixth-largest company on the Fortune 500 list, admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to pay $14.5 million this year and $4.5 million annually for five years. The money will go toward state efforts to address the opioid crisis, including rehabilitation, job training and mental health programs, the company said in a statement.

The payment is the largest from any of 13 pharmaceutical wholesalers the state has been pursuing legally for years. It pushes the total recouped to $84 million, which includes previous settlements with Cardinal Health ($20 million) and AmerisourceBergen ($16 million), according to Gov. Jim Justice (R).

Those companies and McKesson control nearly 90 percent of the distribution of legal painkillers in the United States.

In 2017, McKesson agreed to pay $150 million in a record-setting settlement of charges brought by federal authorities. Last year the company pledged $100 million toward fighting the opioid crisis.

In a separate criminal case Thursday, a federal jury in Boston convicted five executives of Insys Therapeutics, including company founder John Kapoor, of racketeering charges for bribing doctors to unnecessarily prescribe the company’s powerful fentanyl spray.

The trial brought out evidence that the company paid doctors sham speaking fees and that in one case, an exotic dancer-turned-company executive gave a doctor a lap dance to encourage him to prescribe the spray, Subsys, which is used for pain suffered by cancer patients. The woman, Sunrise Lee, was among the people convicted Thursday.

Criminal charges against drug company management are rare. But last month, federal prosecutors in New York accused two executives of the nation’s sixth-largest drug distributor, Rochester Drug Cooperative, of charges that include conspiring to distribute narcotics for nonmedical reasons. The men, one of whom has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with authorities, could face 10 years to life in prison.

Hundreds of states, counties, cities and Native American tribes have filed civil suits against drug distributors, manufacturers and pharmacy chains, hoping to win compensation for the costs of grappling with the two-decade-old drug crisis.

In a closely watched state case, Oklahoma settled in March with Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, for $270 million and is scheduled to go to trial against Johnson & Johnson and Teva Pharmaceuticals May 28.

Federal law makes distributors — which ship drugs from manufacturers to drugstores, hospitals, nursing homes and elsewhere — responsible for spotting unusual amounts, patterns or frequency of narcotic sales, which can indicate that drugs are being diverted to the black market.

McKesson distributed nearly 100 million doses of oxycodone and hydrocodone in West Virginia — home to 1.8 million people — between 2007 and 2012, the state charged. That included, for example, 1.3 million doses in Boone County, where 24,629 people lived in 201o.

In 2017, West Virginia led the nation with 57.8 drug overdose deaths per 100,000 residents, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 400,000 people in the United States have died of overdoses to prescription drugs, heroin and illegal fentanyl between 1999 and 2017.

West Virginia’s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, said in a statement that his department “has done as much or more than any office in the country to fight this terrible epidemic, fix the failed policies of the past and bring accountability to the system.” The number of pills coming into the state has declined 35 percent since he took office in 2013, he said.

"CHARLESTON, W.Va. - (AP) -- Elizabeth Warren is set to visit a state that hasn`t been friendly to Democrats lately to pitch her plan to combat the opioid addiction crisis by boosting taxes on the wealthy.

The Massachusetts senator and Democratic presidential candidate will travel to Kermit, West Virginia, on Friday before moving on to Chillicothe and Columbus, Ohio. By starting in West Virginia, she`ll be in a place that President Donald Trump carried by 42 points in 2016, but one that is suffering from the nation`s highest death rate from prescription drugs.

She`s hoping that reality will help her message resonate with people who may otherwise be skeptical of her brand of politics. At a time when many in the party are debating how to court rural voters, Warren`s trip could give her an opportunity to demonstrate an ability to connect with voters beyond the party`s traditional liberal base.

""I`m glad she is coming,"" said Kermit Fire Chief Tommy Preece, who lost a brother to an opioid overdose. ""It surprised me. She`s coming right into the middle of Trump country.""

Warren`s plan would spend $100 billion over 10 years on battling the public health consequences of addiction, modeled on a 1990 law passed to help fight the spread of AIDS.

She is visiting Preece`s volunteer fire department a few blocks from a now-closed pharmacy in Kermit where wholesale drug distributor McKesson Corp. shipped an average of 9,650 hydrocodone pills per day in 2007. A decade later, the town of 360 people along the Kentucky border fought back, suing McKesson and four other drug wholesalers, saying they illegally flooded Kermit with millions of prescription pills.

The lawsuit, one of many filed by municipalities throughout the state against drug distributors, seeks to recoup the costs of dealing with opioid abuse.

Last week Republican Gov. Jim Justice and Attorney General Patrick Morrisey announced the state reached a $37 million settlement in its lawsuit against San Francisco-based McKesson. Democrats, including U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, say the settlement was minuscule compared to the harm inflicted on West Virginians.

Get the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

In 2017, Preece`s brother, assistant Kermit fire chief Timmy Dale Preece, died of an overdose. Timmy Preece had been taking medication to help deal with the pain from a broken neck.

Tommy Preece, a Democrat, is open to Warren`s proposal because he believes the opioid crisis needs America`s fullest attention, especially in the two counties his department serves.

""It`s bad, it really is,"" Preece said. ""We have a lot of young kids in our community and we don`t want to see them go down this route.""

The scope of the epidemic predates their generation. Preece`s father, the late fire chief Wig Preece, was convicted in the 1980s of selling marijuana, pills and other drugs from a trailer parked near the Kermit town hall and police station. A sign posted on the trailer at one point by the elder Preece read, ""Out of drugs, back in 15 minutes.""

Wig Preece`s wife, six of their 14 children and their son-in-law, Police Chief David Ramey, also were sentenced to lengthy prison terms.

Kermit is located along the Tug Fork in Mingo County, which dubs itself ""The Heart of the Billion-Dollar Coalfield."" But West Virginia continues to be one of the poorest states in the nation, ranking 49th in per capita income, and is among those to lose thousands of jobs in the coal industry`s downturn this century.

Mingo County`s coal employment dropped from 1,750 jobs in 1997 to 764 last year, while production fell from 22.4 million tons to 5.1 million over the same period.

As the jobs have left, so too have the people. West Virginia`s population has dipped every year since reaching 1.86 million in 2012.

The county`s bloody history dates back to the Hatfield-McCoy feud that started in the late 1800s. Much of it has been intertwined with the fortunes of the coal economy.

In 1920, 18 coal company detectives tried to evict striking miners from their company-owned homes in Matewan, a Mingo County coal town. Gunfire broke out when the detectives produced a warrant for the arrest of police chief Sid Hatfield. Seven detectives, two miners and Mayor C.C. Testerman died in what became known as the Matewan Massacre. Nineteen people were indicted in the massacre but there were no convictions.

In the 1980s, as the coal economy weakened, jobs began to disappear and people increasingly turned to crime and drug abuse to fill the void of economic despair. The federal government stepped in to help clamp down on political corruption in the county, resulting in multiple arrests and convictions.

In 1996, a man who admitted killing a high school homecoming queen to settle a $2,000 drug debt and keep her from testifying about a local drug dealer was sentenced to at least 20 years in prison.

In 2013, Sheriff Eugene Crum was fatally shot while eating lunch in his cruiser. Later that year a Mingo County circuit judge, the county prosecutor and a county commissioner were charged and later sentenced to federal prison for their roles in corruption schemes."," Warren bringing opioids message to hard-hit W.Va., Ohio ",5-2019
"Five state attorneys general announced legal filings Thursday seeking to hold the drug industry responsible for an opioid addiction crisis that has become the biggest cause of accidental deaths across the country and in many states. The new filings in Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, West Virginia and Wisconsin mean 45 states have now taken legal action in recent years against Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin.

All but Kansas also named Richard Sackler, a former president and member of the family that owns the Connecticut-based firm, as a defendant. Maryland named other members of the Sackler family in its administrative action.

Purdue released a statement denying allegations of wrongdoing.

""The states cannot link the conduct alleged to the harm described, and so they have invented stunningly overbroad legal theories, which if adopted by courts, will undermine the bedrock legal principle of causation,"" the company said.

Some states have also sued other drugmakers or distributors as the fallout from the crisis moves increasingly to courthouses.

""There`s far too much senseless death in West Virginia and many ruined lives,"" that state`s Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said Thursday. ""We cannot and will not tolerate companies that allegedly use false and misleading information to deceive medical personnel and patients.""

States` suits are among the highest-profile claims in flood of litigation over the crisis. Opioids, including prescription painkillers and related drugs such as heroin and fentanyl, were involved in nearly 48,000 deaths in the U.S. in 2017 - more than AIDS killed at the peak of that epidemic and more than auto accidents kill annually. The death toll since 2000 is 391,000.

The states and about 2,000 local and tribal governments that have sued assert that Purdue and other companies downplayed the addiction dangers of the drugs and used sales representatives to encourage doctors to prescribe even more of them.

But the legal cases are complicated. Purdue points out that the majority of the recent deaths are linked to heroin or fentanyl - not prescription drugs. States say most users, though, start with prescription pills, whether they`re prescribed to them or diverted.

A judge in North Dakota last week dismissed all of that state`s claims against Purdue, perhaps the company`s biggest court win in a round of litigation. In a written ruling that the state says it will appeal, Judge James Hill questioned the idea of blaming a company that makes a legal product for the deaths. ""Purdue cannot control how doctors prescribe its products and it certainly cannot control how individual patients use and respond to its products,"" the judge wrote, ""regardless of any warning or instruction Purdue may give.""

Mark Cheffo, a lawyer for Purdue, said he`s hoping other judges will reach similar conclusions as they delve into the cases.

All the cases filed by state governments except one are working their way through state courts. Alabama`s case is among about 1,500 in federal court and being overseen by one federal judge based in Cleveland. He has rejected arguments to dismiss the suits and has scheduled an initial trial in October for the claims of two Ohio counties.

The looming trial could put pressure on Purdue and other companies to settle the cases - something the judge has said he wants to see.

In March, Purdue and the Sackler family, which owns the company, settled with Oklahoma for $270 million. Purdue also settled with Kentucky in 2015 for $24 million. A handful of other companies have entered deals with states in the last few years, including drug distribution firms that have agreed to pay West Virginia a total of $84 million.

Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, one of the leaders of a multistate investigation of the opioid crisis, announced a lawsuit earlier this week against Purdue, saying the company was not working in good faith on a settlement. Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller also said lack of progress in talks was a factor in filing a lawsuit now. ""There was a hope that the negotiations would yield a settlement for all the states,"" he said. ""And may still.""

Cheffo, the Purdue lawyer, disputed that in a phone interview Tuesday. ""While we recognize the complication of a resolution process involving so many different parties and interests and certainly cannot get into the details of them, we remain optimistic and believe that both sides are participating in good faith in an effort to try to reach some resolution that is in the best interests of the parties and the public health.""

A lawyer representing members of the Sackler family has said the family would also like to settle.

For some states, there`s a political element in deciding to join the litigation now.

For instance, Wisconsin didn`t sue earlier because Republican Attorney General Brad Schimel opted to join a multistate investigation instead. Schimel argued that it would be a faster way to hold them accountable. But Schimel was defeated in November by Democrat Josh Kaul, who campaigned on a platform that included filing opioid lawsuits.

A previous version of this story misspelled the name of West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. The correct spelling is Morrisey, not Morrissey. This version also clarifies that the Maryland filing is an administrative action, not a lawsuit and corrects that Purdue lawyer Mark Cheffo gave an interview Thursday, not Tuesday.", 5 states announce new suits over prescription opioids ,5-2019
"Five states announced Thursday that they are taking legal action against Purdue Pharma and members of the Sackler family who control the drug company, accusing them of deceptively pushing powerful painkillers and misrepresenting the drugs’ safety as the pills sparked the opioid crisis.

Attorneys general of West Virginia, Maryland, Kansas, Iowa and Wisconsin took part in the coordinated effort against the manufacturer of the powerful narcotic OxyContin. All but Kansas targeted at least one member of the Sackler family, former president Richard Sackler, and Maryland named seven family members but not the company in an administrative filing.

In a news conference, West Virginia’s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey said his state was seeking to hold both the company and Richard Sackler responsible for deaths and other harms from the worst drug epidemic in U.S. history.

“Even when it became apparent that thousands of people were dying of opioid abuse, Purdue doubled down by continuing its relentless and deceptive campaign” to persuade doctors to write prescriptions for OxyContin, Morrisey said.

Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh said his state’s efforts were based on “two foundational falsehoods” that Purdue promoted widely: That the risk of becoming addicted to Purdue’s drug was very low and that under-treating pain could cause great harm.

At least 40 other states have sued companies involved in manufacturing, distributing or dispensing opioids. About 1,600 cities, counties, Native American tribes and others have also filed claims that have been consolidated in an enormous federal lawsuit in Cleveland.

Recent state lawsuits are increasingly naming Sackler family members, in part because of evidence that they may have transferred billions of dollars out of the company and into personal accounts over about a decade. Some of the attorneys general also said Richard Sackler controlled the company’s strategy to push high doses and increasing amounts of the drug.

In a statement issued Thursday, Purdue said the “complaints are part of a continuing effort to try these cases in the court of public opinion rather than the justice system. The states cannot link the conduct alleged to the harm described, and so they have invented stunningly overbroad legal theories, which if adopted by courts, will undermine the bedrock legal principle of causation.”

In March, Purdue agreed to a $270 million out-of-court settlement with the state of Oklahoma, where the company faced its first trial on these issues. Members of the Sackler family will pay $75 million of that total from personal funds over five years.

Last week, Purdue won a victory in state court when a North Dakota judge dismissed the state’s lawsuit against Purdue.

Purdue’s president and chief executive, Craig Landau, said in March that declaring bankruptcy is an option the company might have to explore if jury verdicts or settlements become too costly.

Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller said Thursday that the states had been negotiating with the company but decided to abandon that approach in favor of legal action.

Thursday’s announcement came a day after New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art became the latest cultural institution to say it would no longer accept donations from members of the Sackler family, who are major philanthropists to art museums and educational institutions around the world.

Overdoses caused by legal and illegal opioids are responsible for more than 400,000 deaths since 1999, with about half from prescription narcotics, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The states are seeking compensation for the costs of responding to overdose deaths and addiction during the two-decade drug crisis that began after Purdue introduced OxyContin in 1996. The company aggressively promoted the drug to physicians for a wide variety of aches and pains, though experts say it should be used primarily for end of life care and the pain of cancer and surgery.

In documents released in February as part of its lawsuit, Massachusetts alleged that members of the Sackler family aggressively directed sales representatives to push extremely high doses of the drug and persuade doctors to write more prescriptions for more frequent use.

The state’s attorney general, Maura Healey, accused the company of engaging in frequent acts of deception and misconduct to make as much money as possible.

In a court filing responding to the lawsuit, lawyers for members of the Sackler family said Healey’s lawsuit contains “misleading and inflammatory allegations” and takes internal company emails out of context.

New York also has targeted the Sackler family in its lawsuit.

In 2007, Purdue and three of its executives pleaded guilty to criminal charges of misleading doctors, regulators and the public about the dangers of the drug and collectively paid $635 million in fines.

Morrisey noted that West Virginia had previously sued Purdue in 2001, recouping $10 million in a settlement with the company. But he said the state was legally entitled to pursue Purdue again because it had not changed its practices.

He promised to “get as much as we possibly can for the state of West Virginia,” which, he said, had suffered “far too much senseless death” and “many ruined lives.”

"THE PROGNOSIS

Actress Glenn Close, second from left, and Sens. Roy Blunt (D-Mo.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) discuss mental heath at a Washington Post Live event.

Actress Glenn Close still remembers vividly the dramatic and troubling scene when her nephew, Calen, had a psychotic break as a 17-year-old living in Montana.

“He had to be put in a straitjacket and driven two hours to the closest place where he could get help,” Close said at a Washington Post Live event yesterday.

The lack of accessible help for Calen -- and that he had to go to the emergency room instead of getting treatment prior -- is part of the reason she’s asking Congress to expand and extend funding for mental health care through a pilot program scheduled to expire on July 1.

Close became a mental health advocate after encountering serious illness within her own family — not just Calen, who has schizophrenia, but also her sister Jessie, diagnosed with bipolar disorder with psychotic tendencies.

She’s backing a program approved five years ago under a bill from Sens. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), which the senators are now trying to expand from eight states to 19 states for another two years. The bill gives extra Medicaid dollars to community clinics in return for providing a wide range of mental health services. Its aim is to correct a shortcoming in the country’s health-care system, which often prioritizes care for physical ailments but not for mental conditions such as depression, anxiety or bipolar disorder.

Under the pilot, more than 350 health clinics serving a quarter-million Medicaid patients have been able to get fully reimbursed by the federal government for the full range of mental health care. If funding isn’t extended, the centers may have to lay off 3,000 newly hired staff, cut off medication-assisted treatment to 9,000 patients and reestablish wait lists for mental health services, according to estimates provided by the senators’ offices.

“We have seen psychiatric crisis services, 24-hour services, start up in the community,” Stabenow said. “So, someone`s not going to the jail, someone`s not sitting in emergency room for hours or maybe days trying to get help, and it`s transforming those communities.”

Diagnoses of mental illness are on the rise in the United States, particularly among youth. Substance abuse, which often goes hand in hand with mental illness, has also spiked. Yet a large share of people don’t get the help they need, due to a variety of reasons including stigma, insufficient insurance coverage and the unique nature of mental illness, which can discourage patients from seeking care independently.

That was the case for Close’s sister and her nephew. She described her shock when Jessie confided in her that she couldn’t stop thinking about killing herself.

“Our family had absolutely no vocabulary for mental health,” Close said. “We just — we didn’t really get it…I had no clue. She was very good at keeping what she was going through from all of us.”

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration estimates that half of adults and teens with any mental illness and one-third of adults with serious mental illness don’t get any kind of treatment. Blunt and Stabenow’s bill tries to get at the problem by expanding mental health services covered via Medicaid, the government program for the low income which is also the single-largest payer of mental health services in the United States.

To be eligible for the increased Medicaid payments, a clinic must be certified as a Community Behavioral Health Clinic. That involves showing it provides a comprehensive set of services including 24-hour crisis counseling, substance abuse treatment and mental illness screenings. Part of the idea is to make treatment more readily available to patients before they end up in emergency rooms or in the criminal justice system.

“For the better part of 50 years the emergency room and law enforcement have been the de facto mental health delivery system in the country,” Blunt said. “And nobody is well served by that or satisfied by that.”

Stabenow said she’ll never forget when the sheriff in Cook County, Ill., told her he had just hired a psychiatrist as a jail director.

“He said, ‘Well, it’s real simple. Over half the people in my jail have mental health problems,’ ” Stabenow recalled.

Then there’s the issue of stigma, a major reason people don’t seek out help before their illnesses make it hard to function. Both Jessie and Calen found the stigma around their illnesses was “just as painful” as dealing with the illnesses themselves, Close said.

“Calen lost all his friends,” Close said. “Jessie felt that she was frightened to tell parents about her bipolar disorder because she was afraid they wouldn’t allow their children to come and play with her young daughter at the time.”

There are signs that the stigma is starting to thin, as more public figures share their own experiences. Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.), took to the Senate floor on Wednesday to share her struggle with depression that started in college and returned in her 30s. She described the experience as a “spiral” and called herself “one of the lucky ones” because she had insurance that allowed her to see a therapist.

“Down and down I went, until I could no longer see hope on the horizon,” Smith said. “Now, I was never suicidal, but I was struggling to function. I definitely wasn’t living my best life; I really wasn’t living at all. And that’s the reality for mental illness for millions of Americans.”

Today I’m sharing my experience with depression in a speech on the Senate floor. It’s the story of millions of Americans. But I’m sharing mine because I want to urge anyone who struggles w/ a mental health issue to know it`s okay to reach out and seek help https://t.co/S0sZSYDUo0 — Senator Tina Smith (@SenTinaSmith) May 15, 2019

But talking more about mental illness has raised another concern among advocates: that it’s possible to address the topic in unhelpful ways, ways that could even trigger people to act upon suicidal thoughts. The Netflix series “13 Reasons Why” recently came under scrutiny when a study purported to find a spike in youth suicides in the month after the show was released.

Close called the series “irresponsible.”

“My sister went through suicide ideation,” Close said. “She tried to end her life twice. And I think you have to take responsibility because there’s so much potential for impact with our social media. You really have to take responsibility for the stories that you tell.”

AHH, OOF and OUCH

AHH: It took 18 days last fall for the University of Maryland to inform its students about the presence on campus of adenovirus. It’s a virus that can appear with symptoms similar to a cold or flu but can be dangerous for people with weakened immune systems, making early detection critical.

The outbreak left one student, 18-year-old Olivia Shea Paregol, dead.

More than 40 students were sickened overall during the outbreak in November and December and 15 people were treated at hospitals, our Post colleagues Jenn Abelson, Amy Brittain and Sarah Larimer report in this investigation about the outbreak told through Olivia’s story. The reporters spoke with more than 100 people during the course of their reporting to explain how the university’s communication delay left the community in the dark.

After learning of the virus’s presence on campus, university officials “discussed — but decided against — notifying students with compromised immune systems and residents living in Elkton Hall, according to records reviewed by The Washington Post,” our colleagues write.

“Many parents and students have denounced the administration’s handling of the viral outbreak and the mold infestation, complaining its actions endangered thousands of students, faculty and staff on campus,” they add. “In recent statements to The Post, university officials defended their actions ... They said they went beyond what was legally required to address the adenovirus outbreak and public health officials advised that it was not necessary to inform the public about the virus.”

Family and friends who lost loved ones to opioid overdoses protest outside the headquarters of Purdue Pharma, maker of the prescription painkiller OxyContin, in Stamford, Conn. (Jessica Hill/AP)

OOF: Five states — Virginia, Maryland, Kansas, Iowa and Wisconsin — said they will sue opioid manufacturer Purdue Pharma and members of the Sackler family that controls the company, for allegedly “deceptively pushing powerful painkillers and misrepresenting the drugs’ safety as the pills sparked the opioid crisis,” our Post colleague Lenny Bernstein reports.

The five states join at least 40 others that have filed suits against companies that are in some way involved in the making, distributing and dispensing of opioid drugs. Another 1,600 counties, cities and Native American tribes have filed claims that have been consolidated in a massive federal lawsuit in Cleveland.

""All but Kansas targeted at least one member of the Sackler family, former president Richard Sackler, and Maryland named seven family members but not the company in an administrative filing,"" Lenny writes. ""In a news conference, West Virginia’s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey said his state was seeking to hold both the company and Richard Sackler responsible for deaths and other harms from the worst drug epidemic in U.S. history.""

“Even when it became apparent that thousands of people were dying of opioid abuse, Purdue doubled down by continuing its relentless and deceptive campaign” to push physicians to prescribe OxyContin, Morrisey said at the news conference.

OUCH: The Ebola outbreak is only getting worse in Congo, as is widespread fear among health workers trying to combat the outbreak. The death toll has reached 1,136 this week, and the number of infections rose to 1,632.

Misinformation has driven distrust of those in medical uniforms, making some doctors battling what is the second-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history afraid to wear their scrubs, as our Post colleagues Danielle Paquette and Lena H. Sun report.

There have been 119 attacks this year against health workers, according to the World Health Organization, with 85 people wounded or killed.

“And the violence hampers the response effort in a more direct way: Ebola infections tend to spike after attacks, experts say, because emergency responders are forced to take cover and halt the distribution of immunity-boosting vaccinations,” Danielle and Lena write. “Concerns are growing that the crisis in Congo’s North Kivu province could become as lethal as West Africa’s battle against the hemorrhagic fever from 2013 to 2016, which killed 11,310 people across three countries.”

HEALTH ON THE HILL

Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.) right, joins House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer at a news conference Wednesday. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)

— House Democrats passed legislation yesterday to lower prescription drug prices and to reverse some changes made by the Trump administration around the Affordable Care Act, a move that sets up the Democratic Party with yet another chance to tout a health-care message ahead of the 2020 election, our Post colleague Amy Goldstein reports.

In a 234-183 vote, five GOP members joined every Democrat in passing legislation to block rules from the Trump administration meant to encourage people to buy cheaper, short-term health plans that typically cover fewer services. The legislation also restores funding for advertising and other outreach to help people sign up for ACA marketplace plans. The package also includes three strategies to boost the availability of generic drugs, measures that initially had Republican support before Democrats packaged them with the measures to reinforce the ACA.

“The upshot was a barbed debate: Democrats accused Republicans of disregarding consumers’ need for affordable, quality health care, and Republicans accused Democrats of thwarting a rare opportunity for bipartisanship,” Amy writes.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) Pelosi also took a jab yesterday at the Senate, which is not planning to consider the legislation.

“I have some news for the distinguished leader in the Senate, the Republican leader,” she said. “The support for these bills is alive and well among the American people. He will be hearing from them because these bills are a matter of life and death and certainly quality of life for America’s working families.”

Daniel O`Day, chief executive of Gilead Sciences, testifies Thursday before the House Oversight Committee during a hearing on pricing for the company`s HIV prevention drug, Truvada. (Bill O`Leary/The Washington Post)

— Gilead Sciences CEO Daniel O’Day defended the high cost of the manufacturer`s highly effective HIV treatment, Truvada, before a House committee yesterday.

“We have taken the disease from a death sentence to a manageable clinical condition, but we’re not done yet,” O’Day said. “We have to be sure that Americans get our medicines at a price that allows us to invest in research.’’

During the hearing, lawmakers questioned the high cost of the drug and noted it was research conducted by governent scientists at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention that helped develop Truvada, as our Post colleague Christopher Rowland reports.

“This treatment was developed as a result of investment made by the American taxpayers. The problem is that Gilead, the company that now sells the drug, charges astronomical prices,’’ House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said. He pointed to how the price has shifted from $800 a month when it was introduced in 2004 to now about $2,000 a month. “How can Gilead do this? How can our system allow a company to take a drug treatment that was developed with taxpayer funds and abuse its monopoly to charge such astronomical prices?’’

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) asked O’Day why the drug’s list price is nearly $2,000 in the United States when it’s $8 in Australia.

“Truvada still has patent protection in the United States, and in the rest of the world it is generic,"" O`Day said. ""I can’t comment on the price in Australia of the generic medicines, but it is generically available in other parts of the world and will be generically available in the United States as of September in 2020.” Christopher notes that scheduled generic availability is set to slash the company’s current earnings of $3 billion a year from the drug.

REPRODUCTIVE WARS

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). (Zach Gibson/Getty Images)

— House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said he opposes the new Alabama law that effectively bans all abortions in the state, saying it “goes further than I believe.”

“I believe in exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother, and that’s what I’ve voted on,” McCarthy said at his weekly news conference, as our Post colleagues Felicia Sonmez and Mike DeBonis report. He said rape and incest exemptions are “exactly what Republicans have voted on in this House.”

His remarks came the day after Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) signed what is the country`s strictest antiabortion law, outlawing abortions without any exceptions for rape or incest and which penalizes doctors who perform the procedure with up to 99 years in prison.

“Republicans are wary of a reprise of 2012, when they lost two key Senate races in Indiana and Missouri after the party’s nominees in those states made comments about pregnancies resulting from rape,” Felicia and Mike write. “The debate over the Alabama law also comes at a time when Republicans are looking to make inroads with suburban women, a voting bloc that they lost when Democrats recaptured the House in 2018.”

— Missouri’s Republican-controlled Senate made the state the latest in a slew of states to pass strict antiabortion legislation. Republican lawmakers voted 24 to 10 to pass a bill to ban abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy.

The bill is now headed to the state’s Republican-controlled House, as our Post colleague Lindsey Bever reports. Republican Gov. Mike Parson has expressed support for the measure.

Parson tweeted before the bill’s Senate vote:

The bill would penalize any doctor who performs the procedure with up to 15 years in prison. It includes no exceptions for rape or incest, and only allows women to get an abortion after the eighth week of pregnancy in cases of medical emergencies, which it defines as “a condition which, based on reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert the death of the pregnant woman or for which a delay will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman.”

In a statement to The Post, M’Evie Mead, director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Missouri, said the GOP lawmakers “are putting the health and lives of Missouri women at risk in their race to make our state the one that overturns Roe v. Wade at the Supreme Court.”

"CHARLESTON, W.Va. - (AP) -- West Virginia`s Roman Catholic diocese failed to publicly disclose decade-old allegations of sexual abuse of a student involving a Catholic school teacher, the state`s attorney general said Tuesday.

Attorney General Patrick Morrisey announced an amended lawsuit against the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston and former Bishop Michael Bransfield.

A diocese spokesman didn`t immediately comment on the complaint. It accuses the diocese of keeping secret a 2006 report on sexual abuse allegations involving a teacher in Kanawha County.

Morrisey said an internal investigation alleged the teacher used alcohol and prescription drugs to gain a teenage student`s trust before multiple incidents of abuses occurred.

Like the original suit, the amended complaint cited the state Consumer Credit and Protection Act, accusing the diocese of ""unfair competition"" over other schools when it advertised for prospective students to join its schools and camp without disclosing the employment of accused priests.

The amended complaint alleges Bransfield was personally advised that more than 20 background checks were not done at a Catholic elementary school in Charleston between 2007 and 2008.

Morrisey`s original lawsuit filed in March accused the diocese and Bransfield of a cover-up, adding the diocese didn`t conduct background checks on admitted abusers and priests credibly accused of child sexual abuse.

Attorneys for the diocese and Bransfield filed a motion last month to dismiss the lawsuit.

On Tuesday the diocese said in a statement that some of the allegations in the amended lawsuit weren`t accurately described.

""In the strongest terms, we deny the allegation that initial background checks were not conducted on school employees, as the amended complaint contends,"" the diocese said.

In one decades-old instance cited in the original lawsuit, Rev. Victor Frobas, who was forced out of the Philadelphia seminary system because of a credible accusation of child sexual abuse, was made the director of a summer youth camp owned by the diocese. Frobas was then accused of sexually abusing children at that post and, following a leave of absence, was later assigned to work as a chaplain at Wheeling Central Catholic High School, the lawsuit said.

Frobas was convicted in 1988 of molesting two boys at a parish in suburban St. Louis. He served more than two years in prison and died in 1993.

In November the West Virginia diocese released the names of 18 priests or deacons who it said had been credibly accused of child sexual abuse since 1950, including 11 who had since died. None of the others are in active ministry.

Bransfield resigned last year and the Vatican appointed Baltimore Archbishop William Lori to take over the Wheeling-Charleston diocese. Bransfield had been implicated in a 2012 case against Philadelphia priests accused of sexual abuse, but he denied abusing anyone.

Catholic Church officials in March imposed ministerial restrictions on Bransfield pending the Holy See`s final assessment on the investigation into the claims in West Virginia.

""There are many, many wonderful people in the church. I know many of them. I`m a practicing Catholic,"" Morrisey said at a news conference in Wheeling. ""And I can say to you that a lot of people have been deeply disturbed by the activities and the cover-up here. The most important thing everyone can do now is to come clean, to be transparent, acknowledge the mistakes and move forward.""", Amended sex abuse suit filed against W.Va. Catholic diocese ,5-2019
"CHARLESTON, W.Va. - (AP) -- West Virginia`s only Roman Catholic diocese has released the names of two more priests who it says have been credibly accused of child sexual abuse in the state.

The priests are accused of committing the abuse while working at the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston. Both are deceased.

One of them, the Rev. Raymond Waldruff, previously was accused of abuse in the Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in the 1960s. Complaints of decades-old abuse were made against him in March in the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston and in April in the Diocese of Owensboro, Kentucky.

Waldruff served at two churches in north-central West Virginia in the 1970s.

The other priest, the Rev. Andrew F. Lukas, was accusing of abusing a minor in the 1960s. The allegation was reported to the diocese in January.

Eight other priests added to the latest list had claims against them in other regions or dioceses but not in West Virginia. None are in active ministry.

The Intelligencer and Wheeling News-Register first reported on the updated list, which brings to 40 the number of accused priests or deacons who served in West Virginia.

The diocese posted the list on its website last week. The original list was posted in November.

Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston spokesman Tim Bishop said in a statement Tuesday that the updated list shows ""the Diocese`s commitment to transparency and accountability.""

West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey filed a lawsuit in March accusing the diocese and former Bishop Michael Bransfield of knowingly employing pedophiles and failing to conduct adequate background checks on camp and school workers.

Morrisey said in a statement that the diocese quietly updated the original listing without immediately trumpeting its release.

""If the Diocese truly sought closure and healing for victims, it would make good on its obligation to announce updates to its findings so those victimized would feel empowered to seek counseling and know they are not alone,"" Morrisey said.

Instead, ""the Diocese appears fixated upon its goal of minimizing this scandal with limited publicity about wrongdoing and maximum publicity of its public relations campaign to protect the Church.""", W.Va. Catholic diocese releases more accused priests` names ,5-2019
"CHARLESTON, W.Va. - (AP) -- An investigation into a former Roman Catholic bishop in West Virginia found a ""consistent pattern"" of sexual innuendo and suggestive comments and actions toward subordinates, the head of the Wheeling-Charleston Diocese said Wednesday.

The investigation involved claims against ex-Bishop Michael Bransfield , who resigned last year. A team of investigators determined the sexual harassment accusations against Bransfield were credible, said Wheeling-Charleston Diocese Archbishop William Lori, who released the report.

It found no conclusive evidence that Bransfield engaged in any sexual misconduct involving minors, he said.

The investigation also determined Bransfield misused church funds for his own benefit, Lori said.

No one responded to a telephone message left at a phone number listed for Bransfield. He also had been implicated in a 2012 case involving Philadelphia priests accused of sexual abuse, but he denied abusing anyone in that case.

""I am deeply pained by and sorry for the harm that the former bishop caused to those he was charged with shepherding,"" Lori said in a letter released by the diocese. ""There is no excuse, nor adequate explanation, that will satisfy the troubling question of how his behavior was allowed to continue for as long as it did without the accountability that we must require of those who have been entrusted with so much.""

According to the investigation, Bransfield also misused church funds, spending them on dining, liquor, gifts, personal travel and luxury items. The full amount was not disclosed, but Lori said he himself had received a total of $7,500 in financial gifts from Bransfield.

The archbishop said he has returned all of the money to the diocese ""in light of what I have come to learn of Bishop Bransfield`s handling of diocesan finances,"" and has asked that it be donated to Catholic Charities.

In addition, Bransfield made expensive renovations to his private residences in Wheeling and Charleston, along with his intended retirement residence, Lori said.

The team of investigators comprised five lay investigators, both Catholic and non-Catholic, Lori said. The completed investigation has been sent to the Holy See for final judgment.

Catholic Church officials in March imposed ministerial restrictions on Bransfield, who resigned in September after serving 14 years as the diocese`s bishop. The Vatican appointed Lori, the archbishop of Baltimore, to take over.

West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey filed a lawsuit in March accusing the diocese and Bransfield of knowingly employing pedophiles and failing to conduct adequate background checks on camp and school workers.

In a statement Wednesday, Morrisey called for the release of the diocese`s full investigation.

Cullman: An underwater forest with trees as tall as 60 feet has been hampering the search for the body of a woman who was thrown off a boat about two weeks ago. The Cullman Times reports many trees weren’t cut down as workers created Smith Lake near Birmingham more than 50 years ago. Phil Hutchens, a member of the Cullman County Sheriff’s Office dive team, says standing timber is now complicating the search for 26-year-old Kelsey Nicole Starling of Birmingham, who’s been missing since two boats collided on the night of July 4. Starling was thrown from one of them. One of the drivers is charged with boating under the influence. Teams haven’t been able to find any trace of Starling.

Igiugig: This tiny Alaska Native village is adopting an emerging technology to transform the power of a local river into a renewable energy source. The village council in Igiugig is the first tribal entity in the nation licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to harness river water that’s not connected to a dam. An underwater generator will be installed in coming days in the Kvichak River, part of a salmon-rich system that also provides subsistence food for the community of 70. Officials with Portland, Maine-based Ocean Renewable Power Co. say a trial river run of the RivGen Power System gives them confidence the system will not harm adult fish. Igiugig Village Council President AlexAnna Salmon says the generator is expected to greatly reduce reliance on costly diesel fuel.

Arkansas

Little Rock: A nonprofit plans to develop an online database of opioid-related overdoses in the state. Arkansas Drug Director Kirk Lane said Wednesday that the Arkansas Foundation for Medical Care is spearheading the project. He noted the database will give policymakers accurate information they can use for grants and prevention efforts. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the Justice Department awarded the state a nearly $1 million grant to fund the project. It’s expected the public database will be ready for use within six months. Gina Redford, the foundation’s analytics manager, said the database will only include information on overdoses involving opioids, which include prescription painkillers such as oxycodone and fentanyl along with heroin. Data out Wednesday from the Centers for Disease Control shows Arkansas had at least 433 fatal drug overdoses in 2018.

Oakland: An animal rescue group is asking for help caring for 89 baby snowy egrets and black-crowned night herons left homeless last week after a tree fell downtown. International Bird Rescue said Wednesday that it needs donations and volunteers to help feed and care for the baby birds rescued after an old ficus tree serving as a rookery split in half and partially fell last week, said JD Bergeron, the group’s executive director. The group is caring for 89 young birds and eggs rescued from the tree, including 50 snowy egrets and 22 black-crowned night herons. It also rescued 17 eggs that need intensive care and round-the-clock support. Another 20 birds died when the tree fell. The rescue group was already taking care of more than 200 Bay Area water birds at its busy hospital in the city of Fairfield, Bergeron said.

The data is included in the Department of Public Health and Environment’s draft inventory of the state’s greenhouse gases. The report projects 125.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other gases will be emitted in the state in 2020. That’s down from nearly 127 million metric tons in 2015 and 133 million metric tons in 2010. A new state law aims to cut emissions to at least 90% of 2005 levels, or about 113 million metric tons, by 2050. Officials project the state will still be well above that goal in 2030.

Connecticut

Hartford: Prisons officials say errors by nurses at the state women’s prison have caused five inmate methadone overdoses in recent months. The Department of Correction tells the Hartford Courant none of the overdoses at the York Correctional Institution in East Lyme was fatal. Two inmates had to be revived with an opioid overdose reversal drug. One York nurse was fired in connection with two of the errors, and three overdoses remain under investigation. Agency spokeswoman Karen Martucci says 300 inmates at York were on methadone treatment last year. She says while the percentage of dosing errors “is extremely low,” the department is reviewing the methadone distribution program and adding safeguards to prevent similar incidents. Prison workers union officials have warned of dangerous understaffing at state prisons.

Delaware

Wilmington: Ladybug Music Festival, believed to be the country’s largest annual celebration of women in music, has kicked off, bringing with it a new local beer, along with almost 60 acts performing at 15 locations around town. The event Thursday and Friday includes a headlining set paying tribute to the “Ladybugs of Soul,” including Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner, Whitney Houston and Chaka Khan. To celebration the occasion, Stitch House Brewery has released its first canned beer, made in collaboration with Milford’s Mispillion River Brewing. Ladybug Rose Lager is an easy-drinking raspberry- and rose hip-infused lager with a light 4% ABV. The cans, which boast Ladybug’s eye-popping colors of pink and yellow, are also sold by the case or in four-packs.

District of Columbia

Washington: Protesters angered by the federal detainment of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border blocked access to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement headquarters in the city this week and staged a sit-in. News outlets reports at least 10 sit-in demonstrators were arrested and charged with unlawful entry. Dozens marched from the National Mall to the agency’s site around lunchtime Tuesday, stopping federal workers from returning to their desks. The demonstration went on for hours as attendees sang and carried signs saying “Never again is now” and “Never again means close the concentration camps.” The protest was one in a string of similar demonstrations outside ICE facilities nationwide during which protesters called for the dissolution of ICE and an end to crowded detainment centers at the U.S.-Mexico border.

West Palm Beach: Officials are hoping a continuous loop of children’s songs played throughout the night will keep homeless people from sleeping on the patio of a city-owned rental banquet facility. West Palm Beach parks and recreation director Leah Rockwell tells the Palm Beach Post they’re trying to discourage people from sleeping outside the glass-walled Waterfront Lake Pavilion, which she says rakes in some $240,000 annually from events. The loop of “Baby Shark” and “Raining Tacos” is a temporary fix to keep homeless people off the patio. Rockwell says the city wants to formalize hours for the facility, which should make trespassing laws easier to enforce. Illaya Champion tells the Post “it’s wrong” to chase people away with music. He says he’ll still sleep there, but “it’s on and on, the same songs.”

Georgia

Savannah: Coastal Georgia’s largest county wants to help residents prepare for an emergency during hurricane season. The Chatham County Emergency Management Agency in Savannah plans to hold a free “Citizen Hurricane Academy” this weekend. The program includes presentations by meteorologists, local emergency planners and other experts on how evacuation decisions are made, how to prepare financially for a disaster and some basic first aid tips for use in emergencies. The Atlantic hurricane season began June 1 and runs until Dec. 1. Coastal Georgia evacuated for Hurricane Matthew in 2017 and Hurricane Irma in 2018. Both storms brought damaging wind and flooding to Georgia’s 100-mile coast. Hurricane Michael caused extensive damage farther inland last year.

Hawaii

Kailua-Kona: A developer has agreed to cancel a planned condominium project to preserve a surfing area. West Hawaii Today reports the landowner has agreed to work toward building a public space rather than the proposed five-story residence near the Banyans, a popular surfing spot on the north side of Holualoa Bay. Property owner Kilohana Makai LLC met in a second mediation session last week with people involved in a case challenging plans for the condominium. A spokesman says Kilohana Makai will work over the next year to 15 months to convert the 14,450-square-foot lot on the Big Island into a community space. Officials say Hawaii County could buy the property via a commission that maintains a list of properties considered “worthy of preservation.”

Idaho

Pocatello: Beekeepers and maintenance workers have removed roughly 30,000 bees that built a massive hive inside an Idaho State University campus landmark. The Idaho State Journal reports the bees were safely transported from the stone-and-wood Swanson Arch to a hive box at a nearby farm last Friday. Beekeeper Sarah Hofeldt says the bees were surprisingly docile, and no one was stung during the extraction. Hofeldt was safely able to remove the queen bee from the hive by hand without the use of smoke. She says the smokers can calm the bees but also can make it more difficult to move the bees into a transport container, which can increase bee fatalities. ISU students traditionally walk through the arch upon entering and graduating from the university.

Illinois

Springfield: A woman who recently got a 1993 postcard in her mailbox has tracked down the man who sent it to his children more than two decades ago. Kim Draper’s story about the mysterious Hong Kong postcard was first published in The State Journal-Register in Springfield. Masrour Kizilbash sent the postcard to his family while working overseas in 1993. He told the newspaper that he was “fascinated with the area” and wanted to share his experiences. Kizilbash’s family was living in Springfield at the time. He always figured they had received the postcard. With the help of social media, Draper learned that a son now lives in suburban Chicago. A reunion with the postcard is planned. Officials say it likely got tied up in Hong Kong or might have been stuck in old equipment.

Indiana

Indianapolis: The state’s attorney general has reversed himself and decided against appealing a federal judge’s decision to block a state law that would ban a second-trimester abortion procedure. A judge granted a preliminary injunction last month sought by doctors who perform dilation-and-evacuation abortions. Republican Attorney General Curtis Hill said after that ruling that he would try to have the injunction lifted, but he announced Wednesday that his office would concentrate on arguing that the law is constitutional. That decision means the law can’t be enforced while court proceedings continue. The law passed this spring by the Republican-dominated Legislature calls the abortion procedure “dismemberment abortion.”

Iowa

Emails show Iowa Department of Human Services Director Jerry Foxhoven routinely sent messages to employees lauding Tupac Shakur’s music and lyrics. (Photo: Charlie Litchfield/Des Moines Register)

Iowa City: The director of the state’s social services agency was a huge fan of the late rapper Tupac Shakur, and he frequently let his subordinates know it. Emails obtained by the Associated Press show that Iowa Department of Human Services Director Jerry Foxhoven routinely sent messages to employees lauding Shakur’s music and lyrics even after at least one complained to lawmakers. Then last month, he sent another such email to all 4,300 agency employees. He was abruptly ousted from his job the next work day. Foxhoven, 66, told employees he had been a huge fan of the hip-hop artist for years. He hosted weekly “Tupac Fridays” to play his music in the office. He traded lyrics with employees and marked his own 65th birthday with Shakur-themed cookies, including ones decorated with the words “Thug life.”

Kansas

Wichita: Authorities say a lab technician “fudged” the test results of sewage treatment plant wastewater that is dumped into the Arkansas River. The Wichita Eagle reports Director of Public Works Alan King said Tuesday that the city caught the error during a spot check and immediately reported it to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. The employee has since resigned. The problematic test results falsely reported how much organic and inorganic substance is floating in the water. It’s generally used as an indicator of sediment or silt in the water. King says Wichita’s permits shouldn’t be affected, and there was no danger to the public. Results from around the same time as the false one show that the city likely stayed within an acceptable range.

Kentucky

Frankfort: A new list of rankings from a high-profile polling organization is giving a big red thumbs-down to Gov. Matt Bevin. Kentucky’s chief executive is the least popular in the nation among voters in their own state, according to Morning Consult’s Q2 rankings, with a 56% disapproval rating vs. just 32% who approve. Bevin notably has ground to make up among voters in his own party, with an election looming in November. The governor faces a 40% disapproval rating among fellow Republicans in Kentucky, after a May primary election in which GOP challenger Robert Goforth, a state representative, scored 39% of the in-party vote to Bevin’s 52%. His net approval among Kentucky voters, according to the Morning Consult poll, sits at -24 overall, which breaks down to +11 among Republicans, -63 among Democrats and -26 among independents.

Louisiana

New Orleans: A favorite local confection is making a comeback seven years after a devastating fire. Louisiana’s economic development office announced Thursday that Hubig’s Pies will be produced again next year in suburban Jefferson Parish. Hubig’s made hand-sized turnovers with a glazed crust and fillings of chocolate, coconut or any of a variety of fruits. Wrapped in white paper labeled with a caricature of a chef known as Savory Simon, the pies were prominent for decades at retail checkout counters, including grocery and hardware stores. A 2012 fire gutted Hubig’s longtime bakery in New Orleans’ Marigny neighborhood. Production will resume in Jefferson Parish after a $1.37 million investment in a manufacturing facility. The state says Hubig’s will distribute pies from the Louisiana-Texas line to the Mobile, Alabama, area.

Maine

Kennebunkport: A curious visitor to a train museum that resembled a white throw pillow or perhaps a lost toupee turned out to be a rare albino porcupine. The young rodent turned up Tuesday at Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, perplexing the staff, who sought help identifying it via social media. The consensus was that it’s an albino porcupine. The Portland Press Herald reports the animal appeared to be a baby because its quills had not yet hardened. A spokeswoman for the museum said midday Wednesday that it hadn’t yet been seen again, but it was assumed to be lurking in the area. Porcupines are common in Maine, though albino ones certainly aren’t. About 1 in every 10,000 of the species is an albino porcupine.

Maryland

The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra is in dire financial straits. (Photo: Submitted)

Baltimore: An audit says a possible infusion of $3.2 million in state funds and savings from a shortened season may not be enough to save the cash-strapped Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. The Baltimore Sun reports the SC&H Group audit released Tuesday says both methods would only temporarily help BSO unless additional revenue streams are established. It says it’s unclear if the orchestra will survive the year. The audit considered the possible state emergency funding, which Gov. Larry Hogan refused to partially release this year, citing concerns that the state could soon face a $961 million deficit. Hogan signaled in May that he might not release the first installment of the funds, leading the orchestra to abruptly cancel its summer series and lock out musicians amid ongoing contract negotiations.

Massachusetts

Cape Cod: A citizens group is calling for eliminating federal protections for seals as officials seek ways to protect beachgoers from great white sharks. Peter Howell, a founder of the Seal Action Committee, says the Nantucket-based group wants Congress to amend the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act so that species can be removed from the law’s list of protected animals if their populations have sufficiently rebounded. “We’re not anti-seal. We’re not trying to eliminate them. We’re just trying to manage them in the interest of the larger ecosystem,” he said Wednesday as the group spoke before the Barnstable County Commissioners, which oversees Cape Cod’s regional government. The region’s seal population – estimated in the hundreds of thousands – has been blamed for drawing droves of great white sharks in recent years. Seals are the favored meal for the powerful predators.

Michigan

Traverse City: Three historic Great Lakes lighthouses owned by the federal government are going on the auction block. They include Lake Huron’s Poe Reef Lighthouse, 6 miles east of Cheboygan, Michigan, which guides ships through a hazardous channel. The Ontonagon Breakwater Lighthouse is the westernmost lighthouse in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, perched at the entrance of the channel leading to the Ontonagon River from Lake Superior. The Superior Entry Lighthouse sits on a sandbar between Superior, Wisconsin, and Duluth, Minnesota. The U.S. General Services Administration is offering the lighthouses through an online auction. Their lighting mechanisms will continue aiding navigation and will remain the U.S. Coast Guard’s property. Proceeds from public lighthouse sales help pay to preserve and maintain those that remain active.

Minnesota

St. Paul: The developers of a proposed copper-nickel mine near the Boundary Waters plan to use a potentially safer dry method of storing mine waste instead of the kind of wet tailings pond more common in the industry. Twin Metals Minnesota said Thursday that its underground mine near Ely would use “dry stack” storage for waste rock, calling it the most environmentally friendly approach for the site. The method contrasts with the conventional tailings basin at the planned PolyMet mine, which will be contained by an earthen dam. While environmentalists pushed for dry stack storage at PolyMet, they’re criticizing Twin Metals because the waste would sit just a couple of miles upstream from the Boundary Waters. Twin Metals plans to release its formal mine plan in the coming months, triggering a lengthy environmental review.

Mississippi

Jackson: The American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi is asking 16 cities to eliminate local laws that penalize panhandling. The organization says in a news release that the request is part of a national effort that includes work by the National Law Center of Homelessness & Poverty. A federal appeals court in 2015 ruled that an ordinance in Springfield, Illinois, that penalized people for begging for money in public places is unconstitutional. ACLU of Mississippi says that since last year, four cities in the state have repealed panhandling ordinances – Ridgeland, Meridian, Starkville and Southaven. It’s asking other cities to do the same – Brandon, Clarksdale, Cleveland, Clinton, Corinth, Greenville, Greenwood, Grenada, Gulfport, Horn Lake, Jackson, Long Beach, Natchez, Olive Branch, Pascagoula and Vicksburg.

Missouri

Kansas City: The U.S. Department of Agriculture now says less than 40% of the researchers whose jobs are being transferred from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City will make the move to the Midwest. The Kansas City Star reports U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced in June that the USDA would move more than 550 jobs to Kansas City. A USDA spokesperson told The Star on Tuesday that 145 workers will follow their jobs to Kansas City, while 250 will leave the agency. Members of the Kansas and Missouri congressional delegations and the states’ governors praised the USDA’s move, saying the research agencies are a good fit for their region. But critics argued that moving them will make it harder for federal policymakers to get objective research.

Montana

Billings: Wildlife officials say evidence of an invasive clam that can out-compete native species has been found for the first time in a state water body. Fish, Wildlife and Parks officials say Asian clam shells were recently found near the boat ramp at Lake Elmo State Park in Billings. The discovery was made by participants in a training session on the detection of aquatic invasive species. No live clams were found. The quarter-sized mollusks are smaller than native clams that live in Montana. In large enough numbers, officials say they can clog screens on irrigation pumps or other water intakes. Since being discovered in Washington state’s Columbia River in 1938, Asian clams have spread to almost every state.

Nebraska

Lincoln: Plant science students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln are still taught to phenotype by hand, wading into muddy fields to record the differences in physical characteristics between varying corn hybrids with a small set of tools and a pen and notebook. But technology is on track to render that human work obsolete. A team of UNL plant scientists and biological systems engineers have built an automated system capable of detecting an individual corn leaf and grasping it with robotic precision to screen its temperature, chlorophyll and water content in less than a minute, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. Building a robot to automate the processes took years, as the team had to build a system that could identify the leaf from a corn or soybean plant, then direct a robotic arm where to reach and how to grab it for a battery of measurements, says Abbas Atefi, a Ph.D. candidate in biological systems engineering.

Nevada

Reno: Lake Tahoe is almost entirely full. For weeks, the roughly 1,644-foot-deep alpine lake – the second deepest in the U.S. – has been within an inch of its maximum allowed surface elevation of 6,229.1 feet above sea level. As of late last week, its surface elevation was 6,229.03 feet above sea level. For Chad Blanchard, the federal water master in Reno responsible for managing Tahoe’s waters, it’s the longest he’s ever seen the lake stay this high. “This is a rare year,” he says. “I’ve been doing this for 26 years, and we’ve had big (snow) years, but this one is unique as far as being up within an inch of being full, and it’s just hanging there ... it’s a product of still having so much snow up there.” Despite a good amount of snow still coating the peaks around Tahoe, Blanchard doesn’t expect the lake level to rise much more, with summertime surface evaporation starting to pick up.

New Hampshire

Milan: The Nansen Ski Jump has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Built in 1938, the 65-meter ski jump was the largest in the U.S. at the time, and it retains most of its original design. Officials said Wednesday that it was placed on the register because of its architecture and its place in U.S. sports history. Over the decades, Nansen was site of National Ski Jumping Championships, Olympic Ski Jumping qualifying events and U.S. Nordic combined championships. The ski jump was part of a planned bid by New Hampshire to host the 1944 Winter Olympics with cross-country skiing in Berlin, alpine events at Cannon, figure skating in Conway and bobsledding on Mount Madison. The games were canceled due to World War II.

New Jersey

East Newark: Famed restaurant Tops Diner will soon be demolished and rebuilt in the same spot, with new space three times the current size. Tops, which opened in 1942, has been approved for expansion by the Hudson County Planning Board. Owners Jimmy and John Golemis, whose father, George, bought the diner in 1972, could not be reached for comment on the expansion. Tops Diner has been named the “most iconic” restaurant in New Jersey by Thrillist; was ranked the best diner in the country by Time Out magazine; and was listed as the most famous restaurant in the state by Insider. According to reports from NJ.com and The Jersey Journal, the new space will feature 296 seats (up from 180), 160 parking spaces and outdoor seating. Tops Diner says construction will take at minimum four to six weeks, during which Tops will be closed.

New Mexico

Santa Fe: Thousands of small campaign contributions have helped propel former CIA operative and author Valerie Plame to the financial lead in a crowded primary for an open congressional seat in 2020. The Democrat raised $236,000 in May and June, according to disclosure forms and a statement from the campaign. Among notable donors were actor Bryan Cranston of “Breaking Bad” and Naomi Watts, who portrayed Plame in the 2010 film about her involvement in political jousting at the start of the Iraq War under President George W. Bush. In a field of eight primary contenders, Plame is the only national figure. Her identity as a CIA operative was leaked by an official in President George W. Bush’s administration in an effort to discredit her then-husband, diplomat Joe Wilson, a critic of the war in Iraq.

New York

Vernon: Woodstock 50 organizers have applied again for a permit to hold their festival at an upstate horse track, a day after losing an appeal for a previous denial. Town of Vernon officials say the application was submitted Wednesday. Woodstock 50 was previously denied a permit twice last week by the town. An appeal of the denial was upheld Tuesday night by the central New York town’s planning board. The Vernon Downs racetrack and casino became a possible alternative site for Woodstock 50 after the original venue, Watkins Glen International, pulled out. Woodstock 50 did not respond to a request for comment. Oneida County Sheriff Robert Maciol warned Thursday that “there is no practical or logistical possibility that this event could occur without significant risk to public safety.”

North Carolina

Hatteras: Sea turtles have again set a record for nesting at the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. A news release from the National Park Service says that with more than a month to go before the nesting season typically winds down, rangers discovered the 326th nest Monday. The previous record of 325 was set in 2016. As of Tuesday, there are 317 loggerhead nests, 11 green sea turtle nests and one Kemp’s Ridley nest. Tracy Ziegler, chief of resource management and science for National Parks of Eastern North Carolina, says it’s estimated that almost 11,000 sea turtle eggs have been deposited in beaches on Bodie, Hatteras and Ocracoke islands.

North Dakota

Bismarck: The state has sued the federal government to recover the $38 million the state spent policing protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline. Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem says he filed the lawsuit Thursday against the Army Corps of Engineers. He says the agency didn’t respond to an administrative claim he filed one year ago. The agency did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Stenehjem says the Corps allowed protesters to illegally camp without a permit on federal land along the Missouri River in southern North Dakota and failed to maintain law and order. The Corps has said protesters weren’t evicted due to free speech reasons. The pipeline carries oil from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois.

Ohio

Columbus: The Republican-led Legislature has passed a measure that would allow farmers and university researchers to grow industrial hemp and would legalize sales of hemp-derived cannabidiol oil, or CBD. Federal legislation last year removed hemp from the list of federally controlled substances and now treats the low-THC version of the cannabis plant like other agricultural crops. But existing Ohio law doesn’t differentiate between marijuana and hemp. The newly passed Ohio legislation would allow for cultivation of hemp as long as it contains less than 0.3% THC, the cannabis compound that gives marijuana its high. It would be regulated by the state. The measure was sent to GOP Gov. Mike DeWine for consideration. It would take effect immediately if he signs it.

Oklahoma

Oklahoma City: Oklahoma County has joined over 50 other cities and counties in the state to prosecute drug companies for damages caused by the opioid epidemic. The Oklahoman reports that all three county commissioners voted Wednesday to approve a contract with the Fulmer Sill law firm to sue opioid manufacturers. The decision comes at the end of the state’s trial against consumer products giant Johnson & Johnson, which alleges the company and its subsidiaries created a public nuisance by aggressively promoting the highly addictive drugs. Oklahoma could receive up to $17.5 billion in abatement costs. Commissioner Kevin Calvey says the opioid crisis has increased the county’s costs in policing, jailing and providing treatment services to residents. Fulmer Sill lawyers say they expect to pursue “tens of millions of dollars” for the county.

Oregon

Keizer: Four scorpions were brought to the Keizer Fire District after a woman found the abandoned arachnids inside a Red Vines licorice container near a playground at an area park Wednesday. A mother picked them up around noon and brought them to the fire district. Keizer Fire District Chief Jeff Cowan says the arachnids were confirmed to be Pacific Northwest forest scorpions, a species native to the Willamette Valley. The species is not aggressive. Though they can sting, they prefer to play dead when disturbed. The scorpions were then given to the Oregon Department of Agriculture, which maintains a staff of professional entomologists. Cowan says under the entomologists’ care, the scorpions will travel for outreach events such as the Oregon State Fair.

Pennsylvania

Wilkes-Barre: City officials have removed a public monument that included a recently added brick sponsored by a Ku Klux Klan affiliate. The Citizens’ Voice reports the column monument in Public Square was taken down three weeks after a brick was placed on it bearing the name of the East Coast Knights, a KKK chapter that has recruited in Wilkes-Barre. Harrisburg citizen activist Gene Stilp tried to chisel it off last week, resulting in a disorderly conduct charge, which he says he plans to fight. The monument was installed in 2008. Supporters could purchase engraved bricks for $35. Wilkes-Barre Mayor Tony George tells the paper it was time to tear down the monument, which he says wouldn’t have survived ongoing renovations to Public Square.

Rhode Island

Cranston: The state’s prison population is continuing to shrink as the percentage of older inmates rises. WPRI reports a 2018 Department of Corrections Population Report indicates 1 in 4 adults in the state’s correctional institutions in 2018 was over the age of 50, with more than 7% over 60. The 2009 population report disclosed that 17% of inmates were over 50, and 5% were over 60. The department says it categorizes inmates 50 and older as geriatric. The American Civil Liberties Union is also watching the aging prison population closely. Steve Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island, says everyone “should be concerned as taxpayers.” Data compiled by the nonprofit projects the number of elderly inmates to triple in the next 15 years.

South Carolina

Greenville: The Greenville County Council has moved forward on a roughly $40 million plan to relocate state offices from some expensive real estate downtown to a pair of office buildings near Haywood Mall. The decision at Tuesday night’s council meeting means the county is moving forward with the $1 billion commercial and residential redevelopment of County Square that council members first approved more than a year ago. The purchase price for the buildings, formerly part of the Fluor Corp. campus, will be $33.1 million, according to council members. The county will spend an additional $5 million to $8 million up-fitting the buildings for county and state services, according to a memo circulated to council members last March.

South Dakota

Sioux Falls: Dozens of children up to age 5 in the Sioux Falls School District and five rural districts now have access to mental health support in a way they never did before thanks to a $2 million grant given to Southeastern Behavioral Healthcare. The five-year grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration establishes the South Dakota Early Childhood Mental Health Collaborative to help Southeast Behavioral Health therapists reach an under-served population, what some call a “mental health desert,” through a partnership with South Dakota State University and federal school readiness programs like Head Start. And it will also develop some of the state’s first fully certified specialists in play therapy to help children discover healthy social and emotional coping skills, Southeastern officials said.

Memphis: If famed local dive bar Earnestine & Hazel’s didn’t have enough haunted lore swirling around it already, bones of an unknown origin tumbling out of the walls and landing at the feet of construction crews serve as one more paranormal episode the historic bar can now tout. Diversified Builders crews have resumed restoration work after a Wednesday night scare when bones fell out of a wall they were repairing. The contracting company’s vice president, Chris Tigner, says word got out quickly, and someone alerted police and inaccurately told them a body was in the bar. Police and fire crews swarmed the site about 11 p.m., Tigner says. There was no body, and no one can say with certainty what organism the bones originated from. Caitlin Chittom, owner of Earnestine & Hazel’s, says they’ve been sent away for identification.

Texas

Austin: A former judge who served on the state’s highest criminal court has denounced President Donald Trump in announcing her decision to leave the Republican Party. The Austin American-Statesman reports retired Texas Court of Criminal Appeals Judge Elsa Alcala announced her decision on Facebook. Alcala said in the Facebook post that even accepting that Trump has had some successes, “at his core, his ideology is racism.” Alcala said she can no longer support the GOP and will be voting in the 2020 Democratic primary. She was appointed to the court by Gov. Rick Perry in 2011 and spent 20 years as a GOP judge. Alcala’s announcement follows Trump’s tweets that four Democratic freshmen should “go back” to their home countries – though all are citizens, and three were born in the United States.

Utah

Wildlife officials say reports of bears in Utah have more than doubled this year. (Photo: Utah Division of Wildlife Resources via AP)

Salt Lake City: Wildlife officials say reports of bears coming down from the mountains and rummaging through backyards and campgrounds throughout the state have more than doubled this year. Faith Jolley with the Division of Wildlife Resources said Wednesday that her agency has already received more than 25 reports of black bears getting into trash cans and campsites, mostly in central Utah. In 2018 the DWR recorded 27 total bear encounters. None resulted in serious injury. The sharp increase can be attributed to a larger bear population and a wet spring that kept the bears hibernating longer than usual. State biologists say these factors have made bears bolder in searching for food. Jolley says residents can “bearproof” their surroundings by regularly cleaning their trash cans and storing food in locked cars while camping.

Vermont

Burlington: The Vermont Mozart Festival will not have a summer concert series this year. WCAX-TV reports that the organization said in a Facebook post this week that it is “currently reviewing opportunities and evaluating all options for the future, but will not have a summer season this year.” It didn’t say why. The festival, which celebrates the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, has struggled in recent years. It shut down in 2010 due to financial troubles. Then it was revived under new leadership, with partnership with communities and including food offerings and youth sports.

Virginia

Richmond: A limited-edition license plate is being offered to celebrate the University of Virginia men’s basketball team’s 2019 national championship. The state Department of Motor Vehicles worked with UVA to offer a license plate featuring the national champion’s logo. The plate is now available for purchase at any DMV customer service center, mobile office or online. It costs $25 annually, plus the cost of the registration, and can be personalized for $10. UVA license plates are part of the DMV’s revenue-sharing program, with $15 of the $25 fee returned to the university to support student scholarships. UVA has received more than $1.9 million from the program since it was established in 1992. The DMV also offers license plates as ornamental souvenirs. The $10 plates cannot be used on motor vehicles.

Washington

Olympia: The state Transportation Commission is expected to vote this year on a proposal to replace the gas tax with a pay-per-mile system. The vote will take place Dec. 17, after the commission is expected to receive a report in October from a panel that has studied the new type of tax, The Olympian reports. Any recommendation voted on by the commission will then be passed on to the Legislature to consider during its next session, which starts in January. Commission chairman Jerry Litt says he expects many state residents would pay more under a pay-per-mile tax, which the state calls a “road usage charge.” Sen. Rebecca Saldana, vice chairwoman of the Senate Transportation Committee, says the state is considering such a charge because she says more fuel-efficient vehicles have eroded the state’s ability to rely long term on the gas tax for transportation needs.

Charleston: A permanent prescription drug disposal site is being placed at the Capitol so people wanting to dispose of medication can do so all year. There has already been a collection site at the Capitol for National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day, but the new location is permanent. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey announced the plan Wednesday and said it is in collaboration with the Capitol Police. Morrisey says the use of disposal sites can affect substance abuse rates by reducing the number of available pills. This disposal site is at the Division of Protective Services Office in Building 1, Room 152-A.

Madison: Gov. Tony Evers has signed a bill that creates new tiers of sign language interpreters. The bill he signed Wednesday establishes criteria for new advanced and intermediate licenses for both deaf and hearing interpreters and requires the state Department of Public Safety to determine the scope of practice for each level. One of the bill’s chief Assembly sponsors, Democrat Jonathan Brostoff, refused to cut his hair for a year and a half as a stunt to pressure Republican legislative leaders to consider the proposal. His hair had ballooned into a thick, curly mop by the time the Assembly and Senate passed the proposal in June. He cut his hair days later.

Wyoming

Thermopolis: The skeleton of a nearly 3-foot-tall cousin of the velociraptor is now on display at the Wyoming Dinosaur Center. The Rock Springs Rocket-Miner reports the museum in Thermopolis opened a new permanent exhibit featuring the fossils and full-size reproduction of the dinosaur informally known as Lori. Paleontologists discovered Lori, whose scientific name is Hesperornithoides miessleri, in a formation dating to the late Jurassic period near Douglas in 2001. Center paleontologist Bill Wahl says Lori is the earliest troodontid that has been found in North America. It’s also the smallest dinosaur that has been found in Wyoming. Troodontids are bird-like predators that have sickle-like claws.

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston in West Virginia says Pope Francis has issued disciplinary action against its former bishop. (Photo: Dale Sparks, AP)

Despite new disciplinary action by Pope Francis, West Virginia`s attorney general called on a Catholic diocese to ""come clean"" with what it knows about alleged allegations of sexual harassment and financial improprieties by a former bishop.

The pope on Friday banned former bishop Michael Bransfield from the public ministry or even living in the Wheeling-Charleston diocese based on the findings of a church investigation of “allegations of sexual harassment of adults and of financial improprieties.""

The pope`s declaration, which stopped short of defrocking Bransfield, was posted on the website of the diocese of Wheeling-Charleston/ It also requires Bransfield, who resigned in December, to make amends ""for some of the harm he caused.""

That probe had earlier found Bransfield guilty of sexual harassment of adults and misuse of church funds, spending them on dining, liquor, gifts, personal travel and luxury items.

The Washington Post, which obtained a copy of drafts of the investigation, reported in June that the church found that Bransfield spent $2.4 million in church money on travel, much of it personal, which included flying in chartered jets and staying in luxury hotels. Bransfield and several subordinates spent an average of nearly $1,000 a month on alcohol, the Post said, citing the confidential report.

West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey on Friday called the pope`s decision ""only one step"" toward resolving the Bransfield case. He called on the diocese to comply with subpoenas issued as part of state probe of the church`s handling of the case..

""After decades of covering up and concealing the behavior of priests as it relates to sexual abuse, it is time for the Diocese to come clean with what it knows and release the Bransfield report and any other relevant materials,"" Morrisey said. ""None of the allegations of financial improprieties and sexual abuse may have been revealed if not for our investigation – the public shouldn’t have to wait any longer for transparency.""

Morrisey filed suit against the diocese and Bransfield in March alleging it knowingly employed pedophiles and failed to conduct adequate background checks for those working at the diocese’s schools and camps

An amended complaint added allegations that the Diocese chose not to publicly disclose a report of child sexual abuse by a teacher in 2006.

A statement from the diocese after the state`s suit was filed dismissed the allegations, saying it does not ""fairly portray its overall contributions to the education of children in West Virginia nor fairly portray the efforts of its hundreds of employees and clergy who work every day to deliver quality education in West Virginia.""

On Friday, the diocese announced that an independent auditor had been chosen to audit its accounts.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Colorado is among a coalition of 21 Democratic-led states that sued the Trump administration Tuesday over its decision to ease restrictions on coal-fired power plants, with California’s governor saying the president is trying to rescue an outdated industry.

In June, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency eliminated the agency’s Clean Power Plan and replaced it with a new rule that gives states more leeway in deciding upgrades for coal-fired power plants.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, says the new rule violates the federal Clean Air Act because it does not meaningfully replace power plants’ greenhouse gas emissions.

“They’re rolling things back to an age that no longer exists, trying to prop up the coal industry,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said at a news conference. He said the lawsuit was not just about Trump but “our kids and grandkids” who would continue to be harmed by coal pollutants.

West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, whose state produced the second-most coal behind Wyoming in 2017, predicted the lawsuit will ultimately fail at the U.S. Supreme Court, which stayed an earlier Obama administration attempt in 2016 at the request of a competing 27-state coalition.

He called the lawsuit a “big government ‘power grab’ ” and argued that the Democratic attorneys general “are dead wrong” in their interpretation of the Clean Air Act.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The U.S. EPA said in a statement that it wouldn’t comment on pending litigation, but that it “worked diligently to ensure we produced a solid rule that we believe will be upheld in the courts, unlike the previous administration’s Clean Power Plan.”

The lawsuit was filed by attorneys general in Colorado, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.

“The science is indisputable; our climate is changing. Ice caps are melting. Sea levels are rising. Weather is becoming more and more extreme,” New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement. “Rather than staying the course with policies aimed at fixing the problem and protecting people’s health, safety, and the environment, the Trump Administration repealed the Clean Power Plan and replaced it with this ‘Dirty Power’ rule.”

The states were joined by six local governments: Boulder; Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia and South Miami, Florida.

The EPA’s analysis of the new rules predicts an extra 300 to 1,500 people will die each year by 2030 because of additional air pollution from the power grid. But EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler in June said Americans want “reliable energy that they can afford,” adding he expected more coal plans to open as a result.

“It’s more of a fossil fuel protection plan,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said.

It would replace the Clean Power Plan, which would require cutting emissions fossil fuel-burning power plants. Becerra said that was expected to eliminate as much climate change pollution as is emitted by more than 160 million cars a year, the equivalent of 70 percent of the nation’s passenger cars, and was projected to prevent up to 3,600 additional deaths annually.

Newsom and James said states’ existing efforts to reduce greenhouse gases are beginning to work while creating green jobs and vibrant economies.

In the Northeast, 10 states including New York formed the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that has reduced power plant emissions by more than 50 percent.

California’s power grid used more energy from non-greenhouse gas sources like wind and solar power in 2017 than from electricity generated by fossil fuels for the first time since the California Air Resources Board began keeping track. The board also found that pollution from transportation did not rise as fast as in previous years, and reported that 2017 was the second straight year emissions fell below the state’s 2020 target.", Colorado among states suing Trump administration over new coal rules ,8-2019
"(CNN) Suspecting her 6-year-old daughter with autism was being abused at school, a West Virginia mother hid a recording device in her daughter`s hair, court documents say. On Friday, the girl`s former teacher and two former aides were arrested, the state`s attorney general said.

Christina Lester, the former teacher, and June Yurish and Kristin Douty, former aides, were charged with misdemeanor failure to report abuse or neglect, according to a press release from West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.

Amber Pack was concerned when her daughter Adri came home with bruises from Berkeley Heights Elementary in October. The marks appeared to be pressure bruises from tight grips, said Ben Salango, an attorney for the Pack family.

Adri was nonverbal, but she would cry getting on the bus and didn`t want to leave the house. It was clear she didn`t want to go to school, the attorney said.

Pack bought a recording device and put it in Adri`s hair bun.

"WASHINGTON — The Drug Enforcement Administration was “slow to respond” as America grappled with a rising opioid epidemic, the Justice Department’s inspector general said in a report Tuesday that faulted the agency for cutting back use of a key enforcement tool and continuing to raise production quotas even as the number of deaths rose.

“Unlike past drug crises, in combating the current opioid epidemic DEA failed to develop a comprehensive national strategy that could have focused and directed its regulatory and enforcement efforts,” the watchdog report found.

Some of the findings could bolster the claims of drugmakers and distributors who have said the government should share the blame for the crisis. The first federal trial on the crisis, dealing with claims against the drug industry from two Ohio counties, is scheduled to begin later this month in Cleveland.

Opioids, a class of drugs that includes powerful prescription painkillers such as OxyContin and Vicodin and illegal drugs including heroin and illicitly made fentanyl, have been linked to more than 400,000 deaths in the US since 2000.

The report examined the DEA’s regulatory and enforcement efforts to control opioids since the crisis began to come into focus. It found that as the number of opioid-related deaths drastically increased between 2013 and 2017, the DEA significantly reduced using one of its key enforcement tools — the ability to suspend manufacturers, distributors and other registrants to keep drugs from being diverted.

The report found the agency issued a peak of 59 of those “immediate suspension orders” in fiscal year 2011. But then the number started dropping, all the way down to five in fiscal 2015. The report said part of the reason for the decline was that so many pill mills had already been shut down. But part of it was an icy relationship between different offices in the agency.

In a response included with the report, the DEA said the decline in those suspensions was also due to a decrease in opioid prescriptions and an increase in prescribers, pharmacists and others surrendering their registrations.

The report also found the DEA raised the annual quota of the amount of oxycodone that can be manufactured by nearly 400 percent from 2002 to 2013. In court filings, drugmakers have said that they continued to increase production as the opioid crisis deepened because the DEA said they should.

The report notes the agency had told the US Government Accountability office previously that it’s difficult to set a limit that provides for legitimate medical needs and limits abuse and diversion. Since 2014, the oxycodone quota has been reduced, with the biggest cuts — of 25 percent — announced in 2016. The cuts have come as prescriptions have declined and fentanyl and other synthetic street drugs have become the biggest killers among opioids.

West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, sued in 2017 to try to force quotas down and resolved the suit last year. “Unfortunately, this mismanagement contributed to the senseless death of many Americans,” Morrisey said in a statement.

In the report, weaknesses were identified in the DEA’s registration process, which allowed manufacturers, distributors and health care providers to immediately reapply after their registration was revoked or surrendered.

The inspector general also called for the federal government to do something some states have done already: Require electronic rather than handwritten prescriptions for all controlled substances, saying that’s a way to cut down on fraud. The DEA agreed with that and most of the report’s recommendations.

In a statement, the DEA noted that it has taken steps to reduce the diversion of prescription drugs to the black market, but the agency also agreed that more changes need to be made.", Watchdog finds DEA was ‘slow to respond’ to opioid epidemic ,10-2019
"Trees have been cut for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which would run from West Virginia and across Virginia, in the forests of Buckingham County in Virginia. (Timothy C. Wright for The Washington Post)

— The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to consider whether a lower court was correct to block a major natural gas pipeline from crossing underneath the Appalachian Trail in the mountains of Virginia.

The high court’s intervention could remove a barrier for construction of the $7.5 billion, 600-mile Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which has been halted for nearly a year because of various permitting woes.

[Federal appeals court rejects permits for Atlantic Coast Pipeline]

Builders of the pipeline, led by primary stakeholder Dominion Energy, and the Trump administration appealed a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit that said the U.S. Forest Service lacked authority to grant a permit to tunnel under the popular hiking trail.

“The Supreme Court’s acceptance of our petition is a very encouraging sign and provides a clear path forward to resolve this important issue,” Dominion spokesman Aaron Ruby said via email Friday.

Dominion and its coalition, which also includes Duke Energy of North Carolina, say that more than 50 other pipelines cross beneath sections of the Appalachian Trail, which stretches from Georgia to Maine.

Environmental groups who brought the original challenge to the permit vowed to continue fighting.

“We will defend the lower court’s decision in this case,” the Southern Environmental Law Center and the Sierra Club said in a joint statement. “The Atlantic Coast Pipeline is a dangerous, costly, and unnecessary project and we won’t stand by while Duke and Dominion Energy try to force it on our public lands, threatening people’s health, endangered species, iconic landscapes, and clean water along the way.”

[Big company, big dollars, small community: Dominion deal sparks dissent in neighborhood facing gas project]

The Atlantic Coast Pipeline is being built through rugged and rural terrain from West Virginia, across the center of Virginia and into North Carolina. Opponents have fought it every step of the way, saying that it was hastily approved and that the natural gas it would deliver is not needed in a changing energy marketplace.

The project has attracted national attention, with former vice president Al Gore and the Rev. William Barber, a civil rights leader, visiting Virginia earlier this year to highlight the plight of a historic African American community being disrupted by pipeline construction. It has also factored into state politics, helping inspire a movement for candidates and lawmakers — most of them Democrats — to reject contributions from Dominion.

Federal judges suspended several permits last year, including those that set standards for allowable harm to endangered species of wildlife and that allowed the pipeline to cross national forests. The judges wrote that “the Forest Service abdicated its responsibility to preserve national forest resources” in a rushed and incomplete permitting process.

The most significant challenge to the project was the finding, issued in December, that the Forest Service lacked authority to give the pipeline permission to cross the Appalachian Trail. A panel of federal judges said the National Park Service had jurisdiction over the crossing, but the Park Service had said that it could not grant right of way without permission from Congress.

Dominion pursued legislative relief from Congress but considered its appeal to the Supreme Court to be a stronger recourse.

On Friday, Ruby said the company is confident that, with the support of the Trump administration’s solicitor general, it will prevail. Sixteen state attorneys general filed a brief with the court in support of the pipeline, along with several industry and labor groups.

“West Virginia strongly supports the Supreme Court’s decision” to take up the case, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said Friday in a news release. “We remain hopeful this decision is a precursor to ultimate victory and an end to the unnecessary delays that have negatively impacted the livelihoods of our working class families and the services they receive.”

The court is likely to take up the case early next year. Ruby said the company anticipates a ruling by June, and that it hopes to resolve its other permitting delays in a similar time frame. In that case, he said, construction could resume by next summer and wrap up by late 2021.

The Atlantic Coast Pipeline is one of two major natural gas projects under construction in Virginia. The Mountain Valley Pipeline has also faced delays in crossing mountainous terrain in the far southwestern part of the state.

"(Reuters) - Several U.S. states that have been ravaged by the opioid epidemic are pushing back on a proposed $48 billion settlement framework that would resolve thousands of lawsuits against five drug companies accused of fueling the addiction crisis.

FILE PHOTO - Cataldo Ambulance medics and EMTs, along with firefighters, revive a man in his 40`s who was found unresponsive after overdosing on an opioid in the Boston suburb of Salem, Massachusetts, U.S., August 9, 2017. REUTERS/Brian Snyder

The proposal would bring an end to all opioid litigation against AmerisourceBergen Corp(ABC.N), Cardinal Health Inc(CAH.N) and McKesson Corp(MCK.N), drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Inc(TEVA.TA)(TEVA.N), and Johnson & JohnsonJNJ.J.

The companies have proposed paying $22.25 billion cash mostly over 18 years, while services and drugs to treat addiction valued at $26 billion by the companies would be provided over the coming decade, mostly by Teva.

Officials in states such as Ohio, New Hampshire and West Virginia — all hard hit by the deadly drug addition crisis — voiced concerns about the proposal.

James Boffetti, the associate attorney general for New Hampshire, said in an interview he was troubled that payments were stretched over many years.

“The concern is, I think, the states need money now to create the infrastructure for treatment,” he said.

Small states fear the money will be divvied up by population rather than need.

“Any global opioid settlement that doesn’t reflect the unique and unprecedented damage imposed on West Virginia through the opioid epidemic should be DOA,” West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said on Twitter on Tuesday.

Some 400,000 U.S. overdose deaths between 1997 and 2017 were linked to opioids, according to government data. Roughly 2,600 lawsuits have been brought nationwide by states, local and tribal governments.

The three distributors in a joint statement said they were committed to finalizing a global settlement and would continue working with the other parties on the details of the framework. Teva declined to comment.

J&J said in a securities filing on Wednesday the deal would lower third quarter profit by $3 billion.

The proposal, announced on Monday, was hammered out by the companies and attorneys general in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas.

It will need broad support among state attorneys general and will have to overcome opposition from the lawyers representing local governments that sued. Those lawyers declined to sign on when presented the proposal last week.

Under the settlement framework, money for each state would be divvied up, with 15% going to the state treasury, 15% for local governments that filed lawsuits and 70% going to a proposed state fund aimed at addressing the crisis.

Boffetti predicted it would takes weeks for states to determine whether they back the settlement framework.

North Carolina’s attorney general, Josh Stein, acknowledged that a detailed term sheet needs to be developed.

“There are a lot of details and mechanics that need to be added to it,” Stein told Reuters in an interview. “That will happen in the coming weeks.”

The proposal did win a major supporter on Tuesday. Tom Miller of Iowa, the longest-serving attorney general, publicly backed the proposal, calling the framework “an important step in addressing the crisis.”

Colorado’s attorney general, Phil Weiser, called it a “very promising development.”

The lawsuits accuse distributors of failing to flag and halt a rising tide of suspicious orders and drugmakers of overstating the benefits of opioids while downplaying the risks.

The companies have denied any wrongdoing. Drugmakers say their products carried government-approved labels that warned of the addictive risks of opioids, while distributors argue their role was to make sure medicines prescribed by licensed doctors were available for patients.

The proposed deal has widened a fault line between attorneys general and local governments.

Cities and counties generally hired private attorneys to bring their cases, and attorneys general want to limit the amount of the settlement that goes to pay private lawyers. The attorneys for local governments also generally opposed Teva contributing opioid treatment drugs to the settlement, instead of cash, in part because of concerns that the framework placed an inflated value on those drugs.

Last week’s talks failed to reach a global deal, and on Monday, the three wholesale distributors and Teva struck a last-minute $260 million settlement with two Ohio counties, averting the first federal trial over opioids.

North Carolina’s Stein said he looked forward to resolving concerns about the proposal and warned that settling lawsuits individually was unsustainable.

“If we proceed on the current path and each county and city brings their case and extracts whatever amount they may be able to get from these companies, the companies will end up bankrupt,” he said. “The opioid crisis is a national problem that demands a national solution.”", Several states wary of $48 billion opioid settlement proposal ,10-2019

It will need broad support among state attorneys general and will have to overcome opposition from the lawyers representing local governments that sued. Those lawyers declined to sign on when presented the proposal last week.

Under the settlement framework, money for each state would be divvied up, with 15% going to the state treasury, 15% for local governments that filed lawsuits and 70% going to a proposed state fund aimed at addressing the crisis.

Boffetti predicted it would takes weeks for states to determine whether they back the settlement framework.

North Carolina’s attorney general, Josh Stein, acknowledged that a detailed term sheet needs to be developed.

“There are a lot of details and mechanics that need to be added to it,” Stein told Reuters in an interview. “That will happen in the coming weeks.”

The proposal did win a major supporter on Tuesday. Tom Miller of Iowa, the longest-serving attorney general, publicly backed the proposal, calling the framework “an important step in addressing the crisis.”

Colorado’s attorney general, Phil Weiser, called it a “very promising development.”

The lawsuits accuse distributors of failing to flag and halt a rising tide of suspicious orders and drugmakers of overstating the benefits of opioids while downplaying the risks.

The companies have denied any wrongdoing. Drugmakers say their products carried government-approved labels that warned of the addictive risks of opioids, while distributors argue their role was to make sure medicines prescribed by licensed doctors were available for patients.

The proposed deal has widened a fault line between attorneys general and local governments.

Cities and counties generally hired private attorneys to bring their cases, and attorneys general want to limit the amount of the settlement that goes to pay private lawyers. The attorneys for local governments also generally opposed Teva contributing opioid treatment drugs to the settlement, instead of cash, in part because of concerns that the framework placed an inflated value on those drugs.

Last week’s talks failed to reach a global deal, and on Monday, the three wholesale distributors and Teva struck a last-minute $260 million settlement with two Ohio counties, averting the first federal trial over opioids.

North Carolina’s Stein said he looked forward to resolving concerns about the proposal and warned that settling lawsuits individually was unsustainable.

“If we proceed on the current path and each county and city brings their case and extracts whatever amount they may be able to get from these companies, the companies will end up bankrupt,” he said. “The opioid crisis is a national problem that demands a national solution.”", Several states wary of $48 billion opioid settlement proposal ,10-2019
"(Reuters) - Several U.S. states that have been ravaged by the opioid epidemic are pushing back on a proposed $48 billion settlement framework that would resolve thousands of lawsuits against five drug companies accused of fueling the addiction crisis.

The proposal would bring an end to all opioid litigation against AmerisourceBergen Corp(ABC.N), Cardinal Health Inc(CAH.N) and McKesson Corp(MCK.N), drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Inc(TEVA.TA)(TEVA.N), and Johnson & JohnsonJNJ.J.

The companies have proposed paying $22.25 billion cash mostly over 18 years, while services and drugs to treat addiction valued at $26 billion by the companies would be provided over the coming decade, mostly by Teva.

Officials in states such as Ohio, New Hampshire and West Virginia — all hard hit by the deadly drug addition crisis — voiced concerns about the proposal.

James Boffetti, the associate attorney general for New Hampshire, said in an interview he was troubled that payments were stretched over many years.

“The concern is, I think, the states need money now to create the infrastructure for treatment,” he said.

Small states fear the money will be divvied up by population rather than need.

“Any global opioid settlement that doesn’t reflect the unique and unprecedented damage imposed on West Virginia through the opioid epidemic should be DOA,” West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said on Twitter on Tuesday.

Some 400,000 U.S. overdose deaths between 1997 and 2017 were linked to opioids, according to government data. Roughly 2,600 lawsuits have been brought nationwide by states, local and tribal governments.

The three distributors in a joint statement said they were committed to finalizing a global settlement and would continue working with the other parties on the details of the framework. Teva declined to comment.
