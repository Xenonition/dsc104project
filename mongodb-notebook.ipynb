The rest of 2019 was less lofty.\\n\\nIt was a year of grinding politics. A rookie Democratic-controlled State Legislature went through a jam-packed and sometimes chaotic legislative session, from overdue voting changes to complicated criminal justice reforms. Local fraud and abuse continued as usual, with the convictions of former Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano and former Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota.\\n\\nAll the while, Washington was a tempest, with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election coming and going. White House scandals and travesties popped from the Mexican border to Ukraine.\\n\\nUltimately, 2019 saw just the third impeachment of an American president.\\n\\nThere were devastating storms over the Bahamas and fires in California as climate change created havoc around the globe. The world seemed to spiral, with protests in Hong Kong and authoritarian or populist movements gaining steam from India to Eastern Europe to Britain. American troops continued to fight and die in the Middle East, as the truth about the long war in Afghanistan only continued to come out.\\n\\nThere were bright spots. Yankee great Mariano Rivera was unanimously voted into baseball’s Hall of Fame, and the U.S. Women’s soccer team dominated the World Cup. Even Congress made the belated promise to care for 9/11 first responders permanent.\\n\\nThose good moments can be hard to clock. With a presidential election coming, time will only speed up. But some things endure, like that New Horizons mission. The spacecraft is still transmitting data from the January flyby.

Tuesday could bring more bad news due to the state`s quirky election rules, Republicans could end up without a candidate for senator or governor in the fall elections.\n",

      "And that could cause trouble for other GOP candidates around the state. In most states, the primary election narrows down the field to one Democrat and one Republican.

      "\n",
      "That means incumbent Democratic Senator, Dianne Feinstein could face Democratic State Senator, Kevin De Leon, rather than a Republican. Republicans may be shut out in the governor`s race as well. GOP businessman man, John Cox has President Trump`s endorsement, but he may wind up in third place. That would lead two Democrats, former San Francisco Mayor, Gavin Newsom, and former Los Angeles Mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa to battle it out in the fall.\n",

      "Without Republican candidates at the top of the ticket, conservative voters may not show up on election day.

      "\n",
      "The move was the latest sign that establishment Democrats are facing something of a national insurgence, coming on the heels of last month`s shock win by 28-year-old Democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over high-ranking Rep. Joe Crowley in a closely watched New York primary.\n",
      "\n",
      "In backing de Leon, a majority of the party`s 360-member executive board ignored Feinstein`s calls to stay neutral in the race. Her allies had warned an endorsement would only further divide Democrats.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final vote margin was lopsided: A total of 217 delegates voted for de Leon, of Los Angeles, or nearly 65 percent of the delegates. Meanwhile, only 22, or 7 percent, cast ballots for Feinstein and 94, or nearly 30 percent, voted for no endorsement.\n",

      "\n",
      "Party members and activists are typically more liberal than the wider California electorate that has sent Feinstein to Washington five times. Feinstein has turned skepticism from some party activists into an asset in her past campaigns.\n",

      "\n",
      "California runs a top-two primary system that sends the two highest primary vote-getters to the general election regardless of party. The system allowed de Leon to take the No. 2 spot by squeaking past a slew of unknown Republicans in the primary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six U.S. House candidates for seats considered top Democratic targets joined Feinstein`s call for neutrality in a letter to members before the vote on Saturday.\n",
