      "\n",
      ">> President`s choice.>> Republicans in California are on the ropes, bracing for a possible shutout at the top of the ticket in primary elections on Tuesday. I`m Andy Sullivan in San Francisco, perhaps the most liberal city in the state where Republicans have been pushed to the margins. Tuesday could bring more bad news due to the state`s quirky election rules, Republicans could end up without a candidate for senator or governor in the fall elections.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that could cause trouble for other GOP candidates around the state. In most states, the primary election narrows down the field to one Democrat and one Republican. But in California`s so-called jungle primary, it`s the top two vote-getters in any given race who face each other in November, even if they`re from the same party.\n",
      "\n",
      "That means incumbent Democratic Senator, Dianne Feinstein could face Democratic State Senator, Kevin De Leon, rather than a Republican. Republicans may be shut out in the governor`s race as well. GOP businessman man, John Cox has President Trump`s endorsement, but he may wind up in third place. That would lead two Democrats, former San Francisco Mayor, Gavin Newsom, and former Los Angeles Mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa to battle it out in the fall.\n",
