"“It’s really about dignity, because we’ve been fighting for so long,” said tribal chairman Gerald Gray, who tracked the bill’s final steps from a meeting of Native American leaders in Billings. “It’s righting a wrong.”

AD

The long and fragmented history of the Little Shell, known for decades as Montana’s landless Native Americans, now can move forward with a more cohesive future. Members will have access to funding and programs like the Indian Health Services, plus a tract of their own land — a reservation, not even one square mile, in a yet-to-be determined spot — with the potential for amenities like a tribal college.

AD

For Gray and others who don’t have health insurance because it’s too expensive, the details will be critically important. “There are a lot of members in this situation,” he said.

But the significance of this week’s action goes far beyond the obvious, tangible benefits, which probably will require lengthy negotiations with the government. Many individuals have painful personal stories to tell about stigma.

AD

Colleen Hill, who grew up in the central Montana city of Great Falls, the de facto home base of the Little Shell, believes federal recognition as a tribe will alter the lives of future generations. Her mother fought for the tribe’s rights decades ago, and she has done the same as a tribal council member.

“One thing that it’s going to help with is our identity,” Hill said. “For the Little Shell people, there’s a lot of us who felt like you didn’t know where you belonged. It won’t be a continual fight to prove we’re Indian or where we came from.”

The tribe’s modern story began in what is now North Dakota in the late 1800s, when Chief Little Shell ended treaty negotiations with the federal government. Left without land, most tribe members became nomadic and scattered across the Plains region.

Today, the tribe owns three acres northwest of Great Falls, with a cultural center on a site known as “Hill 57.” The location, once home to hundreds of Little Shell, became synonymous in Montana with urban poverty. Some in the tribe hope their future reservation might be placed there, a tribute to the past.

For tribal members, part of their struggle has been against two worlds that considered them outsiders — not just white society but Native Americans with reservations of their own.

“ ‘You’re not a real Indian unless you grew up on the reservation’ is a common thing,” said Little Shell member Chris LaTray, a Missoula-based writer. “A lot of us grew up off reservation.”

LaTray, 52, who was raised in Frenchtown just outside Missoula, says his father denied being Native American while his grandparents told him that they were Chippewa.

“I didn’t hear Little Shell up until a decade ago, which was not uncommon among members,” LaTray said.

The irony of a Native American nation’s existence being tucked into the National Defense Authorization Act, the funding mechanism for military forces that once worked to eradicate them, has not gone unnoticed. And for LaTray, it’s particularly galling to finally be recognized by a president who is separating migrant families at the border, in the same manner Native American families were once separated. Still, members are pragmatic about what it all means looking ahead.

With their federal recognition, the Little Shell join the 573 other Indian nations eligible for funding or services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Entry into this world is not easy; attempts to carve out a place for the Little Shell have failed repeatedly since the 1940s. Overall, fewer than 20 tribes have been recognized by the BIA since the 1970s, and six of those were Virginia groups added in just the last year.

For the Little Shell, the long road to this week’s action began at home in Montana. The state afforded the tribe recognition in 2000. That turned the tide for many members in terms of reversing stigma and gaining respect, said Leona Kienenberger, 78, who lives in eastern Montana.

“After my grandparents and my parents fought so many years for this, it’s important,” she explained.

AD

AD

Yet the effort has lost many along the way, including Little Shell historian Nicholas Vrooman, an adopted tribal member who died this year.

“Nicolas used to say, ‘This is a tribe that literally, until very recently, funded its operations with bake sales,’ ” LaTray recounted.

The final push in Congress was bipartisan, led by all three members of the state’s congressional delegation — Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat, and his two Republican colleagues, Sen. Steve Daines and Rep. Greg Gianforte. And at a ceremony in Helena on Friday, Gov. Steve Bullock (D) announced that the tribe’s flag would fly atop the state Capitol. He called on all Montanans to honor “the strength, endurance and tenacity of the Little Shell people.”

AD

The services that will follow could cost $41 million over five years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, although its estimate this March accounted for only some 2,600 tribal members.

AD

Kevin Washburn, a scholar of Native American law and a former assistant secretary for Indian affairs, said they earned their place among the nation’s recognized tribal nations.

“The best evidence that the Little Shell Band is legitimate and deserving of federal recognition is the sheer persistence of its leadership. Persistence is the single most important trait of any tribal nation in the United States,” Washburn noted Monday.

“I have always told my law students that persistence is the most important trait of American Indians,” he continued. “If our ancestors had lacked that, we would have been wiped from the earth long ago.”

AD", A big moment finally comes for the Little Shell: Federal recognition of their tribe ,12-2019
"Trump made 22 of the false claims at a campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania. He made 16 of them in a lengthy exchange with reporters during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.

The economy was Trump`s top subject of dishonesty, with 25 false claims. He made 22 false claims about military affairs, largely on account of his presence at a NATO summit. He made 15 false claims about NATO itself, 11 about impeachment.

Trump is now averaging 63 false claims per week since we started counting at CNN on July 8, 2019. He made 38 false claims last week, 61 the week before.

He is now up to 1,450 total false claims since July 8. A breakdown of the lowlights from the last two weeks:

The most egregious false claim: An imaginary restraining order

Trump has no shortage of factual ammunition for bashing former FBI senior counterintelligence official Peter Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who exchanged anti-Trump texts while being involved in the investigation into the Trump campaign`s relationship with Russia (and while having an affair).

But Trump is rarely satisfied with accurate attacks when he can do more damage to his foes` reputations with inaccurate ones. At his December 10 campaign rally in Pennsylvania, he alleged that one of either Strzok or Page had obtained a restraining order against the other.

Most presidents try to limit their public storytelling to stories they know to be accurate. Not Trump, an eager purveyor of rumor and insinuation, he told the crowd: ""I don`t know if it`s true. The fake news will never report it. But it could be true. No, that`s what I heard, I don`t know.""

There is not a hint of evidence that the story is true. Page tweeted that it was a ""lie.""

The most revealing false claim: An assault in Maryland

Trump comes to many of his rally speeches armed with graphic accounts of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. At the Pennsylvania rally, he recited accurate details of a horrifying recent Maryland case during which a man allegedly strangled and raped a woman who was trying to enter her apartment.

Then, appearing to ad-lib for a moment, Trump said, ""She was raped and killed, strangled to death.""

The victim was not killed. Police reported that doctors said she could have been killed by the strangulation, but she survived

We might be inclined to think Trump had made an innocent error had he not done this kind of needless exaggerating before. At one event last year, for example, he began to read out his text`s accurate claim that the MS-13 gang on Long Island, New Yorkhad called for the murder of a police officer, then decided to turn it into a false claim that MS-13 actually did murder the police officer.

The most absurd false claim: Rewriting campaign history

Trump`s general approach to history: if you don`t like it, rewrite it.

The Louisiana governor candidate for whom Trump campaigned hard, Eddie Rispone, lost to incumbent John Bel Edwards by 2.7 percentage points. Trump claimed twice this month that Rispone lost by less than one percentage point.

And that was not the month`s most egregious attempt to revise his political past. At the NATO summit, Trump told reporters that, with the exception of that race in Louisiana and another governor`s race in Kentucky, ""I`ve won virtually every race that I`ve participated in.""

""Virtually"" is vague, but Trump was wrong however you slice things. He was omitting the defeats of two Alabama Senate candidates he had touted at rallies in 2017, a Virginia governor candidate he had repeatedly tweeted to promote in 2017, and a Pennsylvania congressional candidate and Montana and West Virginia Senate candidates he had promoted at rallies in 2018.

Here`s the full list of 99 false claims, starting with the new ones we haven`t previously included in one of these roundups:

Foreign and military affairs

The Turkey-Syria border

""We pulled our soldiers out and we said, `You can patrol your own border now. I don`t care who you do it with, but we`re not going to have soldiers patrolling the border that`s been fought over for 2,000 years.`"" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron

""And I read a couple of stories just two days ago that, `Wow, that deal that Trump did with Turkey` -- because I want to get our soldiers out of there. I don`t want to be policing a border that`s been fought over for 2,000 years."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

Facts First: There is no basis for the claim that there has been fighting over the Turkey-Syria border for 2,000 years; modern-day Turkey and Syria were both part of the Ottoman Empire that was only dissolved after World War, and the border between them is less than 100 years old.

""The border he refers to -- the Turkish-Syria border -- was established in 1923 with the Treaty of Lausanne and the founding of the Republic of Turkey. The exception to this is the province of Hatay, which passed from Syrian to Turkish control following a referendum,"" said Lisel Hintz, assistant professor of international relations and European studies at Johns Hopkins, who called Trump`s claims ""patently and irresponsibly false."" Of the current conflict between Turkey and Kurdish groups based in Turkey and in Syria, Hintz added, ""Not only have these groups not been fighting over a border for 2,000 years, none of these groups or even the border in question existed 200 years ago.""

Augusta University history professor Michael Bishku said ""Trump is totally incorrect with his history.""

Germany`s military spending

""...Germany is paying 1 to 1.2% -- at max, 1.2% -- of a much smaller GDP. That`s not fair."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

Facts First: Trump`s ""max"" figure for Germany`s defense spending was out of date. While Germany did spend 1.24% its gross domestic product (GDP) on defense in 2018, according to NATO : Trump`s ""max"" figure for Germany`s defense spending was out of date. While Germany did spend 1.24% its gross domestic product (GDP) on defense in 2018, according to NATO figures , Chancellor Angela Merkel`s government increased defense spending in 2019 to an estimated 1.38% of GDP, according to NATO -- still shy of the alliance`s 2% target, but higher than Trump said.

Trump might have simply been unaware of the German increase, but it also appeared in NATO`s official report in June. (At that point, the alliance estimated that Germany would be at 1.36% of GDP this year.)

Military spending by NATO members, part 1

On 10 separate instances, Trump made inaccurate claims about increases in military spending by NATO members. He claimed that: 1) He ""got NATO countries to pay 530 Billion Dollars a year more."" 2) This increase in NATO spending will recur on an annual basis. 3) The increase will be $400 billion in ""three years.""

Facts First: Trump was inaccurate in all three ways. NATO says that, by 2024, non-US members will have spent a total of $400 billion more on defense than they did in 2016 -- not that they will be spending $400 billion more ""a year."" Trump`s math was faulty when he added the $130 billion current increase over 2016 levels to the $400 billion increase expected by 2024; the $400 billion figure includes the $130 billion. And, again, the $400 billion increase is expected by 2024, not in ""three years.""

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg explained during a meeting with Trump on December 3 that non-US NATO members have added a total of $130 billion to their defense budgets since 2016. By 2024, Stoltenberg said, ""this number will increase to $400 billion.""

NATO has made clear in public documents and statements that the $400 billion figure represents the planned cumulative spending increase for non-US members since 2016; NATO is not saying that these countries will be spending $400 billion more every year, as Trump suggested. NATO spokesman Matthias Eichenlaub pointed CNN to November comments in which Stoltenberg said that the $400 billion was an ""accumulated increase in defense spending by the end of 2024.""

We won`t call Trump wrong when he takes credit for the spending increases, since Stoltenberg himself has repeatedly given him credit , but it`s worth noting that non-US members began boosting their defense budgets following Russia`s 2014 annexation of Ukraine`s Crimea and a 2014 NATO recommitment to the alliance`s target of having each member spend 2% of Gross Domestic Product on defense.

Military spending by NATO members, part 2

""In the 3 decades before my election, NATO spending declined by two-thirds..."" -- December 2 tweet

Facts First: There are numerous possible ways to interpret Trump`s vague claim, but we could not find any way to parse the data that resulted in a finding that ""NATO spending declined by two-thirds"" over the three decades prior to Trump`s election in 2016. Neither could two experts we asked to delve into the numbers.

""Short answer, this tweet makes no sense to me, and I don`t see any evidence backing up this `decline by two thirds` business,"" said Timothy Andrews Sayle, author of the book Enduring Alliance: A History of NATO and the Postwar Global Order and an assistant professor of history and director of the international relations program at the University of Toronto.

Expert Pieter Wezeman, senior researcher in the arms and military expenditure program at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, noted that Trump might have been closer to correct had he said that the share of gross domestic product that European NATO members spent on defense declined by two-thirds in the three decades before his election. According to official NATO data , European NATO members were spending an average of 3.7% GDP on defense between 1980 and 1984 and 3.5% in 1986; the figure had dropped to about 1.5% in 2016, a reduction at least in the general vicinity of ""two-thirds.""

But, again, Trump did not say the more-accurate version of the claim. And when you crunch the actual military spending by NATO members in various ways -- we won`t delve into all of the possible ways the experts said Trump`s comment could be interpreted -- there was nowhere near a two-thirds decline, both experts found.

Accounting for inflation, official NATO data shows a decline well under one-third in military spending by non-US members between 1989, as the Cold War with the Soviet Union neared an end, and 2016. (NATO noted that additional countries were added to the alliance over that period, so it is not an apples-to-apples comparison.) Wezeman analyzed the data using only the NATO countries that were part of the alliance in 1986 and still found an inflation-adjusted decrease of well under one-third.

CNN`s coverage of Middle East protests

Trump said that, after he announced in 2017 that he would move the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, ""A day went by, and a second day went by, and there was no violence. I heard there was going to be massive violence. They showed violence -- because about 20 people were violent in the front row, but there was nobody behind them. So CNN had the cameras very low, pointing to the sky ... They said, `Massive crowds have gathered. Massive crowds.` And I looked, I said, `That`s a strange angle. I`ve never seen that angle.` It was like -- you had a cameraman sitting on the floor pointing up. But every once in a while, you say, `There`s nobody behind the people in the front row. What`s going on?` And it was a con. It was fake news as usual."" -- December 7 speech to the Israeli American Council National Summit

Facts First: CNN`s coverage of these 2017 protests did not use deceptive camera angles or exaggerate the size of the crowds. (FactCheck.org, which conducted its own : CNN`s coverage of these 2017 protests did not use deceptive camera angles or exaggerate the size of the crowds. (FactCheck.org, which conducted its own in-depth review of CNN`s coverage, also found no evidence for Trump`s claims.)

It is possible Trump was referring to a CNN report from the West Bank on December 7, 2017, the day after Trump`s announcement about the embassy. The camera bobbed upward and downward during the last portion of segment -- but only because the photojournalist carrying the camera was running from tear gas being used by Israeli forces.

CNN reporter Ian Lee, who now works for CBS, said in the report that ""you are seeing a lot of people go out in the street and voice their anger,"" but Lee did not describe the crowds as ""massive."" CNN`s article on the day`s protests, written by Lee and two others, included the following sentences: ""Speaking in Jerusalem, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told CNN that protests there were relatively small and had been largely contained. `We`ve dealt with much larger, both in terms of number, scale, size, seriousness of incidents.`""

In a December 12, 2017, report on subsequent West Bank protests, CNN senior international correspondent Arwa Damon said, ""The number of Palestinians who have taken to the streets remains, relatively speaking, low."" She said that the clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces were ""in fact, a little muted, at least by what the expectations were.""

Trump is correct that there was not major violence at protests immediately following his December 2017 announcement, but there was at protests on the day the Jerusalem embassy was officially opened in May 2018. The New York Times reported that day: ""By late in the evening, 58 Palestinians, including several teenagers, had been killed and more than 1,350 wounded by gun fire, the (Israeli) Health Ministry said. Israeli soldiers and snipers used barrages of tear gas as well as live gunfire to keep protesters from entering Israeli territory. The Israeli military said that some in the crowds were planting or hurling explosives, and that many were flying flaming kites into Israel; at least one kite outside the Nahal Oz kibbutz, near Gaza City, ignited a wildfire.""

Impeachment

Adam Schiff`s comments and defamation law

""This guy is sick. He made up the conversation. He lied. If he didn`t do that in the halls of Congress, he`d be thrown into jail. But he did it in the halls of Congress, and he`s given immunity."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

Facts First: Trump was correct that Rep. Adam Schiff : Trump was correct that Rep. Adam Schiff has legal immunity under the Constitution for comments he made at a House committee meeting in September about Trump`s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. (We`ve written that those comments were at least confusing .) However, Trump was wrong when he said Schiff would be ""thrown into jail"" if he had made these comments outside of Congress.

Let`s temporarily set aside the question of the accuracy or inaccuracy of Schiff`s remarks. Apart the fact that it would be exceedingly unusual for an elected official to be criminally prosecuted for offering a rendition of the President`s comments, even an inaccurate rendition, there is no law under which Schiff might conceivably be charged: as PolitiFact noted , there is no criminal defamation law in Washington, D.C. (where Schiff was speaking), in California (Schiff`s home state), or in federal law.

A quote from Fox News, part 1

""`The Democrats haven`t come up with a smocking (sic.) gun. Nancy Pelosi, by raising this to the level of Impeachment, has raised the bar impossibly high. This comes after three years of nonstop investigations of Trump, the Russian collusion narrative, the Mueller Report, & now the American people are supposed to believe that this simply isn`t a part of everthing (sic.) they`ve been trying to do for the last three years? I think it is really a hard sell for Nancy Pelosi.` @DanHenninger The Wall Street Journal."" -- December 8 tweet

Facts First: Trump omitted the portion of Henninger`s : Trump omitted the portion of Henninger`s comments on Fox News in which Henninger said things less favorable to Trump -- such as that the House of Representatives could have voted to censure him for trying to get Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden. In between the sentences Trump quoted, Henninger said, ""Everyone can agree or disagree about the rightness or wrongness of what Donald Trump did with the president of Ukraine, intervening, trying to get him to investigate Joe Biden. And indeed that`s a voteable issue; voters can make up their minds about that, and indeed the House could have voted to censure Donald Trump, the will of the House being that this is wrong.""

We give Trump significant latitude to make errors when quoting people on television, but we call it a false claim when he alters the meaning of the quote with major changes or omissions.

A quote from Fox News, part 2

""`The American people are going to see this for what it is. It is a political effort by the Democrats, and the President certainly doesn`t have to aid in the Impeachment effort.` Robert Ray @MariaBartiromo"" -- December 2 tweet

Facts First: Trump again omitted an unfavorable and significant part of the quote. This time, he left out Ray saying that Democrats may (or may not) be correct that impeachment will help their chances in the 2020 election.

Here`s what Ray said on Fox News, with the key Trump omission in italics: ""I think the American people are going to see this for what it is. I think they do understand at bottom that this is a political effort. The Democrats have made a calculation that this is their best way forward in order to maximize their chances in the 2020 election. They may be right or they may be wrong about that, that remains to be seen. But the President certainly doesn`t have to aid in the Impeachment effort.""

Elections

The Louisiana governor race

""And after getting them into a runoff, he picked up 14 points because they thought he was going to lose to a popular governor -- John Bel Edwards. Good guy. Popular governor. He almost won. He lost by less than a point."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

""And Louisiana was a long shot. It was less than 1%. He came up 12 or 14 points -- a lot."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

Facts First: Republican Eddie Rispone lost the Louisiana governor race to Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards by : Republican Eddie Rispone lost the Louisiana governor race to Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards by about 2.7 percentage points , 51.33% to 48.67%, not by ""less than a point"" or ""less than 1%.""

(In addition, Trump`s claim that Rispone had gained 12 or 14 points is highly questionable. Trump may have been referring to a single poll, a month before the vote, that had Rispone down 16 points, but most polls had the race in the single digits.)

Trump`s campaign history

""But with the exception of those two races (in Louisiana and Kentucky), where I had a huge impact because I raised them up almost to victory and they had no chance -- with the exception of those two, I`ve won virtually every race that I`ve participated in."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

Facts First: Though many of the Republican candidates for whom Trump has campaigned have gone on to win, it`s not true that Trump has won ""virtually every race"" in which he has participated. The following candidates were all defeated after Trump touted them at campaign rallies: Alabama Republican Senate primary candidate : Though many of the Republican candidates for whom Trump has campaigned have gone on to win, it`s not true that Trump has won ""virtually every race"" in which he has participated. The following candidates were all defeated after Trump touted them at campaign rallies: Alabama Republican Senate primary candidate Luther Strange in 2017, Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore in 2017 after he beat Strange in the primary, Pennsylvania Republican congressional candidate Rick Saccone in 2018, Montana Republican Senate candidate Matt Rosendale in 2018 and West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey in 2018.

Virginia Republican governor candidate Ed Gillespie also lost in 2017 after Trump tweeted repeatedly to promote him.

The Mueller investigation

""An overthrow of government""

""This was an overthrow of government. This was an attempted overthrow. And a lot of people who were in on it, and they got caught. They got caught red-handed."" -- December 9 remarks at roundtable on school choice

Facts First: There is no evidence that the FBI`s investigation into the Trump campaign`s relationship with Russia was an ""attempted overthrow"" of Trump.

Michael Horowitz, inspector general for the Justice Department, found ""basic and fundamental errors"" in the FBI`s handling of applications for surveillance of former Trump campaign foreign policy aide Carter Page under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Horowitz emphasized the seriousness of these mistakes in his December report and congressional testimony.

But Horowitz did not find evidence that the department or the FBI in particular were attempting some sort of coup -- nor even that there had been intentional misconduct. Horowitz found that the FBI had a legitimate basis to open the investigation into the Trump campaign`s relationship with Russia and that the decisions to investigate the campaign and individual campaign aides were not driven by political bias.

During Horowitz`s congressional testimony, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal asked him, ""Is there any evidence that you found that the FBI tried to overthrow the president?"" Horowitz responded, ""No, we found the issues we identified here. That`s what we found."" When Blumenthal said, ""I didn`t find any conclusion that the FBI meddled or interfered in the election to affect the outcome,"" Horowitz replied, ""We did not reach that conclusion.""

Peter Strzok and Lisa Page

Mocking former FBI lawyer Lisa Page and former FBI senior counterintelligence official Peter Strzok, who had an affair while working together, Trump said, ""This poor guy -- did I hear he needed a restraining order after this whole thing, to keep him away from Lisa? That`s what I heard. I don`t know if it`s true. The fake news will never report it. But it could be true. No, that`s what I heard, I don`t know."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: There is no evidence that either Strzok or Page ever obtained or sought a restraining order against the other. Page : There is no evidence that either Strzok or Page ever obtained or sought a restraining order against the other. Page said on Twitter: ""This is a lie. Nothing like this ever happened.""

Immigration

Deportations to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador

""And Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador -- we signed a very important agreement with each. When their people come into our country, they weren`t taking them back. Now they take them back and they say, thank you very much. They weren`t taking them back. If we had a murderer from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, we want to bring them back -- under past administrations, they bring them, they said, `We don`t want them. Don`t land your plane with us.` They say, `Thank you very much. We will take them back.` Because we`ve let them know the price is very bad if they don`t do that."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

Facts First: Trump was mixing up two separate issues. While the Trump administration does have : Trump was mixing up two separate issues. While the Trump administration does have new agreements with all three countries, those agreements are related to the handling of people who come to the US seeking asylum, not criminals the US is seeking to deport. In 2016, just prior to Trump`s presidency, none of the three countries was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered ""recalcitrant"" (uncooperative) in accepting the return of their citizens from the US.

Randy Capps, director of research for US programs at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington think tank, confirmed that Trump was ""confusing"" different things. Capps said Trump was ""way off base"" on this claim.

Capps noted that in the 2016 fiscal year, the last full year before Trump took office, ICE reported that Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador ranked second, third and fourth for the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. The same was true in the 2017 fiscal year , which encompassed the end of Barack Obama`s presidency and the beginning of Trump`s. ICE did not identify any widespread problems with deportations to these countries.

In July 2016, ICE deputy director Daniel Ragsdale testified to Congress that there were some exceptions to the rule: ""It is important to note that while countries may generally be cooperative, sometimes they may delay or refuse the repatriation of certain individuals. For example, El Salvador, a country that is generally cooperative, has recently delayed the issuance of a number of travel documents where there is no legal impediment to removal.""

So Trump could have accurately made a less sweeping claim. But he was exaggerating when he declared that the three countries simply ""weren`t taking them back.""

An arrest in Maryland

""Since Montgomery County, Maryland declared itself a sanctuary jurisdiction in July, we have already identified nine illegal aliens who have been arrested for rape, sexual assault, including a 26-year-old man charged with raping and viciously strangling a young, wonderful woman, who was entering her apartment, innocently entering her apartment. She was raped and killed, strangled to death."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: The victim in this August case was not killed. The Washington Post : The victim in this August case was not killed. The Washington Post reported that the victim ""was taken to a hospital for her injuries. Police said in a statement that `doctors advised detectives that the severity of the strangulation the victim suffered could have resulted in her death.`""

Trump was correct that nine undocumented immigrants have been charged with rape or sexual assault in this Maryland county since July, according to local media reports and a September tweet from Ken Cuccinelli, acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

Democrats

Beto O`Rourke and religion

""We had one candidate who turned out not to be too good a candidate, right? Beto. Beto. Remember? So he wanted to get rid of religion -- the Bible."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Unsuccessful Democratic presidential candidate Beto O`Rourke, the former Texas congressman, never proposed to ""get rid of religion"" or the Bible.

O`Rourke sparked controversy by proposing to strip tax-exempt status from religious institutions, including churches, that oppose same-sex marriage. O`Rourke said ""there can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break"" for any entity ""that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us.""

Trump is free to criticize O`Rourke`s proposal as a violation of the First Amendment, but it`s a major exaggeration to claim that proposing to strip certain churches` tax exemptions is the same as proposing to eradicate religion or the Bible.

Elizabeth Warren`s wealth tax

""You`re not going to vote for Pocahontas, I can tell you that. You`re not going to vote for the wealth tax. `Yeah, let`s take 100% of your wealth away.`"" -- December 7 speech to the Israeli American Council National Summit

Facts First: Warren is not proposing to take away 100% of anyone`s wealth. Her wealth tax : Warren is not proposing to take away 100% of anyone`s wealth. Her wealth tax proposal is for ""an annual 2% tax on every dollar of net worth above $50 million and a 6% tax on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion.""

Elizabeth Warren`s health care plan

""Her ridiculous plan would cost $52 trillion. That`s more money than we take in in one year, two years, three years, four years, five years, six years -- about seven years. That`s for one year, $52 trillion."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Warren`s campaign says her Medicare-for-All proposal would require a total of $52 trillion in health care spending : Warren`s campaign says her Medicare-for-All proposal would require a total of $52 trillion in health care spending over 10 years , not one year. (The Urban Institute think tank estimates that $52 trillion is also the amount that would be spent on health care under current law.) Trump is free to question the Warren campaign`s financial assumptions, but $52 trillion for one year is inaccurate.

Trump was also inaccurate when he suggested that $52 trillion is ""about seven years"" worth of federal revenue. The federal government took in $3.3 trillion in 2018; at that level, $52 trillion would actually represent about 16 years` worth of federal receipts. Trump might have been attempting to refer to how Warren`s proposal would require $20.5 trillion in new spending by the federal government over the next decade; that is roughly six years of federal revenues at the present level, so Trump would be much closer to correct.

Warren has proposed a variety of ways to generate the $20.5 trillion, including higher taxes on wealthy people, increased corporate taxes, improved tax enforcement, new employer fees, and new payments from state and local governments.

Trump was asked about the Dow falling 400 points early that day, December 3, in apparent response to comments he made earlier in the day about the state of trade talks with China. He responded, ""Well it`s up -- let me tell you. We took it up -- it was about at 16,000 or 15,000. And now it`s almost at 30,000. It`s gonna be at 30,000."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

Facts First: The Dow has increased by more than a third during Trump`s presidency, but he was exaggerating where it started. The Dow opened (and closed) just under 20,000 points on the day of his inauguration, not at 15,000 or 16,000. If you go back to the day of his election, as Trump prefers to do, the Dow was over 18,000 points.

The Dow closed over 27,000 on December 3.

November jobs expectations

""The numbers came out, as you saw on Friday, with a number of jobs that nobody believed possible: 200 -- well over 200,000. They were thinking about 50. Some people thought it would be 50,000, 60,000."" -- December 9 remarks at roundtable on school choice

""It was announced that 266,000 jobs were added in November. And that shattered all expectations. They were thinking about 70,000. They were thinking about 90,000 -- which isn`t so bad. Two hundred and sixty-six thousand."" -- December 7 speech to the Israeli American Council National Summit/

""Just last week, we announced that we smashed expectations and created 266,000 jobs in November -- a number that was unthinkable a day before. A day before, they were guessing, `Would it be 80? Would it be 90? Would it be 160?` Somebody said -- an optimist. And this was 266,000..."" -- December 12 speech at White House Summit on Child Care and Paid Leave

Facts First: While the number of jobs added by the US economy in November, 266,000, did exceed analysts` expectations, those expectations were much higher than Trump claimed. The : While the number of jobs added by the US economy in November, 266,000, did exceed analysts` expectations, those expectations were much higher than Trump claimed. The median estimate from economists surveyed by Reuters was 180,000 jobs added -- and the lowest of the economists` estimates was 120,000 jobs added. (So one of Trump`s many figures, the ""160,000,"" does fall within the range of estimates.)

Trump did not specify who he was talking about when he repeatedly referred to an unnamed ""they""; it is certainly plausible that somebody somewhere thought that a mere 50,000, 60,000, 70,000, 80,000 or 90,000 jobs would be added. But Trump created the impression that he was talking about the expectations of economic experts.

The currencies of Brazil and Argentina

""Brazil and Argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies. which is not good for our farmers. Therefore, effective immediately, I will restore the Tariffs on all Steel & Aluminum that is shipped into the U.S. from those countries. The Federal Reserve should likewise act so that countries, of which there are many, no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies."" -- December 2 tweet

Facts First: While the Brazilian real and the Argentinian peso had : While the Brazilian real and the Argentinian peso had declined against the US dollar in the weeks prior to Trump`s announcement, and for the year, experts say there was no evidence either country had been intentionally devaluing either currency. To the contrary, ""the evidence shows that Argentina and Brazil have been trying to do the opposite of what President Trump accuses,"" said Paul Angelo, fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""In fact, this year alone the Brazilian government has repeatedly intervened to slow devaluation of the real and Argentina has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in August trying to shield the peso following a political shock .""

The Wall Street Journal reported after Trump`s announcement: ""...few economists and analysts agreed with Mr. Trump`s claim that the two countries have been manipulating their currencies...Neither Brazil nor Argentina has been featured in the U.S. Treasury Department`s currency report, the official vehicle for designating nations as manipulators."" Bloomberg reported : ""While it`s true the Brazilian real and Argentine peso have weakened against the greenback this year, policy makers in Brasilia and Buenos Aires appear worried rather than happy about this. `Trump should be thanking Brazil and Argentina,` said Andre Perfeito, chief economist at Necton, a Sao Paulo-based brokerage. `Their governments have adopted measures that seek to rein in the depreciation of their currencies.`""

Russian energy production

Claiming that Russia wishes he had lost the election, Trump said, ""We are now number one in the world in energy; Russia`s number three. We`re beating out Russia and Saudi Arabia."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Russia was second in the world in petroleum and natural gas production every year from 2014 through 2018, far exceeding the production of third-place Saudi Arabia in each of those years, according to an August : Russia was second in the world in petroleum and natural gas production every year from 2014 through 2018, far exceeding the production of third-place Saudi Arabia in each of those years, according to an August report from the US government`s Energy Information Administration. (Russia was in first place from 2008 through 2013.)

If you include ""biofuels, and refinery processing gain, among other liquid fuels"" in the count, as the Energy Information Administration did in a 2017 analysis , the US became number one in the world in 2012, not 2014. Regardless, Russia has consistently been in second place by this broader measure as well since the US became number .

No matter which measure you use, Trump`s use of the word ""now"" is arguably misleading. The US has been number one since the presidency of Barack Obama, whom Trump has repeatedly accused of perpetrating a ""war on American energy.""

The American and Chinese economies

""We`re much larger than China now, because we`ve gone up and they`ve gone down."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

Facts First: The US has not just ""now"" become a larger economy than China; that was also the case before Trump took office. And China continues to close the gap: while China`s economy is growing at its : The US has not just ""now"" become a larger economy than China; that was also the case before Trump took office. And China continues to close the gap: while China`s economy is growing at its slowest rate since 1992 , It is still reporting growth greater than that of the US.

China reported 6% economic growth in the third quarter of 2019; the US reported 2.1% third-quarter growth. China`s official figures are not always reliable, but there is no doubt that growth is occurring. In October, the International Monetary Fund predicted 6.1% growth from China in 2019 and 5.8% growth in 2020.

Global warming and the oceans

Mocking fears about global warming, Trump said, ""The ocean`s going to rise. One eighth of an inch within the next 250 years. We`re going to be wiped out!"" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Trump was greatly understating scientists` estimates of rising sea levels. Even in 80 years, the United Nations` Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change expects sea levels to rise by a foot or more.

As FactCheck.org noted , a September report from the UN panel estimated an increase in the global mean sea level by about 1 feet to 2 feet over 1986-2005 levels by 2100 -- even under a lower-carbon-emissions scenario; the report projected much higher increases in a scenario in which emissions were higher. ""Under a higher emissions scenario, the report said, 2 to 3.5 feet of sea level rise are expected,"" FactCheck.org noted. ""By 2300 -- three decades after the president`s timeframe -- sea level rise is likely to be 2 to 3.5 feet, even under lower emissions, according to the IPCC report. With higher emissions, the likely range is between a whopping 7.5 to 18 feet.""

Here are the claims Trump made over these two weeks that we have previously fact checked in one of these weekly roundups:

Ukraine and impeachment

The timing of Rep. Adam Schiff`s comments

""He made up my statement, because -- see, I did one thing very good. As soon as I heard about this deal, I released my statement immediately. But he had already made horrible statements."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Trump can reasonably criticize Schiff for Schiff`s comments at a House Intelligence Committee hearing in September; as we`ve written before, Schiff`s mix of near-quotes from Trump`s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, his own analysis, and supposed ""parody"" was at the very least confusing. But Schiff spoke the day after Trump released the rough transcript, not before Trump released the transcript.

The accuracy of the whistleblower

""By the way, the whistleblower: the whistleblower defrauded our country, because the whistleblower wrote something that was totally untrue...They wrote something totally different from what I said."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

""The whistleblower wrote a totally false statement. So it`s a fraud."" -- December 13 exchange with reporters at meeting with Paraguayan President Description Mario Abdo Benítez

Facts First: The whistleblower`s account of Trump`s call with Zelensky has largely been proven accurate. In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower`s three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. (You can read a full fact check : The whistleblower`s account of Trump`s call with Zelensky has largely been proven accurate. In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower`s three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. (You can read a full fact check here .)

The rough transcript

""They didn`t even know, probably, that we had it transcribed, professionally transcribed, word-for-word transcribed, so beautiful."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: The document released by the White House explicitly says, on the first page, that it is not an exact transcript of Trump`s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The National Security Council`s top Ukraine expert, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, testified to Congress that he tried to make edits to the document to include two things that were said on the call but not included in the document. Vindman testified that the document was ""substantively correct,"" but he made clear that it was not a verbatim account.

The whistleblower being ""gone""

""Where`s the whistleblower? He`s disappeared, he`s gone...the whistleblower is gone. He flew the coop because he reported incorrectly..."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

""But once I released it, all of a sudden the second whistleblower disappeared. The first whistleblower, who was all set to testify, he -- all of a sudden, he becomes this saint-like figure that they don`t need him anymore. The one that everybody wanted to see, including Schiff, was the whistleblower. Once I released the text of what happened -- the transcript -- that was the end. Everybody disappeared. So now there`s no informer. There`s no second whistleblower. Everybody has gone."" -- December 13 exchange with reporters at meeting with Paraguayan President Description Mario Abdo Benítez

Facts First: There is no evidence that either the first whistleblower (who filed the complaint about Trump`s dealings with Ukraine) or the second whistleblower (whose lawyers said they had firsthand information corroborating claims made by the first whistleblower) are now somehow ""gone,"" let alone that they are ""gone"" because the first whistleblower was shown to be inaccurate.

""The whistleblowers have not vanished,"" Bradley Moss, a colleague of Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the two whistleblowers, said on Twitter in October, when Trump made another version of this claim.

The first whistleblower`s lawyers, Zaid and Andrew Bakaj, wrote in the Washington Post in October: ""Because our client has no additional information about the president`s call, there is no justification for exposing their identity and all the risks that would follow.""

The existence of the second whistleblower -- who never planned to file a separate whistleblower complaint -- was revealed after Trump released the rough transcript of his call with Zelensky, not before.

European assistance to Ukraine

""The other thing nobody remembers and nobody likes to talk about -- and I talk about it all the time -- is why isn`t Germany, why isn`t France, why aren`t other European countries paying? Because we`re paying. The suckers... Why aren`t European countries paying? Why isn`t France paying a lot of money? Why is it always the United States?"" -- December 13 exchange with reporters at meeting with Paraguayan President Description Mario Abdo Benítez

Facts First: European countries, including France and Germany, have provided hundreds of millions of dollars` worth of assistance to Ukraine since Russia`s invasion in 2014.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged European ""help"" during his meeting with Trump at the United Nations in September, though he said the world`s efforts had been inadequate so far: ""And, I`m sorry, but we don`t need help; we need support. Real support. And we thank -- thank everybody, thank all of the European countries; they each help us. But we also want to have more -- more.""

You can read a full fact check here

Zelensky`s comments

""Breaking News: The President of Ukraine has just again announced that President Trump has done nothing wrong with respect to Ukraine and our interactions or calls."" -- December 2 tweet

""The Ukrainian president came out and said, very strongly, that `President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong.`"" -- December 2 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure

""I had a very, very good conversation with the head of Ukraine. And, by the way, yesterday, he came out again and reaffirmed again that we had a very, very respectful, good conversation -- that President Trump did nothing wrong."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

Facts First: Trump was : Trump was mischaracterizing Zelensky`s comments in an interview published by Time magazine. Zelensky did not say Trump ""did nothing wrong.""

Asked about ""this issue of the quid pro quo"" with regard to US military aid to Ukraine and the investigations Trump and his allies wanted, Zelensky responded, ""Look, I never talked to the President from the position of a quid pro quo. That`s not my thing."" But Zelensky continued: ""I don`t want us to look like beggars. But you have to understand. We`re at war. If you`re our strategic partner, then you can`t go blocking anything for us. I think that`s just about fairness. It`s not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.""

Trump is entitled to tout Zelensky`s statement about not talking to Trump ""from the position of a quid pro quo,"" but those words aren`t equivalent to Zelensky saying Trump did nothing wrong.

Impeachment hearings

Trump complained about an impeachment hearing that the House Judiciary Committee had scheduled, then said, ""For the hearings, we don`t get a lawyer, we don`t get any witnesses."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

Facts First: Unlike the impeachment inquiry hearings that were held in November by the House Intelligence Committee, Trump was allowed to have his lawyer participate in the House Judiciary Committee proceedings in December. Trump declined the offer to have a lawyer appear at the particular hearing he was complaining about here, during which four constitutional law scholars appeared. Also, a Republican lawyer was permitted to question witnesses at the House Intelligence Committee hearings, though Trump`s own lawyers were not.

White House counsel Pat Cipollone said in a letter to Democratic House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler that ""an invitation to an academic discussion with law professors does not begin to provide the President with any semblance of a fair process.""

Though the Democrats got to control the witness lists, since they hold the House majority, the House Intelligence Committee did hear testimony from three former officials whom Republicans had requested as witnesses: Kurt Volker, the former special representative for Ukraine; Tim Morrison, former National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia; and David Hale, undersecretary of state for political affairs.

Economy

Ivanka Trump and jobs

""Fourteen million people she`s gotten jobs for, where she would go into Walmart, she would go into our great companies and say, `They really want help. They really want you to teach them,` because the government can`t teach like the companies can teach. And companies would take a half a million people, a million people. And her goal when she started it two years ago was 500,000 jobs; she`s done over 14 million."" -- December 12 speech at White House Summit on Child Care and Paid Leave

Facts First: Ivanka Trump has obviously not ""gotten jobs for"" 14 million people. At the time, roughly 7 million jobs had been created during the entire Trump presidency.

Trump was referring to the White House`s Pledge to America`s Workers initiative, in which Ivanka Trump has sought to get companies to commit to providing ""education and training opportunities"" for workers. As of Wednesday, companies had promised to create 14.4 million opportunities -- but many of these opportunities are internal training programs, not new jobs. Also, as CNN has previously reported, many of the companies had already planned these opportunities before Ivanka Trump launched the initiative.

Unemployment

""We have the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers. We have the best numbers we`ve ever had in our country."" -- December 10 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure

Facts First: The unemployment rates for some demographic groups are at their lowest levels ""ever,"" but the overall unemployment rate is not -- though it is indeed impressively low.

The overall rate was 3.5% in November -- the lowest since 1969, with the exception of the 3.5% rate in September, but well above the record 2.5% set in 1953.

Unemployment for women

In two separate instances, Trump said that women`s unemployment is ""at a record number"" and that it is ""the lowest in 71 years.""

Facts First: The unemployment rate for women was not a ""record,"" nor the lowest in ""71 years."" It had been 66 years, not 71 years, since the women`s unemployment rate has been as low as it was in November, : The unemployment rate for women was not a ""record,"" nor the lowest in ""71 years."" It had been 66 years, not 71 years, since the women`s unemployment rate has been as low as it was in November, 3.5% . (That`s if you ignore the 3.4% in September and April.)

The steel industry

""And the steel companies are doing incredibly well. They were finished."" And ""...they were ready to close up -- all of them -- and now they`re doing great."" -- December 9 remarks at roundtable on school choice

""But the steel industry, in particular, was -- we weren`t going to have a steel industry...Everything was closing down."" -- December 6 remarks at roundtable on small business and red tape

Facts First: The US steel industry was not ""finished"" before Trump imposed his tariffs on imported steel, nor was ""everything"" shutting down. While some American steel companies were struggling, not ""all of them"" were anywhere close to closing. In fact, some major companies were thriving.

Bloomberg reported in an October 2018 fact check: ""In fact, U.S. steelmakers Nucor Corp. and Steel Dynamics Inc. were two of the healthiest commodity companies in the world before Trump took office.""

There is no doubt that the steel industry had declined from its heyday: the number of people working in iron and steel mills or in making steel products fell from more than 250,000 in 1990 to under 150,000 by 2016. Still, ""finished"" is an exaggeration. In 2016 , the US produced about as much raw steel as it did at various points in the 1980s.

Steel plants

""And now the steel industry -- if you look at what`s going on, the industry is doing incredibly well. They`re building a lot of extensions. They`re building brand-new plants where they never...they never built a new plant. I mean, they hadn`t built one in years, and now they`re building new plants all over the country."" -- December 6 remarks at roundtable on small business and red tape

Facts First: While some steel plants were closing, being idled or otherwise doing poorly before Trump took office and before Trump imposed his tariffs on steel imports, some other plants were being built or expanding at the time.

A simple Google search brings up numerous 2015 announcements about planned investments in steel plants. For example, Steel Dynamics announced a $100 million expansion at a mill in Mississippi. Commercial Metals announced a $250 million investment to build a micro-mill in Oklahoma. Nucor and a partner announced a $75 million investment in improvements at a mill in Arkansas. Ferrous CAL announced a $53 million investment in a Michigan plant to make steel for automotive companies.

Energy production

""We ended the last administration`s war on American energy. The United States is now -- and I said it, and I`ll say it all night long, number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And there`s nobody even close."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: The US has not just ""now"" become the world`s top energy producer: it took the top spot : The US has not just ""now"" become the world`s top energy producer: it took the top spot in 2012 , according to the US government`s Energy Information Administration -- under the very Obama administration Trump is accusing of perpetrating a ""war"" on the industry.

The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump`s tenure. ""The United States has been the world`s top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world`s top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia`s,"" the Energy Information Administration says

Wage growth

""...more importantly than anything, wages are up for the first time in many, many years, decades, decades."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Wages have been rising since 2014, using one common measure.

There are various ways to measure wage growth. Median usual weekly earnings, one way that is frequently cited , began increasing in mid-2014 -- though slowly -- after a decline that began in the recession year of 2009. Median usual weekly warnings went from $330 per week in the second quarter of 2014 to $349 per week in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Trump can accurately boast that wage growth during his presidency has been faster than under Obama, but he is wrong to suggest it was declining before he took office.

Obama and manufacturing jobs

""And the previous administration said -- manufacturing -- `you`d need the magic wand.` You know, we`ve all heard the statement. But they basically said it was a dead business, when in fact it`s one of the most important sets of jobs I think you can have anywhere."" -- December 6 remarks at roundtable on small business and red tape

Facts First: Trump`s ""magic wand"" comment was a reference to a remark President Barack Obama made at a PBS : Trump`s ""magic wand"" comment was a reference to a remark President Barack Obama made at a PBS town hall in 2016. Obama scoffed at Trump`s promises to bring back what Obama called ""jobs of the past"" without providing specifics on how he would do so. Contrary to Trump`s claims, though, Obama didn`t say manufacturing was dead or that new manufacturing jobs could not be created; Obama boasted of how many manufacturing jobs were being created during his presidency, saying, ""We actually make more stuff, have a bigger manufacturing base today than we`ve had in most of our history.""

Median household income and energy

""With President Trump, it (median household income) went up $5,000, but whoa, whoa, whoa, in less than three years. That`s a big thing. Wait. And then when you add energy savings and you add tax savings, you have almost a $10,000 gain in three years."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: There is no basis for Trump adding an additional $5,000 to the initial $5,000 in household income growth he is asserting. (That initial $5,000 figure is based on the findings of a firm called Sentier Research). It is entirely unclear what Trump is referring to when he talks about ""energy savings""; household energy costs have increased since Trump took office, as have gasoline costs. (Gasoline costs are lower than they were for most of Obama`s presidency, but higher than they were in 2016.)

China and trade

China`s economic performance

In three separate instances, Trump said that China is having its worst economic year ""in 57 years,"" ""in 56 or 57 years now,"" and ""in at least 57"" years, ""much more than that.""

Facts First: China`s second-quarter GDP growth of 6.2% and third-quarter GDP growth of 6% were its : China`s second-quarter GDP growth of 6.2% and third-quarter GDP growth of 6% were its worst since 1992 , 27 years ago. Trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that 27 years is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason.

Who is paying for Trump`s tariffs on China

""And now we`re taking in billions of dollars in tariffs. And, by the way, they`re eating it. You know, remember, you used to tell me how it will cost us -- they`re eating that money because they don`t want to lose their supply chains."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

Facts First: Study after study , including a report in late November from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has shown that Americans are bearing the vast majority of the cost of the tariffs. And it is Americans who make the actual tariff payments.

The history of tariffs on China

""We`re taking in a lot of money. We haven`t taken any money from China ever, and it`s coming in now by the billions."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Again, Americans are paying for these tariffs. Regardless, it`s not true that the US Treasury has never received any money from tariffs on Chinese products. The US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries; FactCheck.org : Again, Americans are paying for these tariffs. Regardless, it`s not true that the US Treasury has never received any money from tariffs on Chinese products. The US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries; FactCheck.org reported that the US generated an ""average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the US International Trade Commission DataWeb.""

The US also ""takes"" in money from Chinese purchases of US products -- more than $300 billion during Trump`s presidency alone.

China`s wealth

Trump said China is ""down about $32 trillion"" over the last three years. -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

Facts First: Trump was vague about what he meant, but there is no apparent basis for this figure. (In late November, Trump used different figures: ""$24 trillion,"" ""probably $25 trillion,"" and ""probably ... $30 or $35 trillion."") Experts on the Chinese economy rejected previous Trump claims of a $10 trillion drop in Chinese wealth.

George Magnus, a research associate at Oxford University`s China Centre, said, ""I`m afraid I have no idea to what the President is referring and I dare say neither does he.""

The US record at the World Trade Organization

""We never used to win before me, because, before me, the United States was a sucker for all of these different organizations. And now they realize -- the World Trade Organization realizes that my attitude on them: If they don`t treat us fairly, well, I`ll tell you someday what will happen. And we`ve been winning a lot of cases at the World Trade Organization. We virtually -- very rarely did we ever win a case. They took advantage of the United States."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

Facts First: The US has long won cases at the World Trade Organization, and there is no evidence that WTO adjudicators have suddenly changed their behavior. Trump`s own Council of Economic Advisers : The US has long won cases at the World Trade Organization, and there is no evidence that WTO adjudicators have suddenly changed their behavior. Trump`s own Council of Economic Advisers said in a report in February 2018 that the US had won 86% of the cases it has brought since 1995. The global average was 84%.

A Bloomberg Law review in March found that the US success rate in cases it brings to the WTO had increased very slightly since Trump took office, from 84.8% in 2016 to 85.4%.

The trade deficit with the European Union

""But we have a very unfair trade situation, where the US loses a lot of money for many, many years with the European Union -- billions and billions of dollars. I mean, to be specific, over $150 billion a year."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron

Facts First: The trade deficit with the European Union was $114.6 billion in 2018, $101.2 billion in 2017, $92.5 billion in 2016. The deficit was $169.6 billion in 2018 if you only count trade in goods and ignore trade in services. But Trump, as usual, failed to specify that he was using this more limited measure.

We`ll ignore Trump`s characterization of trade deficits as losses, which is sharply disputed by many economists.

Immigration

Democrats and borders

Trump said three times that Democrats support ""open borders.""

Facts First: Even 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.

Mexican soldiers and the border

""...and Mexico is now giving us 27,000 soldiers at our border..."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

""Right now, we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our southern border telling people, `You can`t come in.`"" -- December 7 speech to the Israeli American Council National Summit

Facts First: Mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular.

CNN reported on November 2: ""Nearly 15,000 troops are deployed to Mexico`s northern border, where they`ve set up 20 checkpoints, Mexican Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval said last week at a press briefing on the country`s security strategy. At the southern border, 12,000 troops are deployed and have set up 21 checkpoints.""

Acting US Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan has offered similar numbers, telling reporters in September that 10,000 of approximately 25,000 troops were on Mexico`s southern border.

Foreign and military affairs

Obama and the ISIS caliphate

""We`ve defeated the ISIS caliphate. Nobody thought we could do that so quickly. I did it very quickly. When I came in, it was virtually 100%. And I knocked it down to 0. I knocked it down to 0."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

""Al-Baghdadi created a caliphate bigger than the state of Ohio, think of that, that`s a big caliphate. And we now have taken 100% of the caliphate...and with Obama you did nothing, you did nothing, but get your ass kicked."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Trump is free to criticize Obama`s conduct of the war against ISIS, but it`s not true that ""nothing"" was accomplished under Obama in the fight to eradicate the terror group`s self-proclaimed ""caliphate,"" nor that ISIS possessed ""virtually 100%"" of this territory when Trump took office.

Nicholas Heras, Middle East Security Fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said that ""at the time of his inauguration in January 2017, the Obama administration had regained close to 50% of ISIS`s would-be Caliphate.""

Estimates of pre-Trump progress against ISIS vary -- some put the Obama-era progress closer to a third of former ISIS territory -- but Heras` estimate roughly squares with news reports from the end of the Obama era. Regardless of the precise figure, there is no doubt that ISIS had lost a substantial portion of its land holdings under Obama.

The cost of moving the embassy to Jerusalem

""So, two years ago, I recognized the true capital of Israel, and we opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And we got it built. They were thinking anywhere, for one billion to two billion dollars. I did it for $350,000."" -- December 11 speech at Hanukkah reception and signing of executive order against anti-Semitism

Four days pror, Trump told a lengthy version of this story, saying he was initially told the Jerusalem embassy project would cost ""$2 billion"" or ""up to $2 billion"" but managed to get it built for ""less than 500,000 bucks."" -- December 7 speech to the Israeli American Council National Summit

Facts First: The State Department : The State Department awarded a $21.2 million contract in 2018 for a company to design and build ""compound security upgrades"" related to Trump`s decision to turn the existing facility into an embassy. While the initial modification that allowed the building to open as an embassy cost just under $400,000, that was not the final total.

The size of the Iran deal

In three separate claims, Trump said President Barack Obama ""gave $150 billion"" to Iran, ""paid $150 billion"" to Iran, and gave Iran a ""$150 Billion gift.""

Facts First: Trump was wrong about the ""$150 billion"": the sum in question was Iranian money frozen in foreign financial institutions because of sanctions, not US government money -- and experts say the total was significantly lower than $150 billion. You can read a fuller fact check : Trump was wrong about the ""$150 billion"": the sum in question was Iranian money frozen in foreign financial institutions because of sanctions, not US government money -- and experts say the total was significantly lower than $150 billion.

The Obama administration did send Iran $1.7 billion to settle a decades-old dispute over a purchase of US military goods Iran made before its government was overthrown in the Islamic Revolution of 1979.

Military spending by NATO members

""It was going down for close to 20 years. If you look at a chart, it was like a rollercoaster down, nothing up. And that was going on for a long time. You wouldn`t have had a NATO if you kept going that way."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

""So NATO, which was really heading in the wrong direction three years ago — it was heading down. If you look at a graph, it was to a point where I don`t think they could have gone on much longer."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron

Facts First: Military spending by NATO members had increased for two years prior to Trump`s presidency. According to the latest NATO : Military spending by NATO members had increased for two years prior to Trump`s presidency. According to the latest NATO figures released in November, spending increased by 1.7% in 2015 and 3.0% in 2016.

US military spending, part 1

""Now we have spent two and a half trillion dollars on rebuilding our military. And we have a military that`s the most advanced, the most powerful, by far, of any in the world. Two and a half trillion dollars. We rebuilt our military."" -- December 7 speech to the Israeli American Council National Summit

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. Defense spending for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was $2.05 trillion, and that includes more than three-and-a-half months of Obama`s tenure, since the 2017 fiscal year began in October 2016.

Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he thinks Trump must have been including military funding for the 2020 fiscal year to get to the ""$2.5 trillion"" figure -- but the 2020 fiscal year just started on October 1, and Harrison noted that the defense appropriation has not yet been approved by Congress.

US military spending, part 2

Trump said on two occasions that the US is spending ""4 to 4.3%"" of Gross Domestic Product on defense.

Facts First: The US is expected to spend 3.42% of GDP on defense in 2019, according to NATO estimates issued in November -- similar to its 2018 spending level.

Ammunition

Trump said that when he took office, the US military ""was in trouble."" He added, ""We didn`t have ammunition."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

Facts First: According to military leaders, there was a shortfall in certain kinds of munitions, particularly precision-guided bombs, late in the Obama presidency and early in the Trump presidency. But the claim that ""we didn`t have ammunition"" is a significant exaggeration. Military leaders did not say that they had completely run out of any kind of bomb, let alone ammunition in general.

ISIS prisoners

""But many are from France, many are from Germany, many are from UK. They`re mostly from Europe."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron

Facts First: French President Emmanuel Macron correctly told Trump that it is not true that ""most"" ISIS prisoners in Syria are from Europe.

James Jeffrey, Trump`s special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, said on August 1 that roughly 8,000 of about 10,000 terrorist fighters being held in northeastern Syria are Iraqi or Syrian nationals; there were ""about 2,000 ISIS foreign fighters"" from all other countries. Trump himself tweeted in February to ask that European countries take back ""over 800"" ISIS fighters captured in Syria.

Macron fact-checked Trump to his face, saying: ""The very large number of fighters you have on the ground are ISIS fighters coming from Syria, from Iraq, and the region. It is true that you have foreign fighters coming from Europe, but this is a tiny minority of the overall problem we have in the region.""

An agreement with South Korea

Trump claimed that South Korea had agreed to an increase of ""almost $500 million"" in its payments to the US for the cost of having US troops based in the country. He said that this increase brought the South Korean payment ""close to"" $1 billion from a previous $500 million. -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

Facts First: Trump was correct about the new total but exaggerated the size of the increase, as he has repeatedly on this subject in the past. As the New York Times : Trump was correct about the new total but exaggerated the size of the increase, as he has repeatedly on this subject in the past. As the New York Times reported in February when debunking an earlier version of Trump`s ""$500 million"" claim: ""Under the one-year deal, this year South Korea will pay 1.04 trillion won, or $925 million, an increase of $70 million from last year`s $855 million.""

Trump is now trying to get South Korea to agree to a much larger increase for 2020. American and South Korean officials said this week that they have so far failed to reach an agreement and that the next round of talks is scheduled for January.

Trump and Brexit

""You know that I was a fan of Brexit. I called it the day before. I was opening up Turnberry the day before Brexit...And they asked me whether or not Brexit would happen. I said `yes,` and everybody smiled and they laughed. And I said, `Yes, it`s going to happen, in my opinion.` It was just my opinion. The next day, they had the election, and I was right."" -- December 3 exchange with reporters at meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

Facts First: Trump was not even at Turnberry the day before the vote; he visited the club and spoke to the press : Trump was not even at Turnberry the day before the vote; he visited the club and spoke to the press the day after the vote. Trump did predict Brexit in March 2016; the day before the vote three months later, however, he made no prediction. He said in an interview that day with Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business, ""I don`t think anybody should listen to me,"" because ""I haven`t really focused on it very much,"" but that his ""inclination"" would be that Britain should vote to leave the European Union.

Iran`s economy

""Their GDP went down 25% this year. Twenty-five. Nobody has ever even heard of that."" -- December 7 speech to the Israeli American Council National Summit

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. While Iran`s economy is shrinking, the Statistical Center of Iran : Trump was exaggerating. While Iran`s economy is shrinking, the Statistical Center of Iran reported that the country`s GDP fell by 4.9% in the year 2018-2019.

Experts say there is no apparent basis for Trump`s ""25%"" figure even though Iran`s official economic data is less reliable than official data in the US.

""It`s still not iron-clad stuff, but if the situation was anywhere near 25% decline then the official stats would at least be in the teens. This is also why folks cross-check these numbers with independent and global institutional data (such as IMF`s). My suspicion is that it`s closer to 13-15% decrease, which still puts it a good 10% points below Trump`s claim,"" Hussein Banai, an assistant professor who studies Iran at Indiana University`s School of International Studies, said in an email in October, when Trump made another version of this claim.

The International Monetary Fund has forecast a 9.5% contraction in Iran`s economy this year -- down from an earlier estimate of a 6% contraction, but still not 20% or 25%. The World Bank has forecast an 8.7% contraction in the 2019-2020 period.

Environment

Wind power

""Those windmills, wah wah wah [windmill sound]. `Darling, I want to watch television tonight and there`s no damn wind. What do I do? I want to watch the election results, darling, there`s no wind, the damn wind just isn`t blowing like it used to because of global warming, I think. I think it`s global warming.`"" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Using wind power as part of a mix of power sources does not cause power outages even when the wind isn`t blowing, as the federal Department of Energy : Using wind power as part of a mix of power sources does not cause power outages even when the wind isn`t blowing, as the federal Department of Energy explains on its website. ""Studies have shown that the grid can accommodate large penetrations of variable renewable power without sacrificing reliability, and without the need for `backup` generation,"" the Department of Energy says.

Air quality

""Look, I want clean air. I want clean water, crystal clean. I want -- and that`s what we have at a record level. Our air and our water are cleaner now than it`s ever been, OK, with all that we`re doing."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: By several measures, US air was : By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it has been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency data.

Additionally, there were more ""unhealthy air days"" for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016 -- 799 days across the 35 American cities surveyed by the EPA, up from 702. Though there were significantly more ""unhealthy air days"" in Obama`s first term than there have been in Trump`s, the lowest amount of unhealthy air days -- 598 -- occurred in 2014 under Obama.

Judicial vacancies

""We will soon have 182 federal judges, including court of appeals, nobody can believe it. All because Barack Obama gave us 142 empty seats."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Trump exaggerated. According to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments, there were 103 vacancies on district and appeals courts on Jan. 1, 2017, just before Trump took office, plus a vacancy on the Supreme Court.

Pre-existing conditions

""We will strongly protect patients with pre-existing conditions."" -- December 10 campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania

Facts First: We usually don`t fact check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward : We usually don`t fact check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare`s protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void. He has not issued a plan to reinstate the law`s protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds.

The government`s land holdings

""Secretary Dave Bernhardt. Where is David? David is the largest landlord in the country by a factor of about 50. By a -- when we think we big landlords, he controls half of the United States, actually. Secretary of the Interior."" -- December 11 speech at Hanukkah reception

Facts First: We know Trump was speaking informally here, but ""half of the United States"" is a significant exaggeration. The Congressional Research Service : We know Trump was speaking informally here, but ""half of the United States"" is a significant exaggeration. The Congressional Research Service reported in 2017 : ""The federal government owns roughly 640 million acres, about 28% of the 2.27 billion acres of land in the United States."" The land is managed by the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture.

Road approval times

""...to build a road can take 22 years to get approvals...And we`ve got that process down to four and a half years. It`s going to be -- I think it`s going to be two years. We`re going to try and get it down to almost one year."" -- December 6 remarks at roundtable on small business and red tape

Facts First: There is no evidence Trump has reduced the approval time for federal road approvals.

This version of Trump`s claim was more accurate than his usual one. Though he has repeatedly claimed, inaccurately, that he has gotten the approval time down to two years or less, he acknowledged here that the approval time is significantly longer than that.

Nonetheless, he was wrong when he claimed that the current approval time represents a Trump-era improvement. According to the Federal Highway Administration`s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) page , the department`s median environmental impact statement completion time was 47 months in 2018, up from 46 months in 2017 and 44 months in 2016. (There is no apparent basis for Trump`s ""22 years"" claim; he might be referring to some particular exceptional case.)

We asked the Department of Transportation if we are missing something, but we did not receive a response. We will update this item if we receive any new information.

Approval among Republicans

Trump claimed five times to have a ""95%"" approval rating among Republicans. On four of those occasions, he said this was ""a record."" He twice claimed that Ronald Reagan is in second place at ""87.""

Facts First: Trump`s approval rating among Republicans is very high, regularly in the 80s and sometimes creeping into the 90s, but it has not been 95% in any recent major poll we could find.

Trump was at 81% approval with Republicans in an Ipsos/Reuters poll conducted December 9-10, 85% in a Fox News poll conducted December 8-11, 91% in a NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll conducted December 9-11, 92% in a Quinnipiac University poll conducted December 4-9.", From an imaginary restraining order to a phantom drop in NATO spending: Trump makes 99 false claims in two weeks ,12-2019
"(CNN) Republicans and Democrats will sit down with President Donald Trump in a bipartisan meeting Tuesday aimed at moving closer to protecting hundreds of thousands of immigrants from deportation, but a long-entrenched partisan divide over immigration policy and a looming budget deadline are threatening progress.

Republican and Democrats involved in negotiations over the must-pass January spending deal say that DACA -- the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program -- has become the key to unlocking any funding agreement and some are frustrated with how negotiations are unfolding. Republicans charge that Democrats have all but halted talks on spending caps until there is a resolution on DACA, which gives undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children a chance to stay, work or study in the US without fear of deportation.

""Seems to me that Democrats are holding that deal hostage for a DACA negotiation and we are meeting at the White House tomorrow on a bipartisan basis with the President to see what that might look like,"" said the Senate`s No. 2, Texas Republican John Cornyn. ""But I think that`s going to make the January 19 date pretty hard to hit.""

""It`s a mess,"" said one person directly involved in the negotiations.

A separate GOP aide said the broader environment for both parties simply ""isn`t in a good place right now.""

Democrats argue the White House hasn`t been fully engaged to the degree it needs to be and say that a long and broad policy wish list released last week just further irritated Democrats working closely on the immigration compromise. One Democratic aide argued the White House`s list was ""out of the realm of reality.""

""No wall,"" said Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris of California. ""Listen, I believe in border security. I think it`s very important that we have a secure border, but spending billions and billions of dollars on this wall because of a political promise and a campaign promise is ridiculous.""

What Tuesday`s meeting means

The meeting at the White House on Tuesday was expected to -- at the very least -- symbolize that Trump was growing more serious about finding a bipartisan resolution. But adding more tension to the anticipated meeting for Democrats is the fact the White House invited GOP lawmakers Democrats view as openly hostile to finding a consensus deal on DACA.

In the background, details are still being worked out on what a plan to help recipients of DACA would look like, and a bipartisan group of Senate lawmakers led by Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois and Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina continues to negotiate.

However, the tensions that existed in December but had been overcome with a holiday deadline are playing out in real time now between the two parties.

""I think this is going to be the flexion point where we get some things done or we don`t,"" Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois, said Monday afternoon on CNN.

On Capitol Hill, bipartisan talks have been ongoing for months and the group of senators led by Durbin and Graham acknowledge they need Trump to lay out clear priorities to move forward.

The thinking is that Trump -- who secured the Republican Party`s nomination by promising mass deportations and a border wall -- can offer political cover for Republicans who may be fearful of backing any immigration bill that is viewed as amnesty among their base. With Trump`s blessing, Republicans believe they can find a way to move ahead on DACA. Without it, the votes are compromised.

The bipartisan meeting at the White House on Tuesday comes after Trump met with Republicans last week at the White House and Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona refused to attend, citing the lack of bipartisanship.

White House chief of staff John Kelly, formerly the secretary of homeland security, will also be in the bipartisan meeting Tuesday and has been leading outreach to lawmakers on Capitol Hill on the ongoing talks.

Also on the list Tuesday are a host of lawmakers who would be expected, including Durbin and Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, a 2013 immigration reform veteran. But the list also includes red state Democrats like Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Jon Tester of Montana, as well as Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, who frequently votes with Republicans on immigration and border issues -- a sign that the White House is looking to pick off as many Democrats as it can even if it can`t work with the party`s key negotiators.

Flake told CNN he`s prepared to tell Trump on Tuesday that this DACA deal cannot include a whole host of immigration policy changes but instead has to be narrowly focused if Republicans want to succeed.

""This is not a comprehensive reform bill,"" Flake said. ""We can`t do one before March.""

More than one group pushing immigration plans

In addition to the bipartisan working group, conservatives including Cornyn and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa are having their own conversations, and Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and James Lankford of Oklahoma are also going to be at the White House on Tuesday.

In the House, multiple efforts are underway as well, many led by rank-and-file members. Republican Rep. Will Hurd of Texas and Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar of California have released their own bipartisan framework for a deal after weeks of negotiations. Aguilar is the whip for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. That deal focuses on DACA and border security, but the lawmakers hope additional measures could be added if necessary to finalize a deal.

The bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus -- including Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida, a longtime DACA advocate -- had also been working to reach a compromise that before the break was similar in concept to what the Senate group was working on.

And, as in the Senate, a group of more conservative Republican lawmakers are working on their own proposal, including House Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul of Texas and House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, which would be strongly to the right of most of the bipartisan compromises. Both men will also be at the White House on Tuesday.", DACA negotiations hit a snag ahead of White House meeting ,1-2018
"But the House measure, put forth by a group that includes two committee chairmen — Judiciary’s Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia and Homeland Security’s Michael McCaul of Texas — was far more expansive.

It would require employers to use an Internet-based system, known as E-Verify, to confirm that they are hiring only legal workers; crack down on so-called sanctuary cities by denying them federal grants; allow for the detention of minors who are arrested at the border with their parents; and toughen sentences for criminals who have been deported and return illegally.

The measure would end the diversity visa lottery program, as Mr. Trump wants, and end family-based migration for all relatives other than spouses and minor children. It would offer three-year renewable work permits to DACA recipients, without offering them a path to citizenship.

The new House Republicans’ stand underscored the uncertainty about immigration. Mr. Trump’s positions vacillate daily. And members of both parties are divided. Some Democrats are pressing for confrontation, while others seem to fear a political backlash. Some Republicans are searching for compromise against a conservative tide of anti-immigrant fervor.

Lorella Praeli, the director of immigration policy and campaigns at the American Civil Liberties Union, described the House legislation as a “collection of hard-line provisions designed to sabotage, rather than advance, the possibility of a bipartisan breakthrough.”

It was not clear if the proposal would ever come up for a vote in the House, especially after Tuesday’s White House meeting established the parameters for a bipartisan deal. And it is all but certain to have no future in the Senate, where immigration legislation would need 60 votes for passage and therefore could not make it through the chamber with only Republican support.

The immigration debate on Capitol Hill grew more complicated after a federal judge ruled Tuesday that, for now, the Trump administration could not end the DACA program.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The judge, Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco, wrote that the administration must “maintain the DACA program on a nationwide basis” while lawsuits challenging the decision to end the program move ahead.

Mr. Trump lashed out on Twitter, saying that the United States court system was “broken and unfair,” and members of both parties and immigration activists struggled to understand the legal and political implications of the judge’s ruling.

Officials at the Department of Homeland Security, which administers the program for young immigrants, said they are preparing to follow the order even as they await possible action by the Justice Department to appeal the ruling in the days ahead.

Administration officials expressed confidence that the ruling would be overturned on appeal. And activists urged young immigrants not to take any actions to try to renew their DACA benefits until the legal picture is clearer.

Still, both parties insisted that the legal case is a distraction to the only real, permanent solution for the young immigrants brought to the United States as children: legislation passed by Congress and signed by the president.

Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said he was concerned that as a result of the ruling, “some will say, ‘Now we’ve got a lot of time.’”

Democrats tried to keep up the pressure for quick action.

“Let me be very clear: The ruling last night in no way diminishes the urgency of resolving the DACA issue,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. He added that delay was “a tactic employed by those who do not wish to see a deal.”

Democrats are pushing for a deal on DACA by Jan. 19, when government funding is set to expire. The stakes are significant: If talks break down and lawmakers cannot, at a minimum, approve another stopgap spending bill, much of the government would shut down in less than two weeks.

Complicating matters, both parties face their own internal differences over how to proceed on immigration. Just as Republicans have to contend with more hard-line members, some liberal Democrats are adamant that they will not vote for a government funding measure without a resolution on immigration. Liberal activists have pushed Democrats to withhold their votes for government funding if a DACA deal remains elusive, in order to maximize their leverage.

But for Senate Democrats up for re-election this year in states that Mr. Trump won, a government shutdown could be politically perilous, especially if it is over immigration.

“You know what? Let’s think positive,” said Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, when asked about voting for a spending bill if DACA has not been resolved.

Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, said, “I’m not big on drawing lines in the sand.”

Ms. McCaskill suggested the court ruling could actually help induce a deal more quickly. “I think everybody, especially the Republicans, would prefer us to decide this than the courts,” she said.

As they try to find a bipartisan solution on immigration, lawmakers have also had to try to decipher what exactly would be acceptable to Mr. Trump, given that he holds the veto pen.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, he vowed in a speech that August to “immediately terminate” DACA, adding that anyone who entered the United States illegally would be “subject to deportation.”

After he won the election that fall, he walked back that hard-line position and said, “We’re going to work something out.” Dreamers, he reiterated in April 2017, would be allowed to stay and “should rest easy.” On Sept. 5, Mr. Trump ended the program.

At times, the reversals occurred in the span of a day.

On Tuesday, in a meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers, Mr. Trump signaled a willingness to sign any deal worked out between Democrats and Republicans.

“I mean, I will be signing it. I’m not going to say, ‘Oh, gee, I want this or I want that,’” he said.

But by Tuesday night, Mr. Trump had declared on Twitter exactly what he wanted: “Our country needs the security of the Wall on the Southern Border, which must be part of any DACA approval.”

And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump gave seemingly contradictory stances in a matter of seconds. He affirmed that he would be open to signing “just about any immigration deal,” as a reporter put it, that lawmakers sent him. But asked if he would be willing to sign a deal that does not include funding for a border wall, he responded, “No, no, no, it’s got to include the wall.”", House Republicans’ Hard-Line Immigration Stand Clashes With Trump Overture ,1-2018
"The White House announced it will release a bipartisan framework for an immigration plan this Monday.

Senate Democrats are now faced with the prospect that they will have to allow for funding of a partial border wall in order to give President Donald Trump a bill he would sign into law.

WASHINGTON — Congress is moving forward with a bipartisan plan to address both border security and undocumented immigrants benefiting from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

While a foreseeable pathway to getting some kind of bill on the president`s desk faces significant hurdles, Democrats are facing an inevitability regarding the immigration issue: funding for President Donald Trump`s long-desired wall along the US-Mexico border will have to be included.

The White House announced on Wednesday its intent to release a ""legislative framework Monday that represents a compromise that members of both parties can support,"" adding that it ""will fulfill the four agreed-upon pillars: securing the border and closing legal loopholes; ending extended-family chain migration; canceling the visa lottery, and providing a permanent solution on DACA.""

Democrats are beginning to embrace the possibility of having to fund the wall in a compromise

The inclusion of a wall and fencing along significant portions of the southern US border will be something most Democrats will have to stomach if they want a bill that Trump will sign — they just do not want to call it a wall.

""First of all, using the construction of the border is a term that I think is not the correct term. Will there have to be robust border security? Yes. Will it involve some segments of barrier? Yes,"" said Sen. Claire McCaskill, who serves as the top Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security Committee. ""But to say a border wall, it conjures up the image of sea to shining sea wall and I don’t think anybody in Washington thinks that’s gonna happen, including the president’s chief of staff.""

Alabama Sen. Doug Jones told Business Insider that he assumes funding for wall construction will be in the compromise, but that it is too early to get into the specifics.

""I will tell you this, I think there’s gonna be more money for border security,"" Jones said. ""How that’s gonna be done, I don’t know.""

""It’s always been inevitable that we’re gonna fund border security,"" said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp when asked about wall and fencing construction on the border.

Sen. Jon Tester of Montana told Business Insider that he would be open to wall funding in an immigration bill as long as Congress retains its oversight of how the taxpayer money would be spent.

""It depends on what he’s talking about. If he’s talking about a lump sum figure that says here just go spend it, I am not gonna be in favor of that,"" Tester said. ""If it’s about making sure that Congress has oversight on how that money is spent and making sure that there’s accountability, I’ll certainly take a look at that.""

Disagreeing with her colleagues is Sen. Kamala Harris, who said specific funding for a partial border wall does not have to be in a final deal.

Any compromise will include additional border security enhancements

Republican Sen. Tom Cotton told Business Insider that ""of course"" wall funding will be in a bipartisan compromise, adding that he hopes Democrats ""come to their senses"" on the issue.

""But it’s much more than just money for the southern border,"" Cotton said. ""It also needs to be new legal authorities so the border patrol can actually handle illegal immigrants when they’re apprehended. Northern border states have some concerns as well.""

Cotton also seemingly acknowledged that a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients would be part of the compromise, a position many immigration hawks have been hesitant to support.

""And then of course if DACA recipients are gonna be legalized — and especially receive citizenship — we’re gonna have to address the chain migration issue and limit family sponsorships to spouses and unmarried minor children,"" he said.

""[Democrats] are obsessed with that topic but it is clearly part of a system of border security infrastructure that everybody agrees is necessary,"" said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn.

Allowing Trump to get of one of his signature campaign promises might be a tough pill to swallow. But the wall has become a central pillar in the immigration debate, on which the bipartisan Senate coalition is moving at a rapid pace ahead of the president`s March 5 deadline to resolve the DACA issue.", Democrats are starting to acknowledge the inevitable on Trump`s wall ,1-2018
"(CNN) The Senate finally took action on Tuesday. Not to break the immigration impasse, move forward on guns or hammer out a plan to rebuild the nation`s decaying infrastructure.

Instead, a bipartisan group of 67 -- 17 of them members of the Democratic caucus -- voted to advance a bill that would roll back and revise regulations imposed on banks by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law.

Democratic supporters of the legislation, almost all of them either up for re-election this fall and/or from red or purple states, insist that its sole purpose is to loose small lenders and community banks from the chains of excessive federal oversight and give a shot of adrenaline to bootstrapping entrepreneurs and business owners.

""Main Street businesses and lenders tell me that they need some regulatory relief if we want jobs in rural America,"" Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat who voted for Dodd-Frank (along with seven other Democratic supporters of the new bill), said during a hearing in November of last year. ""These folks are not wearing slick suits in downtown New York or Boston. They are farmers, they are small business owners, they are first-time homebuyers.""

That, in a nutshell, is the messaging. The reality is rather less idyllic.

The vast majority of the benefits tucked into the bill, which either unravels or dilutes important pieces of the existing law, rewards, if not the very biggest, then extremely large institutions. Among them, a group typically referred to as ""midsize banks,"" are familiar faces like BB&T, SunTrust and the American outposts of foreign giants like Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas and Banco Santander. The latter trio hold relatively smaller assets in the US, so they too would benefit.

Before getting into the messy politics here, let`s review the policy.

The bill has three main planks: 1) Banks with less than $10 billion in assets would be exempted from the Volcker rule, which put the brakes on certain kinds of risky trading in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis; 2) The list of banks deemed ""too big to fail,"" and thus faced with tighter restrictions, would be thinned by raising the threshold from $50 billion in assets to $250 billion; and 3) One size fits all regulations, even for the mega-banks -- the ones, as Tester put it, with employees ""wearing slick suits in downtown New York or Boston"" -- would be vulnerable to new pressures, with the Federal Reserve now required to work alongside those institutions to customize certain rules.

The last piece could set off a race to the bottom, with the largest players on Wall Street demanding more freedom and, if they`re denied, being able to point to the competition as evidence to help make their case. But the bulk of the benefits in the bill go to the so-called medium-sized banks. Here, per CNNMoney`s Donna Borak , is what would change for banks with assets up to $250 billion:

""They would no longer have to hold as much capital to cover losses on their balance sheets. They would not be required to have plans in place to be safely dismantled if they failed. And they would have to take the Fed`s bank health test only periodically, not once a year.""

How dangerous would that be? The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office weighed in with its take on Monday, before the initial vote, and came to the conclusion that the bill, if passed, would increase the chances of another 2008-style collapse.

""CBO`s estimate of the bill`s budgetary effect is subject to considerable uncertainty, in part because it depends on the probability in any year that a systemically important financial institution (SIFI) will fail or that there will be a financial crisis,"" the report says , before adding this considerable caveat (emphasis mine): ""CBO estimates that the probability is small under current law and would be slightly greater under the legislation.""

Oh, and it would also increase the federal deficit by $671 million.

So, why -- as a matter of policy and politics -- would so many Democrats side with Republicans in supporting this bill?

For that, we turn to some of its most insistent backers, moderates from Trump states facing re-election this fall. Tester is one, along with Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana. Sens. Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joe Manchin of West Virginia are also on board. All of them face tough re-election fights. CNN rates all but Tester`s contest in Montana as a ""tossup.""

""This legislation would make it easier for Hoosier families to gain access to mortgages and small businesses to access capital,"" Donnelly said in a statement, ""and it also includes important new consumer protections, such as free credit freezes, in response to the Equifax data breach.""

Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who is strongly favored in his coming re-election bid, has also talked about ""consolidation of the banking industry in Virginia"" as an unintended consequence of Dodd-Frank`s current language. If smaller banks are freer to pursue the business they desire, the theory goes, the more likely they are to thrive on their own.

If the policy end of this is, most charitably, complicated, then the political end seems downright impenetrable.

The conventional wisdom going into 2017 was that red state senators might have to stray from the party line every now and again to show off their independence and solidify their standing with the Republican and independent voters who will mostly decide their fates this November. But like so many political assumptions in the Trump era, it was largely disproved. Democrats, most notably in the many fights to preserve Obamacare, stuck together.

With an energized base on their side, and poking at it when they threaten to go wobbly, Democrats are looking at better-than-expected polling and hearing a chorus of canaries singing in GOP coal mines. But with the bank bill, they are showing the limits of that unity -- and offering up some jarring, if fundamentally unsurprising, insight into where their priorities lie.

The loudest criticism of the bank bill in Washington has come from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who is eyeing a White House run in 2020, and has seen the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau she crafted as part of Dodd-Frank undermined by the administration. Democrats might have used their leverage here to backstop the CFPB, but never made it a sticking point.

A frustrated Warren on Tuesday tweeted out the names of the Democrats who voted to advance the bill, and added this: ""Senate Republicans voted unanimously for the #BankLobbyistAct. But this bill wouldn`t be on the path to becoming law without the support of these Democrats. The Senate just voted to increase the chances your money will be used to bail out big banks again.""

The CBO report said as much, so this was hardly a cheap shot. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who`s another vocal critic and 2020 contender, asked in a statement, ""Are our memories so short that we have learned nothing from (the 2007-2008 financial) disaster?"" This bill, he added, would ""lay the groundwork for another massive financial collapse.""

Neither Sanders nor Warren impugned their colleagues` motives or political savvy. Maybe they should have. Because the politics here don`t make much sense. It`s true that Trump was elected, in part, on a platform of economic populism. For all that`s happened since, that hasn`t changed. The idea, then, that red state voters would turn on a Democrat who voted against a gift to the financial sector simply doesn`t compute.

Where in the past this kind of deal might have passed relatively unnoticed, the current state of heightened awareness, especially among liberals, will make that impossible. Hence the leadership`s opposition, even if they don`t seem to be whipping others to follow. However it plays out, a swift backlash isn`t guaranteed, but increased suspicion and cynicism going forward are a good bet.

And for Democrats, in 2018 but especially when it comes time to challenge Trump, that might be the most dangerous thing of all.", Why are (some) Democrats signing on to the Republican bank bill? ,3-2018

"WASHINGTON — The White House doctor nominated to run the Veterans Affairs department will continue to seek confirmation despite concerns about his performance and behavior in his current job that were publicly aired Tuesday.

In a private meeting on Tuesday, President Donald Trump asked Dr. Ronny Jackson about the allegations, a White House official said, and Jackson told him they weren’t true. When Trump asked how he wanted to handle the matter, Jackson he wanted to fight the accusations and not drop out, the official said, and Trump agreed to the approach.

Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, the top Democrat on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, laid out the allegations in a CNN interview Tuesday night, saying the committee was investigating allegations from active duty and retired military officers who had worked in the White House medical office and who had come to the committee with numerous complaints, including that Jackson belittled lower-ranking employees, drank to excess on overseas trips, and handed out prescriptions “like candy,” walking down the aisle during flights doling out drugs to help people fall asleep and wake up.

He said that Jackson allegedly was drunk while accompanying President Barack Obama on overseas trips, so that he “couldn’t respond because he had been drinking so much,” leaving someone else to fill in. Tester also said that Jackson’s treatment of workers created an unbearable work environment.

Jon Tester appears to be setting a new Beltway record for unsportsmanlike conduct.

"Talk about an anticlimax: On Thursday the Senate confirmed Mike Pompeo 57-42 after Democrats threatened for weeks to torpedo the Secretary of State for no reason other than rank partisanship. This is a preview of what Democrats will do if they win the Senate in November—shut down the Trump Administration—and the GOP needs to kick it into gear on staffing the executive branch.

Six Democrats and one independent voted to confirm Mr. Pompeo, mostly those running for re-election this year in Trump states, including Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. This exposes the political cynicism of the outrage against Mr. Pompeo.

The other story absorbing the oxygen in Washington is Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson, the White House physician who on Thursday withdrew his name to run Veterans Affairs. President Trump treated Dr. Jackson like cannon fodder by nominating him without preparation and then musing that he should drop out amid anonymous allegations of misconduct.

Potomac Watch Podcast

But Dr. Jackson didn’t deserve days of leaks and smears from Montana’s Democratic Senator Jon Tester. Dr. Jackson said in his withdrawal statement that charges of drinking and writing too many prescriptions, among others, are “completely false and fabricated.” If the charges are true, then why didn’t they come up during his 12-year tenure working for three Presidents? Whatever the merits, Mr. Tester should have treated serious allegations with discretion, but he’s out to feed The Resistance as he runs for re-election.

This will be business as usual if Democrats take the Senate. Democrats won’t confirm a single appellate or Supreme Court nominee. They might confirm politically correct nominees for executive-branch jobs, but Mr. Trump will have half a government. Chuck Schumer’s Democrats have already invoked “cloture” on some 89 nominees, which triggers 30 hours of debate, even on noncontroversial candidates. That compares with 12 for Barack Obama’s first two years and four for George W. Bush. The Senate this week confirmed an Ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, who has been in a Senate rubber room for months.

The question is what Republicans can do in the eight months left that they have Senate control. James Lankford of Oklahoma this week began to move a bill to change Senate rules and limit debate on most nominees to eight hours. This needs 60 votes to pass, and Democrats are resisting.

But perhaps the move is beginning to cause some Democratic movement. The Senate confirmed 25 nominees on Thursday, 23 by voice vote, after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell threatened to make Senators work into the weekend. He also filed cloture on six more appellate-court nominees, which would bring the total to 21 this Congress when confirmed, a modern record for a President’s first Congress.

Mr. Trump said this week that Mr. McConnell should force Senators to work every weekend, but the Majority Leader thinks this could backfire because Democrats would then use Senate rules to stop everything. Mr. McConnell is the master tactician, but Republicans in the provinces want to see that Senators are fighting to overcome Democratic obstruction.

On Thursday, Trump’s physician Ronny Jackson withdrew from consideration to head the department after allegations that he had been lax with prescription drugs and drank alcohol on the job.

The allegations, which Jackson categorically denied as false, had prompted the Senate to put a hold on his hearing for the job of leading the federal government’s second largest department.

Trump had already singled out Senator Jon Tester, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs committee, who is up for re-election in November in Montana.

“Allegations made by Senator Jon Tester against Admiral/Doctor Ron Jackson are proving false... Tester should resign,” Trump tweeted on Saturday.

“Admiral Jackson is the kind of man that those in Montana would most respect and admire, and now, for no reason whatsoever, his reputation has been shattered. Not fair, Tester!,” Trump added.

Tester did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Jackson is a U.S. Navy rear admiral who has been physician to three presidents. Democrats said more than 20 people, whose names they withheld, said Jackson had prescribed himself medications, got drunk at a Secret Service party, wrecked a government vehicle and once could not be reached on a work trip to provide medical treatment because he was passed out drunk in a hotel room.

Tester had said Jackson’s nickname was “the candyman” because of his willingness to hand out prescription drugs.

None of the records noted alcohol use. Reuters also reviewed two years of audits of the White House medical unit pharmacy, which did not show any major issues.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s physician Ronny Jackson on Thursday withdrew from consideration to head the Veterans Affairs department after allegations that he had been lax with prescription drugs and drank alcohol on the job.

The allegations, which Jackson categorically denied as false, had prompted the Senate to put a hold on his hearing for the job of leading the federal government’s second largest department.

The upset was the latest chaotic personnel decision to rock Trump’s White House, which has been roiled by an unusually high number of firings and resignations.

During his campaign, Trump had pledged to clean up the VA, which oversees healthcare and benefits for about 20 million military veterans, a constituency with considerable political clout.

The agency has long been criticized for the quality of its care and the red tape that veterans encounter. Trump fired his first secretary, David Shulkin, in March after concerns about unauthorized travel expenses.

Jackson, 50, was a surprising pick for the job, and even Trump acknowledged he lacked experience running large organizations.

House Speaker Paul Ryan said the allegations warranted further review.

“Whether or not there’s merit to these allegations, we should find if there’s merit to these allegations, and if there are, then the proper oversight should be done,” Ryan, a Republican, told reporters.

On Thursday, Trump lashed out about the uproar in a phone interview with Fox News, blaming Democrats who had compiled a list of complaints about Jackson from military medical officials who had worked with him.

“He would have done a great job,” Trump said of Jackson. “These are all false accusations. They’re trying to destroy a man.”

Trump singled out Senator Jon Tester, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs committee, who is up for re-election in November in Montana, saying Tester “has to have a big price to pay in Montana.”

NEW CANDIDATE IN MIND

Trump, who was set to host a group of veterans at the White House on Thursday, said he has a new candidate with “political capabilities” for the job but did not announce his pick.

Jackson is a U.S. Navy rear admiral who has been physician to three presidents. Democrats said more than 20 people, whose names they withheld, said Jackson had prescribed himself medications, got drunk at a Secret Service party, wrecked a government vehicle and once could not be reached on a work trip to provide medical treatment because he was passed out drunk in a hotel room.

Tester had said Jackson’s nickname was “the candyman” because of his willingness to hand out prescription drugs. He urged Congress to continue its investigation into the White House medical office.

Presidential press secretary Sarah Sanders said Jackson was on the job at the White House on Thursday but White House officials declined to immediately make clear whether he would remain as the top White House physician.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer blamed the White House for being “sloppy and careless” in vetting its candidate, and said senators were obligated to pursue the complaints from military officials.

One veterans’ group, Concerned Veterans for America, said in a statement that the White House should take its time to vet a new nominee for the VA job.

Jackson has worked as a presidential physician since the George W. Bush administration and has been the lead doctor for Trump as well as former President Barack Obama. He is well-liked by both Republican and Democratic administration officials.

“The allegations against me are completely false and fabricated,” Jackson said in a statement on Thursday.

“Unfortunately, because of how Washington works, these false allegations have become a distraction for this president and the important issue we must be addressing - how we give the best care to our nation’s heroes,” Jackson said.

The Iraq war veteran took on a higher profile when he gave a long and glowing account of Trump’s health at news conference in January after his first presidential medical exam, saying Trump had “incredibly good genes.”

Jackson’s qualifications to lead the sprawling Veterans Affairs department were questioned from the time Trump nominated him in late March. The agency has 350,000 employees and runs 1,700 facilities that serve more than 9 million veterans a year.

“It’s my duty to make sure Montana veterans get what they need and have earned, and I’ll never stop fighting for them as their Senator,” Tester said.

Jackson, a U.S. Navy rear admiral who has been physician to three presidents, has categorically denied the accusations as false. Later at a campaign rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump suggested he had damaging information on Tester.

“Tester started throwing out things that he’s heard, well I know things about Tester that I could say too,” said Trump. “And if I said them, he’d never be elected again.”

Trump earlier tweeted that he had been told by the Secret Service that the Democrat’s statements on Jackson were untrue.

“There were no such findings. A horrible thing that we in D.C. must live with, just like phony Russian Collusion. Tester should lose race in Montana. Very dishonest and sick!” he tweeted.

There’s nothing subtle about the campaign ad on immigration that Republican Matt Rosendale is running in his quest to win the right to challenge Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in Montana this fall.

“Liberals from California to Washington are fighting President Trump on illegal immigration,” a grim Mr. Rosendale tells a group of Montanans seated around him. “They push for amnesty. They protect sanctuary cities....I’ll stand with President Trump. We’ll get tough, and we’ll build that wall.”

Donald Trump Jr. and Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle are officially dating.

They posted matching Instagram posts from a fly-fishing trip in Montana over the weekend.

Trump split from his wife of 13 years, Vanessa, earlier this year, and is still in the middle of his divorce.

It’s official: Donald Trump Jr. and Fox News legal analyst Kimberly Guilfoyle are an item.

Trump, 40, and Guilfoyle, 49, have been rumored to in a relationship since May, but a series of Instagram posts of the two on a romantic fly-fishing trip in Montana this weekend have sealed the deal.

He is currently in the process of divorcing his ex-wife Vanessa Trump, his wife of 13 years he had five children with.

Guilfoyle has been married twice before – first to California’s lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom, whom she divorced in 2005, and then to interior designer Eric Villency from 2006 to 2009.

She was a prosecutor in California for much of her life before moving to New York City to pursue a career in broadcast television. She started out at CNN, but has been an analyst on Fox News since 2006.

The new couple went to Montana for Trump to speak at the state’s Republican convention in support of Senate candidate Matt Rosendale, where he confirmed the two were dating.

“Just as everyone else thanks their significant others, I got to thank Kimberly for coming out here. We’re going to take her fishing tomorrow, then shooting,” he told the crowd, according to Vanity Fair. “This is a miniature test to see if she really likes it, or if she’s going to pretend to like it, but either way we’re going to have a good time – or at least I will.”

Trump has had a life-long passion for the outdoors, which Guilfoyle seems to share.

In matching Instagram photos shared on Sunday, she looked at ease standing in a river in full-on fishing gear – and sporting a Trump hat.

On Saturday, Trump shared another photo with Guilfoyle at a Bret Michaels concert in Long Island, which Guilfoyle re-posted to her profile.

After Trump and Vanessa announced their split this spring, Vanessa seemed to give her blessing to her estranged husband’s new relationship on Twitter June 14.

“The lengths people will go to attack a woman simply because she’s dating Don. We’ve been separated for over 9 months and respect each other’s decisions & privacy,” Vanessa wrote. “We’ll focus on raising our great kids.Would be nice if the press did the same rather than obsess over our pvt lives!”

WASHINGTON—Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement Wednesday, setting the stage for a monumental battle over the nation’s constitutional direction, handing President Donald Trump the chance to cement the Supreme Court’s conservative course for years to come and stoking raw passions in both political parties going into this fall’s battle for Congress.

“He will be missed,” Mr. Trump said of Justice Kennedy. “We have a very excellent list of great, talented, highly educated, highly intelligent— hopefully, tremendous—people,” he added of a possible successor.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) immediately promised to confirm Mr. Trump’s nominee, whoever it may be, before the Democrats can potentially recapture the chamber in November.

“We will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy’s successor this fall,” Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor, adding, “We’ll look forward to yet another outstanding selection.”

Democrats, still furious over Mr. McConnell’s refusal to consider President Barack Obama’s nominee for a 2016 vacancy, Judge Merrick Garland, tried to stop an all-but-inevitable result. If Republicans wanted to give voters a say in the Supreme Court selection in 2016, the Democrats said, GOP leaders should do the same now.

“Millions of people are just months away from determining the senators who should vote to confirm or reject the president’s nominee, and their voices deserve to be heard now,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), “as Leader McConnell thought they deserved to be heard then.”

The partisan intensity flowed in large part from the pivotal role Justice Kennedy has played over his 30 years on the high court. While most appointees in recent years have succeeded a like-minded predecessor, Justice Kennedy, while conservative in nature, nonetheless has proved a maverick on issues that have helped define modern American society.

His departure puts in play an array of consequential issues, with liberal rulings on access to abortion, gay rights, capital punishment and voting rights having been decided by his decision to part from fellow court conservatives.

Supreme Court nominations in recent decades have become fodder for bitter public lobbying campaigns, as opponents seek embarrassing details on a nominee and supporters air ads on his or her behalf.

This year, the vacancy lands in the middle of a political climate that is already overheated. The approach of the first midterm vote since Mr. Trump’s victory has produced harsh rhetoric, an array of demonstrations and protests, and political turmoil in both parties.

Polls suggest Democrats currently have an edge when it comes to voter enthusiasm given their widespread distaste for the president, but Republican operatives hope a Supreme Court vacancy will drive more GOP voters to the polls, including some who may have misgivings about Mr. Trump but embrace his call for conservative judges.

Conservatives in recent years have redoubled their effort to groom and vet judicial candidates with ideological pedigrees, pushing relentlessly when they have held the White House to get them through. For many in the GOP establishment, it was Mr. Trump’s pledge to delegate judicial selections to them that overcame initial discomfort with the political outsider who in other fields relied on his gut rather than party orthodoxy.

Mr. Trump’s first nominee, Justice Neil Gorsuch, was selected from lists assembled by leaders of the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, two intellectual bulwarks of Washington’s Republican leadership. Mr. Trump has promised that subsequent choices will follow from their rosters as well.

Leonard Leo, the Federalist Society executive who steered Justice Gorsuch’s selection for the White House, immediately took a leave of absence Wednesday that allows him to reprise that role at Mr. Trump’s side.

People who have spoken with Mr. Leo and others in the decision-making process said the calculus for the White House now would include a strong preference for one of the six women on the existing lists as a means of shoring up support from two female senators who have prominently bucked their party since Mr. Trump was sworn in, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

Mr. Trump’s list of 25 potential candidates includes judges Amy Coney Barrett of Indiana, Allison Eid of Colorado, Britt Grant of Georgia, Joan Larsen of Michigan, Margaret Ryan of Virginia and Diane Sykes of Wisconsin.

Ken Blackwell, who was the domestic policy adviser for Mr. Trump’s transition team, described what he saw as a “breakthrough opportunity” for the president on Wednesday in the chance to ensure a historic first of seating an “ironclad originalist” woman on the Supreme Court.

But that is far from the only consideration. Some inside the White House think Brett Kavanaugh, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, should be a leading candidate, a White House official said.

The vacancy also presents a rare rallying focus for an at-times-tumultuous administration that looks back at the Gorsuch nomination as one of its most seamless accomplishments to date.

Republicans on Capitol Hill likewise were eager to relive a rare episode in the Trump era of a united GOP. Justice Kennedy’s departure comes amid battles over such issues as trade and immigration that are badly dividing the party in advance of the midterms, and some Republican candidates have suggested they would rather talk about judges than Mr. Trump’s more provocative statements and tweets.

“President Trump will have another opportunity to appoint a conservative justice who will carry out the constitutional readings, and I think that’s very important,” Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 3 House Republican, told reporters Wednesday.

Across the aisle, Democrats promised vigorous resistance, after being stung in recent days by a series of 5-4 Supreme Court decisions that went against their positions on issues from immigration to abortion to unions.

“On the heels of another Supreme Court term defined by a Republican 5-4 majority delivering big wins for right-wing and corporate interests, Justice Kennedy’s retirement should be a wake-up call,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D., R.I.). “I’ll do everything in my power to keep President Trump, Sen. McConnell and their dark-money backers from installing another nominee predetermined to assist the wealthy and powerful.”

But it’s not clear what Democrats can do to block a Trump nominee if the Republicans—who hold a 51-49 advantage in the Senate with Vice President Mike Pence casting tiebreaking votes—stick together now.

Many progressives, who showed their muscle within the party in Tuesday’s primary victories, support blocking Mr. Trump’s nominee by any means necessary.

“Mitch McConnell won the showdown over the last Supreme Court vacancy,” said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is backing liberal candidates in races this year. “Now it’s [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer’s turn. Americans now and for generations will remember the strength or weakness he projects in this moment.”

But an aggressive strategy, even if it were somehow successful, could backfire for a number of Senate Democrats who are up for re-election this year in states Mr. Trump carried in 2016, such as Sens. Joe Manchin in West Virginia and Joe Donnelly in Indiana.

Republicans believe that confirming conservative judges is a strong base motivator, and several GOP Senate candidates pounced on their opponents just hours after Justice Kennedy’s announced retirement.

Rep. Marsha Blackburn, the Republican in the race for Tennessee’s open Senate seat, immediately said she would vote to confirm judges like Justice Gorsuch. “This is an important difference between Phil Bredesen and me,” she said of her Democratic opponent. “He will be with Chuck Schumer, who will attempt to block the president’s pick and weaken the court.”

Mr. Bredesen tweeted that he would “vote for or against a nominee based solely on whether I believe them to be highly qualified & ethical, not based on partisan politics.”

Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana voted against Mr. Gorsuch, as his Republican challenger, Matt Rosendale, noted Wednesday. “I’m not holding my breath that Tester will finally…support the president’s nominee,” Mr. Rosendale said.

Mr. Tester said that he takes “my constitutional duty to vet all nominees very seriously.”

Messrs. Manchin and Donnelly, along with Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, voted to confirm Justice Gorsuch.

Ms. Heitkamp said she would consider a nominee “who reflects the same qualities embodied by Justice Kennedy of being fair, pragmatic and empathetic to all who appear before the Court.” Mr. Donnelly said he “will thoroughly review the record and qualifications of any nominee.” Mr. Manchin didn’t return a request for comment.

Some Democrats held out a glimmer of hope based on the Republicans’ bare majority in the Senate. Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), who is at home battling an aggressive form of brain cancer, may not be in Washington to vote, leaving Mr. McConnell with 50 GOP senators, meaning any defections could create problems for the Republican leader.

Sen. Michael Bennet (D., Colo.) highlighted that close division. “The president should resist the temptation to nominate an extremist who could be approved only by a bare majority vote,” he said. “We should not poison the court further with the Senate’s partisanship.”

Democrats also immediately appealed to their base for funds to fuel their November campaigns. Barely an hour after Justice Kennedy’s announcement, fundraising emails started hitting Democratic activists.

“This seat, this coming appointment, could be the difference between a woman’s right to make her own health-care choices, and Roe v. Wade being overturned,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.) said in pitch for $3 donations.

Social conservatives agreed. “Justice Kennedy’s retirement from the Supreme Court marks a pivotal moment for the fight to ensure every unborn child is welcomed and protected under the law,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which supports antiabortion candidates for federal office.

WASHINGTON—Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement Wednesday, setting the stage for a monumental battle over the nation’s constitutional direction, handing President Donald Trump the chance to cement the Supreme Court’s conservative course for years to come and stoking raw passions in both political parties going into this fall’s battle for Congress.

“We really have to take our hats off to Justice Kennedy,” Mr. Trump said at an evening rally in North Dakota.

Mr. Trump said he would look to nominate a successor “that’s going to be there for 40 years, 45 years.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) immediately promised to confirm Mr. Trump’s nominee, whoever it may be, before the Democrats can potentially recapture the chamber in November.

“We will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy’s successor this fall,” Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor, adding, “We’ll look forward to yet another outstanding selection.”

"HELENA, Mont.— Jerry Swick, an Army veteran who currently resides in this mountain enclave, plans to vote this fall to keep Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in Congress. He just doesn’t know how he would tell that to President Donald Trump, for whom Mr. Swick voted in 2016.

Mr. Trump will host a campaign rally in Big Sky Country Thursday in an effort to corral his supporters behind Matt Rosendale, the Republican state auditor who hopes to quash Mr. Tester’s hopes for a third term.

“I guess if Trump came up to me and asked me to vote for Rosendale, I’d say, ‘Yeah, sure,’ ” said Mr. Swick, who in the 1970s served in the Army Signal Corps. “But then I’d go out and still vote for Tester.”

Mr. Trump and Senate Democrats from states the president won in 2016 will battle this fall over voters like Mr. Swick, who still enthusiastically support the president but may decide to keep their incumbent Democrats in Washington. Mr. Tester is one of 10 Senate Democrats up for re-election this year in states where Mr. Trump beat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

Republicans currently hold 51 seats in the Senate, compared with 49 controlled by Democrats. The GOP is aiming to pick off a few of the Trump-state Democrats to offset any losses they experience in November so they can protect or expand their caucus. Of the 10 red-state Democrats, four are listed by Cook Political Report as “tossups”; three Republican-held seats are ranked the same way. Mr. Tester’s race is rated as “likely” to remain in the Democratic column.

Many of these vulnerable Democrats plan to keep their Senate seats by positioning themselves as champions of their local constituents rather than trumpeting progressive agenda items such as Medicare-for-all or pledging to “resist” Mr. Trump’s presidency.

For Mr. Tester, that means focusing on public-lands policy and offering entreaties to Montana’s veteran population, one of the largest in the nation. It also means highlighting what Democrats say is perhaps Mr. Tester’s biggest asset: his reputation as a “real Montanan” who years ago lost three fingers in a meat grinder while working on his 1,800-acre dirt farm in Big Sandy, home to fewer than 600 residents.

On Tuesday, Mr. Tester was plowing peas in a field where he will start seeding wheat later this year or in the spring. A third-generation farmer, he typically works 12-hour days in Big Sandy in between voting in Washington and traveling this vast state to meet with constituents.

A “real Montanan,” he said, is someone who “is not phony, somebody who is what they are.”

The Trump Factor in Senate Races To defend 10 Senate seats they hold in states Trump won, Democrats must break a trend of voters increasingly backing the same party for the Senate and White House.

Republicans argue that no matter how much incumbent Democrats appeal to their states, Mr. Trump is a stronger asset in parts of the country like Montana. Mr. Trump scored a 20-point margin over Mrs. Clinton in Montana, and Republicans expect Mr. Trump to cast Democratic incumbents like Mr. Tester as obstructionists.

“He hasn’t really supported the president,” Montana GOP Chairman Debra Lamm said of Mr. Tester. “So I think the tides have turned against him.”

Mr. Tester has voted against legislation pushed by the White House, such as the GOP tax law and efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Tester also voted against Justice Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court and was instrumental in sinking Mr. Trump’s nomination of Dr. Ronny Jackson to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs.

“It shows Republicans who might have voted for Tester in past elections that he doesn’t actually stand with us,” said one GOP operative working to elect Republicans this November. “Just keep in mind the president’s branding in a state like Montana.”

Mr. Tester in the coming months will face another politically risky vote on Mr. Trump’s nominee to succeed retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. But that vote also presents a dicey choice for the White House, as the president is courting Democratic senators from states he won, hoping to draw them over the partisan divide and get his nominee on to the High Court.

When Mr. Trump visits Great Falls on Thursday, he is expected to bring Mr. Rosendale on stage and portray him as vital to advancing the Make America Great Again agenda that swept Mr. Trump into the White House.

“It’ll be interesting to see what he does talk about,” Mr. Tester said of the president’s upcoming visit. Asked if he would be watching the speech, the senator responded: “Hell no,” adding that after participating in a roundtable on trade Thursday, he’d probably be busy on his tractor.

“I doubt Rosendale could change the oil on a tractor,” Mr. Tester said.

The Democrats have dubbed Mr. Rosendale, who is originally from Baltimore, as “Maryland Matt” in attack ads, an effort to juxtapose his background with Mr. Tester’s roots in the state. Mr. Rosendale said the strategy is a deflection from Mr. Tester’s opposition to many cornerstones of the Trump agenda.

“If the people like the agenda that has been put forth by the president, then clearly…they are going to be much more likely to have that become a reality with Matt Rosendale sitting in the U.S. Senate than with Jon Tester,” Mr. Rosendale said in an interview.

On his farm Tuesday, Mr. Tester reflected on his April decision to release a series of startling allegations against Dr. Jackson, the president’s nominee to lead VA who went on to withdraw from consideration. Dr. Jackson denied accusations that he crashed a government car after drinking alcohol, and liberally dispensed prescription drugs, including opioid painkillers and sleep aids.

Mr. Tester, who was criticized by the White House before Dr. Jackson withdrew, has no regrets.

“Bring it,” he said. “I did my constitutional duty on Ronny Jackson.”

The White House said its own review of documents turned up no evidence to support two central allegations that doomed Dr. Jackson’s candidacy, and Mr. Trump called on the senator to resign. “The great people of Montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being,” the president tweeted during the April showdown.

Mr. Tester’s allies say the exposure of allegations against Dr. Jackson resonates in Montana as putting the state’s veterans above Mr. Trump.

“I think the key is to always focus on the issues that are most important to your state,” said Sen. Doug Jones (D., Ala.), who won his seat in an upset in a December special election. Mr. Jones has sent out fundraising emails on behalf of Mr. Tester, whom Mr. Jones called “one of my favorites” in the Senate.

“I think Jon wanted to make sure whoever was the next head of the VA was someone who was qualified and not just there because of a friendship or whatever with the president,” Mr. Jones said.

Mr. Swick, the army veteran in Helena, doesn’t see a vote for Mr. Tester as a vote against Mr. Trump—whom he says he would like to see become a two-term president.

“Tester has a track record,” Mr. Swick said, pointing to advocacy for veterans. “I’ve made up my mind.”

"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reportedly plans on gifting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un an Elton John CD featuring the song ""Rocket Man."" Trump reportedly wrote a message on the CD and signed it.

Trump`s inspiration for the gift reportedly stemmed from a conversation he had with Kim during their June summit in Singapore, in which the song reportedly came up.

In what was considered to be one of the lowest points in US-North Korean relations, Trump referred to Kim as ""little rocket man"" in speeches and tweets.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo travelled to North Korea on Friday, his third trip to the region, as part of an effort to solidify agreements on denuclearisation.

Pompeo trip comes less than a month after US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un participated in a joint summit in Singapore.

But the US`s top diplomat also planned to give Kim a gift: an Elton John CD featuring the song ""Rocket Man.""

Trump`s inspiration for the gift reportedly stemmed from a conversation he had with Kim during the summit, sources told the conservative South Korean news outlet, Chosun Ilbo.

""Trump then asked Kim if he knew the song and Kim said no,"" one diplomatic source reportedly said.

Trump was said to have written a message on the CD and signed it, according to Chosun Ilbo.

At one of the lowest points in US-North Korean relations since Trump took office, the US president frequently called Kim ""little rocket man"" in Trump`s speeches and tweets in 2017.

""We can`t have madmen out there shooting rockets all over the place,"" Trump said at the rally in Huntsville, Alabama. ""This shouldn`t be handled now, but I`m gonna handle it because we have to handle it. `Little Rocket Man.`""

But while it appeared Trump was mocking Kim at the time, he reportedly told people at a Republican fundraiser in September that his nickname for Kim was intended to be a compliment.

On Thursday, Trump also mentioned Elton John during a campaign rally for Republican state auditor Matt Rosendale in Montana. Trump referenced the size of the crowds at his rallies and said he had ""broken more Elton John records"".

Pompeo`s trip comes amid reports that various facilities at a North Korean nuclear complex are operating as usual, and a scathing US intelligence assessment that found the regime intended to ""deceive"" the US.

The assessment revealed that, in recent months, North Korea had upped its production of fuel for nuclear weapons at several secret sites. The officials said they believe Kim may be trying to conceal the secret facilities.

""Work is ongoing to deceive us on the number of facilities, the number of weapons, the number of missiles,"" one senior US intelligence official said to NBC News. ""We are watching closely.""

Despite the lingering questions, Trump expressed optimism about the efforts to curb North Korea`s nuclear ambitions.

"President Donald Trump urged his supporters in Montana to back the Republican challenging Democratic Sen. Jon Tester this fall, telling voters in a state he carried by 20 points that Mr. Tester “doesn’t share your values.”

In televised remarks Thursday, Mr. Trump cast the Republican candidate, state auditor Matt Rosendale, as the ally he needs in Washington to carry out his agenda, such as hardening security at the southern U.S. border.

“It’s time to retire liberal Democrat Jon Tester,” Mr. Trump said. “You can right your wrong in November.”

The rally in Great Falls, Mont., marked Mr. Trump’s latest effort to persuade supporters in states he won handily in 2016 to vote against vulnerable Democratic incumbents, in an effort to potentially expand the GOP’s majority in the Senate.

Mr. Tester, who is seeking his third term, has emphasized that he is a centrist willing to work with Mr. Trump. In a pre-emptive defense, the Tester campaign placed full-page advertisements in more than a dozen Montana newspapers on Thursday that said Mr. Trump signed 16 of Mr. Tester’s bills into law.

“Jon’s record is clear—if it’s good for Montana, Jon works with anyone from either party to get things done,” said Chris Meagher, a spokesman for the Tester campaign. “If it’s bad for Montana, he’ll stand up to anyone.”

At his rally, Mr. Trump attacked Mr. Tester for his role in sinking the president’s nomination of Dr. Ronny Jackson to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Mr. Tester also voted against the GOP’s tax overhaul, efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and Justice Neil Gorsuch’s nomination last year to the Supreme Court.

“He never votes for me,” Mr. Trump said.

Mr. Tester said in an interview earlier this week that he would run on his record, including his decision to release allegations that Dr. Jackson crashed a government car after drinking alcohol and liberally dispensed prescription drugs and sleep aids. Dr. Jackson denied the allegations.

Thursday’s rally offered an early glimpse at how Mr. Trump plans to battle Democrats for control of the Senate. Both sides are fighting to attract voters who still support the president but may decide to keep their incumbent Democrats in Washington. Mr. Tester is one of 10 Senate Democrats up for re-election this year in states where Mr. Trump beat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

Republicans hold 51 seats in the Senate, compared with 49 controlled by Democrats. The GOP is aiming to pick off a few of the Trump-state Democrats to offset any losses they experience in November so they can protect or expand their caucus. Of the 10 red-state Democrats, four are listed by Cook Political Report as tossups; three Republican-held seats are ranked the same way. Mr. Tester’s race is rated as likely to remain in the Democratic column.

Mr. Trump’s remarks turned beyond 2018 to the 2020 race as well. At one point, the president described a possible debate between him and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has said she has Native American ancestry. Mr. Trump has regularly derided her assertion and used an insulting nickname for her.

In this hypothetical debate, Mr. Trump said he would toss her a genealogy test kit when she mentioned her ancestry. “But we have to do it gently because we’re in the Me Too generation, so we have to be very gentle,” he said, referencing current concerns about sexual harassment and abuse.

The president said he would pay $1 million to Ms. Warren’s favorite charity if she would take the test “and it shows you’re an Indian.”

Ms. Warren responded to Mr. Trump on Twitter by pointing to his administration’s efforts to use DNA tests to reunite families separated at the border, after children were placed in government care when their parents were arrested.

“While you obsess over my genes, your Admin is conducting DNA tests on little kids because you ripped them from their mamas & you are too incompetent to reunite them in time to meet a court order,” she said. “Maybe you should focus on fixing the lives you’re destroying.”

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It may soon become difficult to determine who sits in the hotter seat: U.S. President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh or Senate Democrats from conservative states who must decide whether they are jeopardizing their political careers by opposing him.

Trump, a Republican, named Kavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge from Washington, to the highest court on Monday, setting the stage for a political fight that could consume the weeks before the congressional elections in November.

Conservative advocacy groups are ready to pressure five moderate Senate Democrats to support Kavanaugh, all of whom are up for reelection in states that overwhelmingly backed Trump in his presidential run. They argue that not doing so will damage the senators politically.

The Senate must confirm Trump’s nominee by a majority vote. The president’s party holds 51 of 100 Senate seats, so liberal groups will apply pressure on those same Democrats to hold firm against Kavanaugh because the loss of only a Republican vote or two could sink the nomination.

“They are stuck between a rock and a hard place,” said Ford O’Connell, a Republican strategist.

Three of those largely rural state Democrats, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, voted to confirm Trump’s previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, last year. All three have touted their ability to work with Trump on various issues.

The other two Democrats in so-called red states that lean Republican, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Jon Tester of Montana, are also at risk of losing their seats.

“Obstructing confirmation will only backfire on vulnerable red-state Democrats and show voters that all their talk of bipartisanship is nothing but hot air,” Katie Martin, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which backs Republican Senate candidates, told Reuters.

To that end, the Judicial Crisis Network, which pushes for conservative judicial nominees, will launch a $1.4 million ad campaign targeting Donnelly, Heitkamp, and Manchin, according to a representative for the group.

POLITICAL DYNAMIC

Americans for Prosperity, a conservative policy advocacy group backed by the influential Koch network, has planned a seven-figure ad campaign to support Kavanaugh, as it did last year on behalf of Gorsuch, as well as mounting a grassroots campaign in Indiana, North Dakota, and West Virginia.

Trump himself has been keenly aware of the political dynamic involved. The White House invited on Monday several vulnerable Democratic senators to the event naming Kavanaugh in order to place maximum pressure on their vote. Each declined.

As a counterweight, a new liberal interest group, Demand Justice, plans to spend as much as $5 million to push the moderate Democrats to hold fast against the nominee, as well as attempt to persuade moderate Republican senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska to oppose Kavanaugh.

Democrats have another reason to worry about the impact of the Supreme Court nomination, said Stuart Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst in Washington. The red-state senators’ support for Kavanaugh could dampen the Democratic Party’s anti-Trump enthusiasm and, as a result, reduce voter turnout in the congressional elections.

Still, Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist and former top aide to Manchin, warned that Democratic leaders such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer should not force at-risk Democrats to oppose Kavanaugh if it isn’t in their best interests. “They have to speak for themselves,” he said.

While Collins, Murkowski and Donnelly were non-committal on Monday night, Manchin spoke up after Trump’s pick was announced.

He said on Twitter he would decide whether to support Kavanaugh based on whether the nominee would vote to invalidate sections of the Affordable Care Act, which guarantees insurance coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions.

WASHINGTON (AP) — If Donald Trump Jr. is worried, he sure doesn`t show it.

His father, the president, is reported to be fretting about his eldest son`s entanglement in the Russia investigation. And Don Jr.`s role in the special counsel`s probe continues to throw off headlines. But the 40-year-old son is hardly ducking his head.

He`s beloved on the right as the swaggering embodiment of the Make America Great Again agenda. And he`s embracing his role as a popular emissary for his father, crisscrossing the country on campaign trips, penning op-eds in support of favored candidates and showcasing his new relationship with former Fox News host Kim Guilfoyle.

Unbowed and unapologetic, the son`s approach appears to mirror the father`s combative defiance toward special counsel`s Robert Mueller`s investigation. The enthusiastic reception he receives in many Republican strongholds is more evidence that Trump voters are rallying around the president`s criticism of the probe — perhaps even fired up by the fight.

Trump Jr. has downplayed any talk of his own legal exposure stemming from his involvement in a 2016 Trump Tower meeting that`s a focus of Mueller`s investigation into possible links between the president`s election campaign and Russia. The president recently unleashed a series of angry tweets on the subject, and in one he acknowledged that his son set up the meeting to seek damaging information about Democrat Hillary Clinton from a Kremlin-connected lawyer.

In another political era, that`s the sort of uncomfortable fact that could make someone a pariah on the campaign trail. Today, Trump Jr. is a sought-after surrogate.

He`s stumped in West Virginia, Montana, Florida and Kansas in recent months. In the coming weeks, he`s expected to campaign in Missouri, Indiana and North Dakota.

""He`s one of the top draws, if not the top draw for people not named President Trump,"" says Jason Miller, a top aide to the 2016 Trump campaign.

His appeal was clear in Great Falls, Montana, recently where he was cheered as he discussed his love of hunting in the state and laid into Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.

""Just because Donald Trump isn`t on the ticket in 2018 doesn`t mean that everything he has accomplished is not on the ticket,"" Trump Jr. said, adding: ""I`m going to be coming a lot out here in this fall, helping all of these guys.""

He welcomed Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines and Rep. Greg Gianforte onto the stage. Invited to speak, Daines said, ""Donald Trump Jr. is a heck of a shot.""

And the Mueller investigation?

""I never see anybody at any of these events, nobody even brings it up,"" Miller said. ""The base loves him because he`s a true believer.""

In fact, the legal concerns may work in his favor, says Sam Nunberg, a consultant who was a political adviser to the Trump 2016 campaign. ""It actually helps him because he`s being persecuted,"" says Nunberg. ""Don is the biggest asset of all the kids. He`s a guy`s guy. He understands the movement. And knows how to communicate it.""

Trump Jr. has long been the Trump child most in touch with the president`s most ardent voters. He seems to relish the button-pushing, asserting or trolling Tweet. His Twitter feed has traded in conspiracy theories and hard-line messages about immigration or gun control. He once circulated a post that compared Syrian refugees to a bowl of Skittles candy that contained some that ""would kill you.""

""He`s someone who like the president can rile up the base and get party activists excited,"" said Republican strategist Ryan Williams. ""He`s probably not someone you`re going to send to a swing district, but in a red state he may be able to draw out some base voters.""

Republicans say Trump Jr. shows few signs of being rattled by the attention. He is not talking much privately about the investigation and tends to dismiss the scrutiny as mere media fixation, according to a person familiar with his thinking who demanded anonymity to discuss private conversations.

Trump Jr.`s allies believe he`s being held to a higher standard than others and that any campaign would have taken the meeting with someone offering dirt on an opponent.

But his legal woes have not been so easily brushed off by his father.

The president has stewed over the media coverage of the federal trial of Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman, who has been charged with financial fraud as part of the Mueller probe. Though the trial is not connected to Russian election interference, Trump has seethed to confidants that he views the Manafort charges as ""a warning shot"" from Mueller. He has told those close to him that as he watches the courtroom proceedings, he fears that Donald Trump Jr. could at some point be the one on trial, according to two people familiar with his thinking but not authorized to discuss private conversations.

Despite his behind-closed-doors concerns, the president publicly denies that he is worried about his son. While doing so on Twitter in recent days, he offered a new — and potentially legally damaging — explanation of why his son is under such legal scrutiny.

""Fake News reporting, a complete fabrication, that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son, Donald, had in Trump Tower,"" Trump tweeted last Sunday. ""This was a meeting to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere. I did not know about it!""

Trump Jr. has acknowledged that he took the meeting in anticipation of receiving dirt about Clinton.

""To the extent that they had information concerning the fitness, character or qualifications of any presidential candidate, I believed that I should at least hear them out,"" he told Senate staff in a private interview last year.

Trump Jr. told investigators his father was never advised about the arrangement.

Federal law makes it a crime for a campaign to knowingly accept or solicit a ""thing of value"" from foreign nationals. But Trump Jr. has said he received nothing of value during the meeting, which he has suggested was ultimately a waste of time. He declined to comment for this article but has not shied from the limelight as he campaigns around the country.

In a recent interview with TV host Laura Ingraham, he angrily deemed the matter a Democratic conspiracy.

The meeting lasted 20 minutes and ""ended up being about essentially nothing that was relevant to any of these things,"" he said. ""That`s all it is and that`s all they`ve got.""

"“The VA must immediately take steps” to repair the VA’s caregiver program, according to Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs.

WASHINGTON—A multimillion-dollar Department of Veterans Affairs initiative to help people who care for disabled veterans suffers from poor support for the ailing, delays in funding for caregivers, and other problems, according to the department’s internal watchdog.

The VA’s family caregiver program was established in 2012 to provide financial assistance and emotional support to family members and others who care for severely disabled veterans. These caregivers, veterans groups say, have long gone largely unrecognized and uncompensated.

A report by the VA Inspector General’s office said that, even as the budget has increased, the program has been unable to handle the crush of requests to join it, according to investigators who looked at statistics spanning January to September of last year.

For “the caregivers—and the veterans themselves—it’s not clear to them why they are qualified or not qualified (for benefits),” said Darin Selnick, a senior adviser with Concerned Veterans for America. He previously was a veterans affairs adviser to the Trump administration.

“There’s no standard consistency in the way it’s done and implemented,” he added.

Under department rules, applications to the program were supposed to be processed in 45 days, but most vets waited at least 3 months, according to the report. Some 14% waited a half year or more.

Veterans can be discharged from the program as their health improves, but the VA is supposed to closely follow up with those vets and their caregivers. Inspectors say the VA didn’t consistently monitor or document 50% of veterans discharged from the program.

Many of these issues stemmed from an extensive workload and inadequate staffing, inspectors said.

“The VA must immediately take steps to adequately staff and overhaul the way it manages the Caregiver Support Program,” said Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs.

Veterans and families who depend on the program have long complained of unpredictable management.

Holly Ferrell, of Franklin, Va., takes care of her husband, a veteran who suffers from severe anxiety and a shoulder injury. She said her husband’s case was alternately approved and rejected for the program by multiple caseworkers between 2013 and 2018. The letter dropping him from the program came with no explanation.

“Our letter, it simply says: ‘Veteran does not qualify for the caregiver program.’ One line, that’s all it is,” Ms. Ferrell said. After many appeals, she was able to get him reinstated.

Advocacy groups say they have scores of similar reports of veterans being cut from the program without explanation, or with conflicting reasons.

The VA didn’t respond to a request for comment.

In a written response included in the Inspector General’s report, Carolyn Clancy, the top VA medical official at the time, wrote that she agreed with the findings and that “activities are underway to develop improved efficiencies and standardization in the areas of monitoring and oversight.”

The caregiver program was first established under the Obama administration to help veterans injured in the wars following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. In 2012, the program’s first fully-established year, it had a budget of approximately $110 million. This year, it’s slated to spend more than seven times that much: $840 million.

As the popularity of the program grew, administrative functions didn’t keep up. Investigators found that the VA ran the program with interim rules for five years before issuing definitive regulations in 2017.

The department “failed to effectively run the family caregiver program because it didn’t establish governance that promoted accountability,” the inspectors said in the report.

The report comes as the VA prepares to open up the caregiver program to older veterans, a provision approved when President Trump signed new legislation, called the Mission Act, a major congressional initiative on veterans’ care.

At the June signing ceremony for the new legislation, Mr. Trump praised the caregiver provisions in the law. “If you wore that uniform, then you deserve our absolute best, and that’s what we’re doing, right?” he asked.

"JOPLIN, Mo.—In an RV emblazoned with her name, Sen. Claire McCaskill pulled in to a manufacturing plant in this deep-Republican part of the state to blast the administration for how it implemented tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Then she was asked where she stood on the president’s Supreme Court nominee.

The two-term Missouri Democrat said she had three topics of discussion for her meeting with Judge Brett Kavanaugh, set for Tuesday: money in politics, consumer protections in health care, and business consolidation. “I want to make sure Judge Kavanaugh has a feel for the little guy who is taking on Goliath.”

As a senator in a state President Trump won by 19 points, Ms. McCaskill summed up her vote on his nomination as “damned if you do and damned if you don’t.”

Ms. McCaskill is one of 10 senators set to vote on the nomination who are seeking re-election in states won by President Trump in 2016. A vote for Judge Kavanaugh could show Republican voters that they are willing to work with the president. But the activated Democratic base is pushing senators to reject him, worried it will solidify the court’s conservative majority.

Outside groups are ready to spend millions to lean on senators as the November midterm elections approach. The Koch-backed group Americans for Prosperity has digital ads supporting Judge Kavanaugh, targeting seven states Trump won that have Democratic senators.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee just bought $2.8 million in ads opposing Democratic Sens. Jon Tester of Montana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Ms. McCaskill. While the ads don’t focus on Judge Kavanaugh, they critique the senators for being liberal and against the president.

“For a red-state senator, a ‘yes’ vote allows to you burnish your bipartisan credentials and shows swing voters that you are not afraid to stand up to the liberal crowd,” said Jim Manley, a former Senate leadership aide. “But that is not going to play well in all the red states so I expect at least a few Democratic senators to vote ‘no’ in the end.”

Republicans control just 50 Senate votes, with Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) absent while he undergoes treatment for brain cancer. If Democrats unite in opposition, one Republican defection could derail a Senate vote. No Republicans have signaled opposition.

At a campaign stop this month in Springfield, Ms. McCaskill acknowledged the split over the vote. “People say, oh she’s trying to figure out how to vote, it will help her in the election,” she said. “I don’t believe there really is one side that is better than the other ‘politically.’ So in a way it’s kind of a blessing, it frees me up to do the right thing.”

After he finished giving Ms. McCaskill a tour at CNC Machine Products Inc. in Joplin, Rick Braddish, vice president of sales, said he thought he would support her—but her vote on the judge could sway him.

“I would have to think about it if she did vote against Kavanaugh, just because I like him,” he said. “I think our area of the country wants a more conservative court.”

Ms. McCaskill’s opponent, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, is making the vote on Judge Kavanaugh central to his campaign. His first television ad focused on the vacancy, airing the same day Mr. Trump unveiled his pick to succeed Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who announced his retirement in June.

“For so many Missouri voters, especially conservatives…the Supreme Court is one of the big reasons why they supported the president,” Mr. Hawley said in an interview after a rally in Blue Springs, a Kansas City suburb.

Democrats’ hopes surged Thursday when a CNN poll showed Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination had 37% public support, the lowest of any Supreme Court nominee in more than 30 years.

“There is no groundswell of support for Brett Kavanaugh to contend with, even in these deeply red states,” said Brian Fallon, the executive director of Demand Justice, a leading anti-Kavanaugh group.

Red-state senators up for re-election have been the first Democrats to meet with Judge Kavanaugh. The first three to do so—Mr. Manchin, Ms. Heitkamp and Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana—supported Mr. Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch. Ms. McCaskill was the fourth to announce a meeting. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York will also meet with Mr. Kavanaugh on Tuesday.

Two red-state senators are exceptions: Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin have joined Democrats including Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts—both considered potential 2020 presidential contenders—in opposing the nomination. Ms. McCaskill called that a mistake.

“I believe no one should make a decision on any Supreme Court nominee without taking the time to read the decisions, study the issues and meeting with the nominee,” she said. “I disagree with my colleagues who just immediately out of the gate said no.”

Even though he opposed Judge Kavanaugh, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D., Md.), who is leading the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm this cycle, isn’t pushing his colleagues to stand together, which they would need to do to block the nomination. Instead, he wants them to listen to voters.

“I think we should defeat Kavanaugh but that’s my opinion and every senator will have to make up his or her own mind,” he said in an interview.

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - One political analyst calls it “an almost impossible map.” Others are even less optimistic.

But despite the Democrats’ long odds to retake the U.S. Senate in November’s congressional elections, party strategists meeting in Chicago this week say the escalating legal troubles of President Donald Trump’s former associates and corruption scandals engulfing Republicans could boost Democrats chances.

The path, however, remains difficult.

Democrats are defending two dozen Senate seats this cycle - including 10 in states Trump won in 2016, some by huge margins. They need a net total of two seats to seize control of the chamber.

Having a majority would allow the party to derail or stall much of Trump’s policy agenda and increase congressional oversight and investigation of the administration, as well as complicate future conservative nominations to the U.S. Supreme Court should another vacancy occur.

Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, called the Senate landscape “an almost impossible map” for Democrats. But, he added, given the headwinds facing Republicans, “the Senate could be in play.”

In interviews at the Democratic National Committee’s summer meeting in Chicago, a dozen party strategists, party members and candidates discussed the party’s path and strategy to winning back the Senate, which Democrats last controlled in 2014.

CRITICAL CONTESTS

Democrats say five races are particularly difficult this year. They are spending hundreds of millions of dollars defending them. Losing just one of the seats in West Virginia, Indiana, North Dakota, Montana and Missouri - all won by Trump in 2016 - could doom any shot of retaking the Senate.

FILE PHOTO: Democratic candidates running for office across the U.S. are seen on a screen during an executive committee meeting at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) Summer Meeting in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., August 23, 2018. REUTERS/Daniel Acker/File Photo

An array of state polls give Democrats hope. Opinion surveys show toss-up races in North Dakota, Indiana and Missouri. In Montana, which Trump carried by 20 percentage points, incumbent Democratic Senator Jon Tester leads recent polls by an average of five percentage points. In West Virginia, which Trump carried by over 40 percentage points, Democratic Senator Joe Manchin is slightly ahead in recent polling.

“Those five states are clearly the biggest targets for Republicans,” said Geoffrey Skelley, a non-partisan analyst at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. “There’s two ways to look at the Senate map. It’s really bad for Democrats, but the flip side of this is that this is a perfect year for them to be defending it.”

A Republican operative working on Senate races said Democrats seeking re-election in states where Trump remains popular should be worried. “Their national party’s lurch to the left is doing nothing but turning off voters in these states and further damaging their vulnerable incumbents.”

Florida’s Senate fight concerns some Democrats. Polls show a tight race between incumbent Democratic Senator Bill Nelson and Republican challenger Rick Scott, the state’s governor. Scott led Nelson by six percentage points in a Florida Atlantic University poll released on Tuesday.

While straining to hold all the states Trump won, Democrats are also focused on Arizona and Nevada, which strategists said are crucial pick-ups for the party.

In Arizona, where Republican Jeff Flake is retiring, Republicans are in a three-way nominating contest ahead of voting next Tuesday. On the Democratic side, Kyrsten Sinema leads in polls.

Senator Dean Heller of Nevada is considered the most vulnerable Republican incumbent. Party strategists said his vote to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, has been a gift in a state with many retirees and where access to healthcare is a major issue.

Democrats need to hold all the states they are defending and win Nevada and Arizona to secure a one-seat Senate majority.

FOCUSING RESOURCES

Priorities USA and Senate Majority PAC, two Democratic Super PACs, are together spending at least $120 million on ads in Arizona, Nevada, West Virginia, Indiana, Montana, North Dakota and Indiana. Super PACs must operate separately from political campaigns but can raise and spend unlimited money.

The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee’s independent expenditure arm has made an initial television buy of $30 million in Arizona, Nevada, West Virginia, Indiana, Montana and North Dakota.

The party and outside groups also have started to pour resources into more long-shot opportunities to gain seats in Tennessee and Texas, Democrats said.

Recent polls have placed Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke within as few as two to four percentage points of Republican Senator Ted Cruz in Texas.

In Tennessee’s open race, former Democratic governor Phil Bredesen, a popular moderate, is now in a close race with Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn, according to polls.

HEALTHCARE, TAXES AND CORRUPTION TOUTED AS WINNING MESSAGE

Internal Democratic polling shows that healthcare and the Republican tax cuts that some voters view as a giveaway to wealthy Americans and corporations are winning issues for Democrats this November.

“Critical issues, like healthcare, are really important to voters. And Republicans thought the tax cuts would be a winning issue, but it’s turned into a loser,” said Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist at the Chicago gathering. “We have these big issue trends working in our favor.”

DNC chairman Tom Perez made clear that Democrats in Senate battles would highlight the legal troubles around Trump after the conviction this week of Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and the guilty plea by his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen.

Cohen pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges including tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations. He testified that Trump had directed him to pay hush money to two women who claimed they had affairs with Trump, and the payments were made to influence the 2016 presidential election.

Trump, who has denied the affairs, says he paid Cohen out of personal funds and that the payments were not intended to benefit his campaign but to resolve a personal matter.

“The culture of corruption from this Republican leadership is out of control,” Perez told the party’s meeting.", Democrats face `almost impossible map` to retake U.S. Senate ,8-2018
"It’s no surprise that campaign ads for Mike Braun, the Republican candidate for Senate in Indiana, feature President Trump. More striking: Democratic incumbent Joe Donnelly’s ads do, too.

The fight for the Senate is being fought on a deep red, pro-Trump battlefield that is dramatically different from the suburban landscape where the House majority will be won and lost.

Ten of the Senate Democrats up for re-election this year represent states that Mr. Trump won in 2016—five of them by 20 percentage points or more. By contrast, Hillary Clinton won 23 GOP-held districts considered competitive this year.

That is why Democrats’ chances for erasing Republicans’ narrow 51-49 Senate margin are longer than their prospects of winning the House majority, which would require them to flip 23 seats.

Taking a Seat Democrats are facing a higher number of competitive challenges in Senate races this fall than Republicans, and have to defend nearly three times as many seats overall.

In recent weeks, the Senate map has shifted for both parties: Democrats are worrying more than expected about deep-blue New Jersey, where Sen. Bob Menendez—whose trial on federal corruption charges ended last fall in a hung jury—faces a well-funded GOP opponent, Bob Hugin.

Republicans are more concerned than anyone thought possible about Texas, where Sen. Ted Cruz’s lead in polls over Democrat Rep. Beto O’Rourkeis narrowing.

Both parties are riveted on Florida, after the upset victory by Tallahassee MayorAndrew Gillum in the Aug. 28 Democratic gubernatorial primary. Some Democrats hope that having Mr. Gillum, an African-American, at the top of the ticket, will boost Democratic turnout for the close race between Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and the GOP nominee, outgoing Gov. Rick Scott.

President Trump has packed his fall schedule with campaign events, and GOP leaders have a game plan for extending his influence: After the president appears with GOP candidates before crowds of thousands and lays into their Democratic opponents, the footage is quickly sliced up and dropped into attack ads.

“You need a senator who doesn’t just talk like they’re from North Dakota but votes like they’re from North Dakota and that is Kevin Cramer, ” Mr. Trump said in an ad drawn from a rally for Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp’s GOP opponent.

Chris Hansen, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said that strategy sends a message to red-state Democrats: “The race doesn’t really start until Trump comes to town and burns your house down.”

While Democrats in some parts of the country are running full tilt anti-Trump, Senate Democrats in Trump country aren’t. Ms. Heitkamp, in one ad, brags that she votes with the president more than half the time. One of Mr. Donnelly’s ads says he is “joining with President Trump to build a wall and protect our borders.”

Before the president came to Montana to rally for his opponent, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester took out a full-page ad in a local paper welcoming Mr. Trump and thanking him for signing 16 bills he sponsored. Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) has an ad that documents his vote for funding to build Mr. Trump’s border wall.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D., Md.), chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said that is a smart way for red-state Democrats to appeal to voters who want a senator who gives priority to their state’s interests over partisanship.

“People want a senator who is going to be accountable to their state, not a rubber stamp” either to their party or President Trump, Mr. Van Hollen said.

Democrats will have a hard time picking up a net of two Senate seats to get a majority because they have 26 seats to defend, while Republicans are defending just nine.

Three Republican-held seats are considered tossups by the Cook Political Report: in Arizona, Nevada and Tennessee.

Five Democrats are in what Cook sees as tossup races: Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri as well as Sens. Nelson, Donnelly, Manchin and Heitkamp.

In three other states—Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania—Republicans see less hope for unseating incumbents than when the midterm cycle began.

New Jersey is a new source of concern to Democrats in the wake of ethics problems that have dogged Mr. Menendez. Mr. Hugin, a former pharmaceutical chief executive, had $8 million in campaign cash on hand as of June 30, to Mr. Menendez’s $6 million.

The DSCC jumped into the fray last week, spending more than $100,000 for an ad buy in conjunction with Mr. Menendez’s campaign.

The surprise for Republicans in Texas is that recent polls show Mr. Cruz’s advantage dwindling to single digits. In the last fundraising quarter he raised just $4 million to Mr. O’Rourke’s $10.4 million. Cruz supporters say they expect him to win, but are sounding the alarm. President Trump announced on Twitter Friday that he will do a “major rally” for Mr. Cruz in October.

Florida’s Senate race has promised to be a barn burner since Mr. Scott announced he would challenge Mr. Nelson. Republicans have attacked 74-year-old Mr. Nelson, a three-term senator, as a politician who has overstayed his welcome. Mr. Scott has begun to take a lead in polls since midsummer.

Democrats see Mr. Scott as a weak candidate because in banner GOP years of 2010 and 2014, he eked out victories of barely over 1 percentage point.

"An increasingly embattled President Donald Trump mentioned the “i-word” at a Republican rally in Montana on Thursday night — and told his supporters it will be their fault if he ends up getting impeached.

“If it does happen it is your fault because you did not go out and vote. You did not go out to vote, that is the only way it can happen.” President Donald Trump

“You are not just voting for a candidate, you are voting for which party controls Congress,” Trump said, according to CNN. “Very important thing. Very important thing.”

Trump was in Montana to stump for Senate candidate Matt Rosendale, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in a state that Trump won in 2016.

Trump attacked Tester for his role in derailing the nomination of Trump’s White House doctor, Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson, to lead the VA earlier this year. Jackson was forced to withdraw his nomination after allegations of drunken driving, overprescribing medications and a breach of patient privacy emerged. “What Tester did to Adm. Jackson should never, ever be allowed,” Trump said.

The president also assailed the New York Times and the anonymous author of an anti-Trump op-ed published Wednesday, apparently from a senior administration official. “Is it subversion, is it treason?” Trump asked the crowd. “Unelected, deep state operatives who defy the voters to push their own secret agendas are truly a threat to democracy itself,” Trump said, as he urged Times reporters to reveal the author.

"President Donald Trump thanked North Korea’s leader for his “unwavering faith” in him Thursday, as he suggested a trade fight with Japan was coming and prepared to head to Montana for a “Make America Great Again” rally.

‘WE WILL GET IT DONE TOGETHER!’

Trump tweeted his thanks to Kim Jong Un after the North Korean leader said he trusted the president and was willing to take more active measures toward denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.

“We will get it done together!” Trump said. The exchange of words came after Trump’s abrupt cancelation last month of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s visit to North Korea, citing a lack of progress on denuclearization.

Also see: Trump says ‘no reason’ for joint military exercises with South Korea.

Trump also made comments on the prospect of Israeli-Palestinian peace in a pre-Rosh Hashanah call with Jewish leaders, saying “all my life I’ve heard that’s the hardest deal to make, and I’m starting to believe that maybe it is. But I will say that if it can be delivered, we will deliver it.”

JAPAN TRADE FIGHT ON HORIZON?

Wall Street Journal columnist James Freeman wrote that Trump called him and sounded bothered by the terms of U.S. trade with Japan. Freeman writes the president talked about his good relations with Japan’s leadership but said, “of course that will end as soon as I tell them how much they have to pay.”

The U.S. had a trade deficit of $69 billion with Japan in 2017.

Mass shootings, including those in Las Vegas and Parkland, Fla., have thrust the issue of gun control into midterm races that will determine whether Republicans hold control of Congress and maintain dominance in state capitals. Ads promoting stricter gun regulations have aired 102,636 times across the country this year—a 22-fold increase from four years ago, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Kantar Media/CMAG data.

From behind the wheel, steering toward the Las Vegas Strip, the Democratic candidate for Nevada governor says in one of his campaign ads, “I’ll never forget driving down after the shooting.”

Steve Sisolak, now the commissioner of Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, was talking about Oct. 1, 2017, when a gunman killed 58 concertgoers from a hotel room perch. “When I’m governor, we’re going to ban assault rifles, bump stocks, silencers,” he says in the ad. “We need to take action.”

State Attorney General Adam Laxalt, the Republican challenging Mr. Sisolak, opposes gun-control measures and has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association. He hasn’t mentioned guns in any of his ads.

Steve Sisolak’s campaign features images of Las Vegas after the shooting there last year.

Americans are more likely to see political ads promoting gun control than ones opposing stricter regulations, a reversal from four years ago. In Nevada and Florida, the turnabout is striking: Those states went from zero pro-gun control ads in 2014 to more than 45,000 this year.

The Journal reviewed Kantar Media data about gun and immigration advertising by House, Senate and gubernatorial candidates and the groups helping them from Jan. 1 to Sept. 9, as well as a similar data set from the same period for the previous midterm election. Much of the advertising occurred in primary races, and there have been more competitive Democratic contests this year.

When guns come up in races rated as tossups by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, the messaging is more likely to be pro-gun control, another sign that Democratic candidates see the issue as highly motivating to their base of voters. In tossup House races, 93% of gun-related ads favored stricter gun control.

Of the 38,199 gun-related ads in Florida, 34,812 had pro-gun control messages and were shown during the crowded Democratic gubernatorial primary. So far guns have been absent from the Senate race, where Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson faces Republican Gov. Rick Scott. Their campaigns didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Mr. Nelson had no primary and has aired few commercials so far. Mr. Scott has aired many dozens of ads as he fended off Republican primary challengers.

Mr. Sisolak’s campaign said that even before the Las Vegas shooting, there was a hunger among voters to talk about responsible gun ownership, and he will continue that kind of messaging in the general election.

Montana Republican Matt Rosendale’s ad is punctuated with the sound of a gunshot.

Some candidates are touting their high NRA ratings, including Kevin Nicholson, the Republican Senate candidate in Wisconsin, and Matt Rosendale, a Republican running for Senate in Montana. One of Mr. Rosendale’s ads concludes: “When it comes to our gun rights—” Bang! A gun fires. “I’ll always side with you.”

The NRA has only just begun spending money in midterms races, the group says. It has already sponsored political ads in Montana and West Virginia—Trump-voting states where Democrats are defending Senate seats.

Gun control advocacy groups have grown in size and number over the past four years. Everytown for Gun Safety, an organization largely funded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, plans to spend at least $8 million on midterms, including on TV ads and with contributions to candidates.

One election after Mr. Trump made ending illegal immigration a cornerstone of his campaign, political candidates are continuing to capitalize on the debate, with far heavier advertising on the topic than in the previous midterm election. Immigration has ballooned from taking up a 4% share of advertising messaging in 2014 to 16% this year, according to Kantar Media.

Immigration rhetoric similar to Mr. Trump’s—build a wall along the southern border, punish illegal immigrants, deny citizenship to border crossers—dominates, making up 83% of the 269,809 immigration ads.

Indiana, far from the Mexican border, and with just 5% of its population born in a foreign country, is awash in ads with anti-immigration messaging. No other Senate race features as many of those kinds of ads, in part because of a bitterly fought Republican primary.

Ad mentions for Governor, House and Senate races by type of ad Democratic Republican Anti-immigration 222,868 2018 2014 36,095 Pro-immigration 45,680 2018 2014 3,211 Immigration ads as a share of all ads 15.8% 2018 3.7 2014 Ad mentions for Governor, House and Senate races by type of ad Republican Democratic Anti-immigration 222,868 2018 2014 36,095 Pro-immigration 45,680 2018 2014 3,211 Immigration ads as a share of all ads 15.8% 2018 3.7 2014 Ad mentions for Governor, House and Senate races by type of ad Democratic Republican Anti-immigration 222,868 2018 2014 36,095 Pro-immigration 45,680 2018 2014 3,211 Immigration ads as a share of all ads 15.8% 2018 3.7 2014 Ad mentions for Governor, House and Senate races by type of ad Republican Democratic Anti-immigration 222,868 2018 2014 36,095 Pro-immigration 45,680 2018 2014 3,211 Immigration ads as a share of all ads 15.8% 2018 3.7 2014

Mike Braun, a former state assemblyman, won. His campaign mentions immigration in several ads without making it a central theme, but the conservative outside group One Nation has four different ads that are more direct: “We need tough immigration enforcement to keep dangerous criminals out,” a narrator in one spot says as a shadowy, knife-wielding man wearing a hood walks down a dark street.

“Immigration issues now resonate far from the border and more people are concerned about the lack of rule of law in this arena,” said Chris Pack, a spokesman for One Nation, which doesn’t disclose its donors and has limits on how much overtly political advertising it can air.

Mr. Braun’s Democratic opponent, Sen. Joe Donnelly, who is fighting for re-election in a state Mr. Trump won, has shown anti-immigration ads, as well. TV viewers in the state aren’t seeing any pro-immigration messages. In a recent spot, Mr. Donnelly says of Mr. Trump, “When he’s for Hoosiers, I’m with him. Like our fight to secure the southern border and to take on the opioid epidemic.” Other ads remind viewers that Mr. Donnelly joined “with President Trump to build a wall and protect our borders” and broke “with his own party to oppose sanctuary cities.”

In all, nearly 97% of immigration ads in the Senate races nationwide, for both parties, track with policies similar to Mr. Trump’s.

"With the fight over Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court behind them, Republicans and Democrats head into the midterm-election homestretch trying to channel passions churned in recent weeks into getting their supporters to the polls.

After the new justice was sworn in Saturday following a Senate vote confirming his nomination, he could join the court to hear his first oral arguments as soon as Tuesday, where he will immediately cement a conservative majority. The spotlight will continue to be trained on him by both adversaries and allies, while the political polarization seen in his nomination fight threatens to undermine public confidence in the Supreme Court’s impartiality, testing Chief Justice John Roberts.

But the focus of the next several weeks will be the crucial November elections, as raw emotions stirred by multiple allegations of sexual misconduct lodged against Justice Kavanaugh and a fight over a reopened FBI probe have energized voters from both parties. Republicans have been invigorated by their goal of reshaping the federal judiciary, and the women’s “#MeToo” movement has fueled a rise in female Democratic candidates.

President Trump, at a Kansas rally after the Senate vote on Saturday, portrayed Democratic attacks on Justice Kavanaugh and the tactics of those protesting his nomination in Washington as emblematic of what would come from giving Democrats control of Congress.

“Just imagine the devastation they would cause if they ever obtain the power they so desperately want and crave,” the Republican president said.

Democrats portrayed Republican handling of the sexual-assault allegations, which Justice Kavanaugh has denied, as an illustration of the GOP’s win-at-all-costs attitude.

“All of these angry people out there, they know that it is the people who are sitting in the Senate that they’ve elected who are making these decisions,” said Sen. Mazie Hirono (D., Hawaii), a leading Kavanaugh critic, on CNN Sunday. “And they’re going to go to the polls and they’re going to vote differently.”

Analysts said that based on polls, the Kavanaugh fight in the short term likely improves Republicans’ chances of keeping control of the Senate and reduces their odds of keeping their House majority. The fight for the Senate is being waged mostly in states where the president and his court pick are popular, while the House battleground is mostly suburban districts more opposed to the president.

“Our energy and enthusiasm was lagging behind theirs until this,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) on CBS Sunday. “And I think this gave us the motivation and the opportunity to have the kind of turnout in this off-year election that would help us hold the Senate.”

Democratic activists, who organized demonstrations around the Capitol while the Senate met Saturday, said they hope to turn the energy from the streets to the ballot box—especially among women.

“This confirmation process has been an all-out war on women,” Linda Sarsour, an organizer of the 2017 Women’s March, held a day after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, said in a fundraising email Friday. “We have to fight harder than ever to win the Senate.”

Over the longer term, the Kavanaugh fight could reinforce an alignment of the parties that has been accelerated by the Trump presidency: The Republican Party’s core constituency increasingly is centered on white men, while the Democratic Party is home to many people of color and a rising share of female voters.

A record number of women are running for office up and down the ballot—the overwhelming majority of them as Democrats—and many women have turned to political activism for the first time in response to the 2016 election.

Newsletter Sign-up

A September Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that women want Democrats rather than Republicans to control Congress, by 58% to 33%, a 25 percentage-point margin. Men favored Republican control by 3 percentage points, 47% to 44%.

Women were more likely to oppose the nomination of now-Justice Kavanaugh. Even before a hearing where Christine Blasey Ford testified about her claims that he sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, the Journal/NBC poll found 28% of women supported his nomination while 42% opposed. Among men, 41% supported and 33% opposed. The judge denied the claims.

“I really think this is going to drive women out to the polls in unprecedented numbers,” said Katie Hill, a Democratic House candidate in California.

Run for Something, a group established after the 2016 election to help political newcomers run for office, said that, in the days around the Senate Judiciary Committee’s final Kavanaugh hearing, the number of people signing up to work on campaigns and run for future office spiked.

Among the new volunteers was Libby Eismeier, a 33-year-old mother of three in Indiana, who signed up for campaign work for the first time after one of her senators, Republican Todd Young, said on Facebook he believed Justice Kavanaugh.

Some Republicans argue that women were already so mobilized in opposition to Mr. Trump that the Kavanaugh episode probably didn’t add much to their ranks. The Kavanaugh confirmation fulfilled one of the most important 2016 promises that drove GOP voters to Mr. Trump, especially evangelical conservatives who had qualms about his lifestyle.

“Christian conservatives will feel like Trump upheld his end of the bargain,” said GOP pollster Whit Ayres. Meanwhile, “Democratic enthusiasm in the midterms will go even higher, if that’s possible.”

Republicans are encouraged by signs the controversy also has increased the political engagement of GOP voters, helping to close the “enthusiasm gap” that has given Democrats an edge.

“Republicans are back in the game and for a while, before the hearings, we looked lost,” said Katon Dawson, former chairman of the South Carolina GOP.

The National Republican Congressional Committee is seeing a surge in low-dollar donations. The amount raised in the first week of October was more than four times that raised a month earlier.

But an energized base will get the GOP only so far in suburban districts where Mr. Trump is less popular.

The nonpartisan Cook Political Report since late September has downgraded Republicans’ chances of winning House races in 13 districts. There are 15 GOP-held House districts that Cook rates as likely to go Democratic or leaning that way. Another 29 are considered tossups. Democrats need a net gain of 23 seats to win the majority.

Meanwhile, the Cook report upgraded Republican chances in three Senate races but downgraded them in three others since late September.

One question is whether the Kavanaugh effect will soon be supplanted by some other national or international firestorm. Mr. Trump isn’t likely to let attention to his victory fade as he holds rallies in battleground states over the next month. Mr. McConnell says he will keep the Supreme Court before voters on the campaign trail.

“It mesmerized the country and we intend of course to be talking about it in the campaigns,” Mr. McConnell said in a Saturday interview. “Nothing unifies Republicans like the courts.”

Republican candidates already cite the Kavanaugh fight on the campaign trail.

“It’s what we hate most about Washington,” says an ad for Republican challenger Matt Rosendale’s campaign against Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, calling the Kavanaugh attacks a “liberal smear.”

For Democrats, the Kavanaugh debate was particularly nettlesome for 10 senators up for re-election in states that Mr. Trump won in 2016.

Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota was already lagging behind GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer in polls when she announced her opposition to Justice Kavanaugh. In a sign of GOP confidence, the National Republican Senatorial Committee has canceled some of their October advertising in that race.

Ms. Heitkamp this weekend released a new campaign ad to explain why she voted against Mr. Kavanaugh—because she didn’t think he was truthful or unbiased—and to remind voters that she had backed Mr. Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch.

In West Virginia, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin has been leading in polls over state attorney general Pat Morrissey. Republicans saw their best hope for beating him in the possibility he would vote against Justice Kavanaugh. He did not.

In Tennessee, another deep-red state, Democratic Senate candidate Phil Bredesen announced Friday he would have voted for Justice Kavanaugh if he was in the Senate at the time.

Messrs. Manchin and Bredesen risked alienating Democrats they need to win their tough races. Priorities USA Action, one of the best-funded Democratic super PACs, and the liberal group MoveOn.org said they wouldn’t contribute to either senator because of their support for Justice Kavanaugh.

President Donald Trump revived a derogatory term he has previously used to reference Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts while speaking at a campaign rally for Republican state auditor Matt Rosendale in Montana on Thursday.

""She`s based her life on being a minority. `Pocahontas,` they always want me to apologize for saying it,"" Trump said. ""Pocahontas, I apologize to you. I apologize. To you, I apologize. To the fake Pocahontas, I won`t apologize.""

Trump accused Warren of using her self-described heritage to advance her political career and taunted her by suggesting she should take an ancestry test. Fact-checkers were previously unable to determine whether Warren is of Native American heritage, but, according to their findings, the lack of proof did not ""preclude Warren from having traces of Native American heritage.""

Trump also sniped at the #MeToo movement during his monologue on Warren`s genealogy:

""I`m going to get one of those little kits, and in the middle of the debate when she proclaims that she`s of Indian heritage, because her mother says she has high cheekbones,"" Trump said. ""We will take that little kit and ... we have to do it gently because we`re in the `MeToo` generation so we have to be very gentle.""

""And we will very gently take that kit, and we will slowly toss it,"" Trump continued. ""Hoping it doesn`t hit her and injure her arm. Even though it only weighs probably two ounces.""

The #MeToo movement is dedicated to exposing rampant sexual misconduct and sexual harassment across multiple industries, which has taken down multiple high-profile figures since it began. Trump appears to have conflated it with being polite.

Warren has previously voiced her support for the movement.

Incidentally, Trump`s remarks the same day the White House announced that former Fox News executive Bill Shine will join the White House as the next deputy chief of staff for communications. Shine stepped down as co-president at Fox News in 2017. He was close to the embattled chairman and CEO Roger Ailes, who had faced multiple allegations of sexual misconduct.

Shine was accused of trying to cover up allegations against Ailes, who left the network in July 2016, and died nearly one year later.

Shortly after Trump threw darts at Warren on Thursday, Warren fired back, noting the Trump administration was conducting DNA tests on separated migrant families. On Thursday, the Department of Health and Human Services announced it would conduct DNA tests as part of the effort to reunite migrant children who were separated from their parents as a result of the White House`s ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy.", Trump mocks #MeToo movement in derogatory rant about Elizabeth Warren at Montana campaign rally ,10-2018

"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his caucus will likely endure some liberal criticism for accepting the deal. | Alex Brandon/AP Photo Congress Democrats agree to confirmations of 15 Trump judges In exchange, Dems facing reelection can go home to campaign.

Senate Democrats accepted an offer Thursday from Senate Republicans to confirm 15 lifetime federal judges in exchange for the ability to go into recess through the midterms, allowing endangered Democrats to campaign.

The calculation by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his caucus was simple: That Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) would be able to confirm roughly 15 judges if he kept the Senate in session for the next few weeks anyway. So Democrats OK’d an offer to confirm three Circuit Court judges and 12 Circuit Court judges as the price to pay to go home for election season.

Story Continued Below

Under Senate rules, even if Democrats fought the nominees tooth and nail and forced the Senate to burn 30 hours of debate between each one, McConnell would have gotten them all confirmed by Nov. 1. Democrats could have conceivably left a skeleton crew of senators in Washington to force the GOP to take roll call votes on the judges over the next few weeks, although that tactic is not typically employed by the minority.

Some liberal activists are urging Democrats to show more fight after Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court; Markos Moulitsas of Daily Kos even said that Democrats “need a new Senate leader” after the agreement was struck. But senators had to weigh that dynamic along with the approaching midterms and the brutal Senate map. And with a half-dozen Democrats facing serious challenges in Senate races, it made more sense to make what Democrats said was a reasonable deal with McConnell so that they could make a serious run at saving endangered senators.

Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) deadpanned that he was “tickled” pink that he could go home and campaign in Montana, where his race against Matt Rosendale is tightening.

“If we stayed here for two or three weeks, we’d probably have done the same thing,” Tester said. “I think it’s good.”

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren told the caucus that she opposed the deal, the lone Democrat to voice displeasure, according to a person briefed on the meeting.

McConnell and President Donald Trump will now have confirmed 84 judges over the past two years, including two Supreme Court nominees, after the deal. Democrats also allowed a package of judges to be confirmed in August as a condition of going home.

Though Senate Democratic leaders advised the agreement to their members on Thursday afternoon, several senators said on the way to the votes they were unaware what exactly their leadership had just agreed to. Any Democrat could have objected to the deal as McConnell read it on the Senate floor, but none did.

“I am surprised,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas). “The difficulty [Democrats] have is an angry base after the Kavanaugh confirmation, and trying to explain to them this is a necessary thing to do. That’s why Sen. Schumer gets paid the big bucks.”

One nominee Democrats loathed, Thomas Farr for a federal district court judgeship in North Carolina, was left out of the package.

Senate Democrats have privately argued it’s in the party’s best interest to allow quick confirmation of judges in order to let endangered red state senators go home and campaign. But Schumer and his caucus immediately endured some liberal criticism for accepting the deal.

Vanita Gupta, who leads the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, called it “appalling” for the Senate to confirm those nominees without debate. And Demand Justice, a group started to fight Trump’s court picks that spent considerable amounts during the Kavanaugh fight, called the deal “totally unnecessary.”

“It is a bitter pill to swallow so soon after the Kavanaugh fight that so many progressive activists poured their hearts and souls into. This period will be long remembered not just for the historic number of judges Trump has been able to confirm, but also because of how passive Democrats were in response,” said Demand Justice chief counsel Chris Kang. “The progressive grass-roots have awoken to the crisis of Trump’s takeover of the courts, and are not going to tolerate this kind of weakness for much longer.”

But Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), who could conceivably mount a comeback in her state with retail politics, missed Thursday’s Senate session anyway, and there likely would have been more defections next week if the Senate hadn`t taken the deal.

And some Republicans said they were willing to keep the Senate in session to do more. Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) said he was happy with the progress McConnell has made, but he said he’d prefer the Senate stay in session this October and confirm even more of Trump`s nominees, particularly those to the executive branch.

“I give Mitch McConnell all the credit in the world for his perseverance,” Perdue said. But he added that the backlog of executive branch nominees mean “the administration hasn’t been able to form it’s government yet ... I’m ready to stay here next week, the next couple of weeks, whatever it takes.”", Democrats agree to confirmations of 15 Trump judges ,10-2018
"(Reuters) - Democratic candidates for the U.S. Congress are closing out the campaign season with an ominous warning: telling voters millions of Americans could lose their health insurance or be forced to pay significantly more if Republicans win.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday shows why they are hammering the message: 58 percent of likely voters want to keep former President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act.

Among other things, the law protected insurance coverage for people with pre-existing health conditions. The poll, conducted Oct. 12-17, also showed that eight in 10 likely voters from each major party want to protect coverage for people with existing conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes or cancer.

With the Nov. 6 elections looming, Democrats are reminding voters of Republicans’ often-repeated promises to repeal the 2010 law. Many Republican candidates are softening their tone or removing website references decrying what they long derided as “Obamacare,” according to candidates, analysts and healthcare experts in both parties.

As Democrats seek to take control of Congress, they see Republicans as having a particularly weak spot on healthcare. Sixty-seven of the 73 most vulnerable Republican incumbents in the House of Representatives voted at least once to eliminate the ACA and its protections for pre-existing conditions, according to the Center for American Progress Action Fund.

Some of those votes date back to the Obama administration, though his successor, Republican President Donald Trump, also campaigned on a promise to undo the law. A repeal attempt after Trump took office last year failed.

Opinion polls show Democrats as having a chance to achieve the net gain of 23 seats they would need to take a majority in the House, but facing a longer shot at picking up the two seats they need to take control of the Senate.

Democratic activists said the repeated Republican attempts to repeal the ACA provide a powerful tool to motivate voters.

“Healthcare has an ability to move people into action,” said Ben Wikler, Washington director of liberal activist group MoveOn. “It is turning people out in town hall meetings ... getting people to make hundreds of thousands of phone calls and getting voters to the polls.”

‘ANXIOUS’ ABOUT HEALTHCARE

One sign of Democratic focus: 54.5 percent of Democrats’ federal election ads from Sept. 18 to Oct. 15 mentioned healthcare, far more than the 8.7 percent that did so at the same time in 2010, according to the Wesleyan Media Project.

Some 33.9 percent of Republican federal election ads mentioned healthcare during this period and 31.5 percent in 2010. Republicans took control of the House in the 2010 midterm elections, boosted in part by opposition to the ACA, which had become law earlier that year.

While the aim of the ACA was to expand healthcare insurance to reach millions of Americans who did not have any coverage, Republicans campaigned for years against it as government overreach, especially its requirement that people buy health insurance or pay a financial penalty.

U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill has made healthcare the focus of her campaign in Missouri against Republican challenger Josh Hawley. The state’s attorney general, Hawley has faced criticism from individuals and healthcare groups for saying he supports covering pre-existing conditions even after suing to end the ACA.

“Everyone is feeling anxious and worried about the future of healthcare,” McCaskill said in a telephone interview. “It’s beginning to dawn on people that the Republicans didn’t have a replacement (for the ACA), and that they have no ideas on how they could do it better.”

Hawley ran for state attorney general by emphasizing his role in a lawsuit against the ACA that went to the U.S. Supreme Court, and also worked on a team that successfully challenged the ACA’s requirement to provide contraceptives coverage.

Hawley declined interview requests.

‘IT HAD BECOME REAL’

Despite Republican opposition, eight years after its passage many Americans have seen some benefits from the law.

“By the time Republicans last year tried to repeal the law, it had become real, people had benefited,” said Brad Woodhouse, executive director of Protect Our Care. He said at least 20 Republican incumbents have “scrubbed” their websites to appear more supportive of the law.

In Kentucky, Representative Andy Barr has called his vote to repeal the ACA “a great day for freedom in America” but now plays up his support of programs to prevent and treat opioid addiction. In Maine, Representative Bruce Poliquin dropped a promise to “end Obamacare” and now talks about protecting hospitals.

Ted Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, said during a debate this month against Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke that he would protect pre-existing illnesses, despite having once forced a shutdown of the federal government over ACA repeal efforts.

In a hotly contested upstate New York congressional race, Democratic challenger Antonio Delgado has hammered his opponent, first-term Republican John Faso, over his vote to repeal the ACA.

“John Faso, despite voting to take away protections, is running TV ads saying the exact opposite,” he said during a recent town hall meeting. “How can you look someone in the face and say, ‘No, I didn’t do that.’ After a while, you’re just lying to our faces blatantly. This is too real to lie about.”

Faso defended his vote in an interview, saying New York state law already ensures patients with pre-existing conditions are protected, regardless of federal legislation.

DIM VIEW OF HEALTHCARE

Despite support for specific elements of the law, 52 percent of likely voters told Reuters/Ipsos they view the U.S. healthcare system as “poor” or “terrible.”

Some 27 percent blame Democrats and Obama for the system, while 20 percent view Republicans and Trump as responsible.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,792 adults including 925 likely voters. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire sample and 4 percentage points for likely voters.

“I don’t think it is a clear win for Democrats,” said Matt Mackowiak, who advises Republican candidates, speaking of healthcare as an election issue. “It’s tough to pin the entire blame on Republicans when they’ve been in control for a year and a half.”

Still, Democrats are betting the threat of losing healthcare coverage will motivate young and minority voters who often do not vote in non-presidential elections.

They are focusing on people like Shane Kehoe, 26, of Livingston, Montana, who plans to vote next month for the first time because he wants Democratic U.S. Senator Jon Tester to fend off a challenge to his seat.

"INDIANAPOLIS, Indiana (Reuters) - The commercial opens with an appeal to fear: a hoodie-wearing man prowling an alley, knife in hand. His face remains hidden but the ad makes it clear: He’s an illegal immigrant.

“We need tough immigration enforcement to keep dangerous criminals out,” says the ad by a national conservative political group, part of an effort to help a Republican challenger, Mike Braun, oust a Democratic incumbent in Indiana and capture a U.S. Senate seat in November’s congressional elections.

As they try to hang on to control of Congress, Republican candidates are following the lead of President Donald Trump and turning to rhetoric about immigrants as a tactic to motivate voters. The scope of that strategy emerges in a nationwide Reuters examination of ad buys, candidates’ social media posts and polling, as well as dozens of interviews with candidates, voters and campaign strategists.

The trend is especially visible on Twitter. Congressional Republicans seeking re-election have dramatically increased the number of tweets they post about immigration since Trump’s election, a Reuters/Ipsos analysis of social media shows. Immigration messaging has surged across the spectrum of Republican-held districts – highly competitive swing seats and reliably Republican ones, in places with immigrant populations both large and small.

The shift also shows up in the campaign ad wars. In races from Florida to California, in border states and ones with few immigrants, Republicans have poured millions of dollars into advertising that depict illegal immigrants as criminals and vowed enthusiastic support for Trump’s proposed wall at the Mexican border, the Reuters review shows.

This year, 20 percent of pro-Republican ads in congressional races have cited immigration, according to an analysis of broadcast advertising data through Oct. 15. That’s up from 8 percent in the same period of the 2014 congressional elections and 5 percent in the 2010 races. The analysis was conducted for Reuters by Kantar Media/CMAG, which tracks political ads.

Spending on Republican ads that mention immigration has more than doubled to $62.4 million this year from the 2014 elections and has quadrupled since the 2010 races, the Kantar Media/CMAG data shows. Immigration ad spending has also surged in state-level races. (Kantar Media/CMAG estimated earlier this month that total political ad spending for broadcast television would rise to $2.7 billion this year from $2.1 billion in 2014.)

In February, as Braun vied for the party’s nomination for the Indiana Senate seat, he ran a commercial highlighting a deadly highway crash involving a drunk driver who was in the country illegally. “There are lives at stake,” Braun said in the ad. In an interview with Reuters, he said he was not trying to demonize immigrants but was “making a point that border security is important.”

In Indiana, only about 5 percent of the state’s residents are immigrants, compared with 13.6 percent in the United States as a whole. But in the last two months, nearly a third of television ads sponsored or partially sponsored by Braun have mentioned immigration, said Michael Franz, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, a nonpartisan group tracking televised political advertising. Trump won Indiana by nearly 20 points in the 2016 election.

The attack ad featuring the knife-wielding immigrant was produced by One Nation, a political nonprofit. Spokesman Chris Pack said in a statement that the group works independently of campaigns and “strongly supports the efforts of the President and congressional leadership to reform our broken immigration system.”

A number of Republican ads link illegal immigrants to crime, but statistics paint a more nuanced picture. While people in the United States illegally have in some instances committed high-profile crimes, multiple studies – including ones from conservative groups like the Cato Institute - have found that immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than native-born Americans.

National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Matt Gorman declined to comment on the overall Republican messaging on immigration, but he did say he sees benefits in opposing so-called sanctuary cities, largely Democratic-run metropolises which offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants. Dozens of localities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, have joined the growing “sanctuary” movement.

“The issue of sanctuary cities is an issue we have used in several ads this cycle. It’s a potent issue,” he said. “It’s a commonsense thing that many folks are against.”

Trump won the White House on a promise to crack down on illegal immigrants. He has tried to end a program that gave protection for illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. He has ordered more aggressive enforcement and longer detention. One policy, to separate children from their parents at the southern border, set off an uproar and the president ended the policy in June.

""The issue of sanctuary cities is an issue we have used in several ads this cycle. It’s a potent issue. It’s a commonsense thing that many folks are against.""

Trump’s administration has also limited legal immigration, imposing more restrictions on work visas and sharply cutting the number of refugees allowed into the United States.

A thousands-strong group of immigrants now heading north toward the United States from Central America has inflamed the debate over illegal immigration just days before Americans head to the polls. The caravan has riled up Trump, who is intensifying his efforts to frame the Nov. 6 elections around the threat he says illegal immigrants pose to Americans’ safety.

Trump’s nationalist tone echoes sentiments rising in parts of Europe since the arrival in 2015 of more than a million people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and beyond. Hungary built a border fence along its southern border with Serbia, and anti-immigration politics have roiled Germany’s parliament.

A DRAMATIC EVOLUTION

The anti-immigration rhetoric, advertisements and campaign events, combined with the party’s embrace of Trump’s immigration crackdown, represent a dramatic evolution of Republicanism under Trump. Anti-immigration themes now dominate a party that for decades was defined by fiscal, social and national security conservatism.

As recently as 2013, when the Senate passed an immigration bill with bipartisan support, a significant portion of the Republican Party backed immigration reform – including a path to citizenship for some of the 12 million people living in the United States illegally. But those voices have been mostly silenced since the rise of Trump, drowned out by his statements decrying “amnesty for illegals” and “chain migration,” his term for the longstanding U.S. policy that allows legal immigrants to bring family members into the country.

Immigration is now seen as the top issue for likely Republican voters, especially among those who are older and without a college degree, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows. Twenty-three percent of Republicans said this month immigration was the “most important problem” facing the country, up from 4 percent in January 2012. By contrast, Democrats are far more focused on healthcare, the polls show.

“Immigration is literally number one - with a bullet - in every survey we do,” said Brandon Moody, a Republican consultant at Axiom Strategies working in the Montana Senate race. Moody says the issue also serves as a kind of shorthand, signaling loyalty to Trump’s agenda.

“GREATEST THREATS”

The Reuters/Ipsos analysis of Twitter data shows that the number of Republican lawmakers tweeting about immigration has risen sharply since Trump’s election. Reuters and Ipsos searched for immigration-related terms in tweets by Republican federal lawmakers who are seeking re-election in November and have actively tweeted since 2016.

Across 156 official Twitter accounts of Republican lawmakers and tens of thousands of tweets, the analysis identified 1,409 posts in the first nine months of 2018 which included immigration-related terms and phrases such as “immigrant,” “build the wall” or “border.” That’s a nearly 80 percent increase from 795 posts in the same months of 2017 and more than triple the number from the same period in 2016.

Reuters reviewed every tweet, weeding out those unrelated to immigration or which were entirely critical of Trump and his policies. The messages varied widely, from statements supporting Trump’s policies to nuanced calls to build a border wall while also reuniting families separated by border authorities.

The tweets ranged in tone. Some linked immigrants to threats of violence against Americans, like Texas Representative Randy Weber’s Jan. 30 tweet: “President says fix the border so gangs can’t get in & Americans won’t be murdered.”

Weber’s office declined to comment on the tweet.

Others praised Trump’s get-tough stance. “Illegal incursions way down, rule of law restored,” wrote Rod Blum, a Republican in Iowa facing a difficult re-election. He tweeted about immigration at least 14 times between January and September. Reuters did not find any tweets by Blum on the subject in 2016 and only a handful in 2017. Blum did not respond to requests for comment.

Reuters/Ipsos polling indicates that Republican lawmakers are largely preaching to the converted: 77 percent of Republican likely voters in a Sept. 8-17 survey said they supported policies to deport more illegal immigrants. An equal number backed building a wall on the southern border.

Across the 156 Republican Twitter accounts, Reuters identified only 37 tweets between 2016 and 2018 unambiguously critical of Trump’s immigration policies - almost all criticizing the separation of families at the border. The critical tweets came from 20 lawmakers who had also posted other tweets supporting strengthening border security or cracking down on illegal immigration.

Some conservatives, while backing stringent curbs on immigration, say the harsh tone has potentially far-reaching consequences – adding to political polarization, spawning harsher enforcement and potentially limiting the party’s appeal to America’s growing minority population.

“Trump has remade the Republican Party into a blood and soil national political party that is hostile to immigration,” said Steve Schmidt, a former Republican political consultant. He left the party in June in part because of the policy of separating mothers and children at the southern border. Schmidt said the country’s growing Hispanic population ultimately will render the immigration issue “a death knell for the Republican Party.”

White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement that Trump supports an immigration system based on the merit of the applicants, which “has nothing to do with race.”

“Trump has remade the Republican Party into a blood and soil national political party that is hostile to immigration.""

CONFLICTED HISTORY

While Trump has thrust immigration to the center of the party’s identity, the roots of this transformation began years ago. In Indiana, the state’s Republicans have made a journey that mirrors that of the national party.

In 2006, Republican legislators pushed a plan in the state legislature that would deny public health services to immigrants who had entered the country illegally. Mike Murphy, a Republican representative from Indianapolis, rose to speak in the glass-domed statehouse.

Murphy had long worked to bring more Latinos into the party. Since many of the bill’s backers were conservative Christians, Murphy quoted verses from the gospel of Matthew about charity to outcasts and strangers. “I just turned it against them – how do you guys profess to be Christians?” Murphy said. The bill was defeated overwhelmingly.

That year, Mike Pence, a U.S. congressman from Indiana at the time, was considered a rising conservative star. He waded in with a plan to allow illegal immigrants a path to achieve legal status – though he said they would have to leave the country first. Pence pitched his plan in moral terms, calling immigration reform “a test of the character of the conservative movement.”

Pence was pilloried by hardliners, who labeled the plan a “stealth amnesty.” The bill went nowhere.

As the far-right Tea Party movement rose in the Republican Party in 2010, resentment toward immigration increased throughout the state. When a new immigration-related bill came before Indiana lawmakers in 2011, they passed it, granting police the authority to detain people suspected of being illegal immigrants. A federal judge later threw out much of the law.

“SCARY TO THINK ABOUT”

In 2015, Pence, then Indiana’s governor, signed an order that aimed to block Syrian refugees from coming to Indiana, a harbinger of Trump’s later ban on immigration from mostly Muslim countries. Pence, now Trump’s vice president, saw his order overturned by a federal appeals judge.

Pence’s spokeswoman, Alyssa Farah, said Pence has “always been for a strong, secure, enforced border and upholding the rule of law,” and that Indiana’s move to reject Syrian refugees was “fundamentally different” from the issue of illegal immigration in the southern border. “Conflating the issue of illegal immigration from our southern border with whether or not a state accepts refugees from Syria is comparing apples and oranges,” she said.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump returned frequently to Indiana. At nearly every rally, he hit hard at illegal immigration, reprising crimes committed by people in the country illegally. “Raped, sodomized and killed,” he said at a rally in South Bend on May 2, 2016. “This is all over the country. We’re not taking it any more.”

Trump’s runaway win in Indiana’s presidential nominating contest a day later sealed his conquest of a crowded Republican field. Since the rise of Trump, Murphy said, it has become nearly impossible to have a civil debate about immigration. “Donald Trump made it ok to hate,” said Murphy, who is still a Republican but no longer in the state legislature.

The White House declined to comment on Murphy’s comments.

In sparsely populated Montana, almost 90 percent of the population is white and illegal immigrants are estimated to number only in the few thousands. Voter Sandy Shumaker says she was ignorant about how illegal immigration was affecting the country before listening to Trump.

Wearing an American flag hat with the slogan “Keep America Great,” the 70-year-old retired nurse said immigration is now one of her top concerns. She did not single out any specific campaign ad as a source of her thinking. Yet she echoed concerns about illegal immigrants voting for Democrats, as Trump has claimed without proof, and that Americans are being taken advantage of.

She was the first person in line for a campaign rally last month headlined by Donald Trump Jr., waiting hours to hear him stump for Matt Rosendale, the Republican challenging Democratic Senator Jon Tester.

“Open borders are scary,” Shumaker said. “Who knows what else is getting in? Drugs, I could imagine. I don’t know, Middle Eastern people that do not have our best interests at heart? It’s just scary to think about it.”", Special Report: How Republicans are using immigration to scare voters to the polls ,10-2018

“Necesitamos una vigilancia estricta de la inmigración para mantener alejados a delincuentes peligrosos”, dice el anuncio de un grupo político conservador, parte de un esfuerzo por ayudar a al candidato republicano Mike Braun a desbancar a un senador demócrata en Indiana y capturar un escaño en las elecciones legislativas de noviembre.

En su intento por mantener el control del Congreso, los candidatos republicanos siguen el ejemplo del presidente Donald Trump y usan la retórica contra los inmigrantes como una táctica para motivar a los votantes.

El alcance del método surge de un examen de Reuters de las compras de anuncios, publicaciones de candidatos en redes sociales, así como docenas de entrevistas con postulantes, votantes y estrategas de campaña.

La tendencia es especialmente clara en Twitter. Los legisladores republicanos que buscan la reelección han aumentado dramáticamente la cantidad de tuits que publican sobre la inmigración desde la elección de Trump, según un análisis de Reuters/Ipsos a redes sociales.(tmsnrt.rs/2EIPef5)

Los mensajes sobre inmigración se han extendido en todo el espectro de distritos controlados por los republicanos: donde se disputan escaños en carreras muy peleadas y en los que parecen victorias seguras, en lugares con grandes poblaciones de inmigrantes y en los que hay pocos.

El cambio también se percibe en las campañas publicitarias. Según la revisión de Reuters, en elecciones desde Florida hasta California, en los estados fronterizos y en los que tienen pocos migrantes, los republicanos han invertido millones de dólares en avisos que pintan a los inmigrantes ilegales como criminales y prometen un apoyo entusiasta a un muro fronterizo con México.

Este año, un 20 por ciento de los anuncios a favor del Partido Republicano en las elecciones para el Congreso han mencionado la inmigración, según un análisis de las publicidades emitidas hasta el 15 de octubre. El total representa un aumento frente al 8 por ciento del mismo período en las legislativas de 2014 y al 5 por ciento de las de 2010. El análisis fue realizado para Reuters por Kantar Media/CMAG.

El gasto en anuncios republicanos que mencionan la inmigración se ha más que duplicado a 62,4 millones de dólares este año frente a los comicios de 2014, y se ha cuadruplicado en la comparación con la campaña de 2010, según los datos de Kantar Media/CMAG.

En febrero, cuando Braun competía por la nominación del partido para el escaño en el Senado por Indiana usó una publicidad en la que se mostraba un accidente de tráfico mortal que involucraba a un conductor ebrio que estaba en el país ilegalmente. “Hay vidas en juego”, dijo Braun en el anuncio.

En una entrevista con Reuters, el político aseguró que no estaba tratando de demonizar a los inmigrantes, sino que “señalaba que la seguridad de la frontera es importante”.

En Indiana, solo el 5 por ciento de los residentes del estado son inmigrantes, frente al 13,6 por ciento en todo Estados Unidos.

Sin embargo, en los últimos dos meses, casi un tercio de los anuncios de televisión patrocinados o parcialmente patrocinados por Braun han mencionado la inmigración, dijo Michael Franz, un director de Wesleyan Media Project, un grupo no partidista que monitoriza la publicidad política televisada.

Trump ganó Indiana por casi 20 puntos porcentuales de diferencia en las elecciones de 2016.

El anuncio del ataque que presenta al inmigrante con un cuchillo fue producido por One Nation, una organización política sin fines de lucro. El portavoz Chris Pack dijo que el grupo trabaja independientemente de las campañas y “apoya firmemente los esfuerzos del presidente y líderes del Congreso para reformar nuestro fallido sistema de inmigración”.

Varios anuncios republicanos vinculan a los inmigrantes ilegales con el crimen, pero las estadísticas muestran una realidad con más matices. Si bien han cometido en algunos casos delitos muy vistosos, varios estudios, incluidos de grupos conservadores como el Instituto Cato, han encontrado que la tasa de delitos de los inmigrantes es más baja que la de los nacidos estadounidenses.

El portavoz del Comité del Congreso Nacional Republicano, Matt Gorman, se negó a comentar acerca del mensaje general sobre inmigración, pero dijo que ve beneficios en oponerse a las llamadas ciudades santuario, en su mayoría metrópolis gobernadas por demócratas que ofrecen refugio a inmigrantes ilegales.

“El tema de las ciudades santuario es un tema que hemos usado en varios anuncios de este ciclo. Es un tema potente”, dijo. “Es una cosa de sentido común con la que mucha gente está en contra”.

Trump ganó la Casa Blanca con la promesa de acabar con los inmigrantes ilegales. Ha intentado terminar con un programa que protegía a los inmigrantes ilegales traídos a Estados Unidos de niños, ordenó una fiscalización más agresiva y detenciones más largas. Una iniciativa para separar a niños de sus padres en la frontera sur provocó un alboroto y tuvo que retirarla en junio.

El gobierno de Trump también ha limitado la inmigración legal, puso más restricciones a las visas de trabajo y ha recortado drásticamente el número de refugiados que acepta.

Un grupo de miles de migrantes que se dirige hacia Estados Unidos desde Centroamérica reavivó el debate sobre la inmigración ilegal a días de que los estadounidenses acudan a las urnas. La caravana enfureció a Trump, que está redoblando esfuerzos para centrar las elecciones del 6 de noviembre en la amenaza que, según él, representan los inmigrantes ilegales para la seguridad.

El tono nacionalista de Trump se hace eco de una creciente animosidad en algunas partes de Europa desde la llegada en 2015 de más de un millón de personas que huían de la guerra y la pobreza en Oriente Medio, África y otros lugares.

Hungría construyó una valla en su frontera con Serbia, y los políticos que se oponen a la inmigración han sacudido al Parlamento de Alemania.

EVOLUCIÓN DRAMÁTICA

La retórica contra la inmigración, los anuncios y los eventos de campaña, sumados a la aceptación en el partido de los planteamientos de Trump, representa una dramática evolución de los republicanos. Los temas contra la inmigración ahora dominan un partido que durante décadas se definió por sus posiciones conservadoras en lo fiscal, social y de seguridad nacional.

En 2013, cuando el Senado aprobó un proyecto de ley de inmigración con apoyo bipartidista, una parte significativa de la reforma fue respaldada por el Partido Republicano, lo que incluía un vía para la ciudadanía para algunas de las 12 millones de personas que viven en Estados Unidos ilegalmente.

Sin embargo, esas voces han sido mayormente silenciadas desde el surgimiento de Trump y sus declaraciones que denuncian una “amnistía para ilegales” y “migración en cadena” para referirse a una política tradicional de Estados Unidos que permite a los inmigrantes legales traer a familiares al país.

La inmigración ahora es percibida por los probables votantes republicanos como el principal problema, especialmente entre aquellos que son mayores y no tienen un título universitario, según los sondeos de Reuters/Ipsos.

El 23 por ciento de los republicanos dijo este mes que la inmigración era el “problema más importante” que enfrenta el país, un aumento frente al 4 por ciento en enero de 2012. Por el contrario, los demócratas están mucho más centrados en la atención médica, según las encuestas.

“La inmigración es literalmente la número uno, y subrayada, en cada encuesta que hacemos”, dijo Brandon Moody, consultor republicano en Axiom Strategies que trabaja en la carrera por el Senado de Montana. Moody dice que el tema también sirve como una especie de guiño que demuestra lealtad al programa de Trump.

“LA MAYOR DE LAS AMENAZAS”

El análisis de Reuters/Ipsos muestra que el número de legisladores republicanos que tuitean sobre inmigración ha subido considerablemente desde la llegada de Trump.

Reuters e Ipsos buscaron términos relacionados con la inmigración en tuits de legisladores republicanos que buscan la reelección en noviembre y han publicado activamente desde 2016.

En las 156 cuentas oficiales de Twitter de legisladores republicanos y decenas de miles de tuits, el análisis identificó 1.409 publicaciones en los primeros nueve meses de 2018 que incluían términos y frases relacionadas con la inmigración como “inmigrante”, “construir el muro” o “frontera”. El aumento fue de casi el 80 por ciento respecto de los mismos meses de 2017 y más del triple que en el mismo período de 2016.

Reuters revisó cada tuit, eliminando aquellos que no estaban relacionados con la inmigración o que eran totalmente críticos con Trump y sus políticas. Los mensajes variaron ampliamente, desde declaraciones que apoyaban las políticas de Trump hasta llamados a construir un muro fronterizo y al mismo tiempo reunir a familias separadas por autoridades fronterizas.

Los tuits variaban en tono. Algunos vinculaban a los inmigrantes con hechos de violencia contra los estadounidenses, como el tuit del representante de Texas Randy Weber el 30 de enero: “El presidente dice que arreglemos la frontera para que las pandillas no puedan entrar y que los estadounidenses no sean asesinados”.

El despacho de Weber no quiso hacer comentarios sobre el tuit.

Otros elogiaban la postura dura de Trump. “Las incursiones ilegales bajaron y se restableció el imperio de la ley”, escribió Rod Blum, un republicano en Iowa que enfrenta una difícil reelección. Tuiteó sobre inmigración al menos 14 veces entre enero y septiembre, y no respondió a pedidos de comentarios.

Los sondeos de Reuters/Ipsos indican que los legisladores republicanos están, en gran medida, predicando a los conversos: el 77 por ciento de los posibles votantes republicanos en una encuesta del 8 al 17 de septiembre dijeron que apoyaban las políticas para deportar a más inmigrantes ilegales. Un número similar respaldó la construcción de un muro en la frontera sur.

“Trump ha transformado al Partido Republicano en un partido político nacional de sangre y territorio, que es hostil a la inmigración”, dijo Steve Schmidt, un exconsultor político republicano.

Schmidt abandonó el partido en junio, en parte debido a la política de separar a madres de niños en la frontera sur. Según él, la creciente población hispana en el país finalmente hará que el tema de la inmigración sea “una sentencia de muerte para el Partido Republicano”.

El portavoz de la Casa Blanca, Hogan Gidley, dijo en un comunicado que Trump apoya un sistema de inmigración que se base en el mérito de los solicitantes y que “no tiene nada que ver con la raza”.

HISTORIA DE CONFLICTO

Si bien Trump ha llevado la inmigración al corazón de la identidad partidaria, las raíces de esta transformación comenzaron hace años. En Indiana, los republicanos del estado han hecho un viaje que refleja el del partido nacional.

En 2006, los legisladores republicanos impulsaron un plan en la legislatura estatal que negaría los servicios de salud pública a los inmigrantes que habían ingresado ilegalmente al país. Mike Murphy, un representante republicano de Indianápolis, se levantó para hablar en la legislatura local.

Murphy había trabajado durante mucho tiempo para traer más latinos al partido. Como muchos de los que estaban a favor del proyecto de ley eran cristianos conservadores, Murphy citó los versos del evangelio de Mateo sobre la caridad a los marginados y extraños.

“Simplemente lo volví en contra de ellos. ¿Cómo afirman ustedes que son cristianos?”, dijo Murphy.

El proyecto de ley fue derrotado abrumadoramente.

Ese año, Mike Pence, entonces un congresista estadounidense de Indiana, era considerado una estrella conservadora en ascenso. Se involucró con un plan para abrirles a inmigrantes ilegales un camino a fin de alcanzar un estatus legal, aunque dijo que primero tendrían que abandonar el país.

Pence lanzó su plan en términos morales, llamando a la reforma migratoria “una prueba del carácter del movimiento conservador”. Fue criticado por los de línea dura, que calificaron el plan de una “amnistía furtiva”.

El proyecto de ley no llegó a ninguna parte.

Mientras el movimiento Tea Party de extrema derecha nacía en el Partido Republicano en 2010, el resentimiento hacia la inmigración aumentó en todo el estado. Cuando un nuevo proyecto de ley relacionado con la inmigración llegó a los legisladores de Indiana en 2011, lo aprobaron, otorgando a la policía la autoridad para detener a personas sospechosas de ser inmigrantes ilegales. Un juez federal desechó gran parte de la ley.

“DA MIEDO DE SOLO PENSARLO”

En 2015, Pence, el entonces gobernador de Indiana, firmó una orden que pretendía impedir que refugiados sirios llegaran a Indiana, un presagio de la posterior prohibición de Trump a la inmigración de países mayoritariamente musulmanes. Pence, ahora vicepresidente de Trump, vio su orden revocada por un juez federal de apelaciones.

La portavoz de Pence, Alyssa Farah, dijo que Pence “siempre ha estado a favor de una frontera fuerte, segura, manteniendo el estado de derecho”, y que la decisión de Indiana de rechazar a los refugiados sirios era “fundamentalmente diferente” del tema de la inmigración ilegal en el sur.

“Combinar el tema de la inmigración ilegal en nuestra frontera sur con si un estado acepta o no a los refugiados de Siria es comparar manzanas y naranjas”, dijo.

Durante la campaña presidencial de 2016, Trump regresó con frecuencia a Indiana. En casi todos los actos proselitistas, golpeó duramente contra la inmigración ilegal, repitiendo que los delitos son cometidos por personas en el país ilegalmente. “Violado, sodomizado y asesinado”, dijo en un mitin en South Bend el 2 de mayo de 2016. “Esto es así por todo el país. No lo vamos a tolerar más”.

La victoria contundente de Trump en Indiana para la nominación presidencial un día después selló su conquista de un campo republicano abarrotado. Desde el ascenso de Trump, dijo Murphy, se ha vuelto casi imposible tener un debate civil sobre la inmigración.

“Donald Trump hizo que estuviera bien odiar”, dijo Murphy, quien aún es republicana pero ya no está en la legislatura estatal. La Casa Blanca se negó a comentar sobre los dichos de Murphy.

En la escasamente poblada Montana, casi el 90 por ciento de la población es blanca y se estima que los inmigrantes ilegales son solo unos pocos miles. La votante Sandy Shumaker dice que desconocía cómo la inmigración ilegal estaba afectando al país antes de escuchar a Trump.

La enfermera jubilada de 70 años dijo que la inmigración es ahora una de sus principales inquietudes. Aunque no recordó ningún anuncio de campaña específico que haya despertado ese sentimiento, se hizo eco de las preocupaciones sobre los inmigrantes ilegales que votaron por los demócratas, como Trump ha afirmado sin pruebas, y que se están aprovechando de los estadounidenses.

Shumaker fue la primera persona en la fila para entrar en un mitin de campaña el mes pasado encabezado por Donald Trump Jr., esperando horas para escucharlo hacer campaña por Matt Rosendale, el republicano que desafía al senador demócrata Jon Tester.

“Las fronteras abiertas dan miedo”, dijo Shumaker. “¿Quién sabe qué más está entrando? Drogas, me podría imaginar. No sé, ¿personas del Medio Oriente que no comparten genuinamente nuestros mejores intereses? Da miedo de solo pensarlo”.

El portavoz del Comité del Congreso Nacional Republicano, Matt Gorman, se negó a comentar acerca del mensaje general sobre inmigración, pero dijo que ve beneficios en oponerse a las llamadas ciudades santuario, en su mayoría metrópolis gobernadas por demócratas que ofrecen refugio a inmigrantes ilegales.

“El tema de las ciudades santuario es un tema que hemos usado en varios anuncios de este ciclo. Es un tema potente”, dijo. “Es una cosa de sentido común con la que mucha gente está en contra”.

Trump ganó la Casa Blanca con la promesa de acabar con los inmigrantes ilegales. Ha intentado terminar con un programa que protegía a los inmigrantes ilegales traídos a Estados Unidos de niños, ordenó una fiscalización más agresiva y detenciones más largas. Una iniciativa para separar a niños de sus padres en la frontera sur provocó un alboroto y tuvo que retirarla en junio.

El gobierno de Trump también ha limitado la inmigración legal, puso más restricciones a las visas de trabajo y ha recortado drásticamente el número de refugiados que acepta.

Un grupo de miles de migrantes que se dirige hacia Estados Unidos desde Centroamérica reavivó el debate sobre la inmigración ilegal a días de que los estadounidenses acudan a las urnas. La caravana enfureció a Trump, que está redoblando esfuerzos para centrar las elecciones del 6 de noviembre en la amenaza que, según él, representan los inmigrantes ilegales para la seguridad.

El tono nacionalista de Trump se hace eco de una creciente animosidad en algunas partes de Europa desde la llegada en 2015 de más de un millón de personas que huían de la guerra y la pobreza en Oriente Medio, África y otros lugares.

Hungría construyó una valla en su frontera con Serbia, y los políticos que se oponen a la inmigración han sacudido al Parlamento de Alemania.

EVOLUCIÓN DRAMÁTICA

La retórica contra la inmigración, los anuncios y los eventos de campaña, sumados a la aceptación en el partido de los planteamientos de Trump, representa una dramática evolución de los republicanos. Los temas contra la inmigración ahora dominan un partido que durante décadas se definió por sus posiciones conservadoras en lo fiscal, social y de seguridad nacional.

En 2013, cuando el Senado aprobó un proyecto de ley de inmigración con apoyo bipartidista, una parte significativa de la reforma fue respaldada por el Partido Republicano, lo que incluía un vía para la ciudadanía para algunas de las 12 millones de personas que viven en Estados Unidos ilegalmente.

Sin embargo, esas voces han sido mayormente silenciadas desde el surgimiento de Trump y sus declaraciones que denuncian una “amnistía para ilegales” y “migración en cadena” para referirse a una política tradicional de Estados Unidos que permite a los inmigrantes legales traer a familiares al país.

La inmigración ahora es percibida por los probables votantes republicanos como el principal problema, especialmente entre aquellos que son mayores y no tienen un título universitario, según los sondeos de Reuters/Ipsos.

El 23 por ciento de los republicanos dijo este mes que la inmigración era el “problema más importante” que enfrenta el país, un aumento frente al 4 por ciento en enero de 2012. Por el contrario, los demócratas están mucho más centrados en la atención médica, según las encuestas.

“La inmigración es literalmente la número uno, y subrayada, en cada encuesta que hacemos”, dijo Brandon Moody, consultor republicano en Axiom Strategies que trabaja en la carrera por el Senado de Montana. Moody dice que el tema también sirve como una especie de guiño que demuestra lealtad al programa de Trump.

“LA MAYOR DE LAS AMENAZAS”

El análisis de Reuters/Ipsos muestra que el número de legisladores republicanos que tuitean sobre inmigración ha subido considerablemente desde la llegada de Trump.

Reuters e Ipsos buscaron términos relacionados con la inmigración en tuits de legisladores republicanos que buscan la reelección en noviembre y han publicado activamente desde 2016.

En las 156 cuentas oficiales de Twitter de legisladores republicanos y decenas de miles de tuits, el análisis identificó 1.409 publicaciones en los primeros nueve meses de 2018 que incluían términos y frases relacionadas con la inmigración como “inmigrante”, “construir el muro” o “frontera”. El aumento fue de casi el 80 por ciento respecto de los mismos meses de 2017 y más del triple que en el mismo período de 2016.

Reuters revisó cada tuit, eliminando aquellos que no estaban relacionados con la inmigración o que eran totalmente críticos con Trump y sus políticas. Los mensajes variaron ampliamente, desde declaraciones que apoyaban las políticas de Trump hasta llamados a construir un muro fronterizo y al mismo tiempo reunir a familias separadas por autoridades fronterizas.

Los tuits variaban en tono. Algunos vinculaban a los inmigrantes con hechos de violencia contra los estadounidenses, como el tuit del representante de Texas Randy Weber el 30 de enero: “El presidente dice que arreglemos la frontera para que las pandillas no puedan entrar y que los estadounidenses no sean asesinados”.

El despacho de Weber no quiso hacer comentarios sobre el tuit.

Otros elogiaban la postura dura de Trump. “Las incursiones ilegales bajaron y se restableció el imperio de la ley”, escribió Rod Blum, un republicano en Iowa que enfrenta una difícil reelección. Tuiteó sobre inmigración al menos 14 veces entre enero y septiembre, y no respondió a pedidos de comentarios.

Los sondeos de Reuters/Ipsos indican que los legisladores republicanos están, en gran medida, predicando a los conversos: el 77 por ciento de los posibles votantes republicanos en una encuesta del 8 al 17 de septiembre dijeron que apoyaban las políticas para deportar a más inmigrantes ilegales. Un número similar respaldó la construcción de un muro en la frontera sur.

“Trump ha transformado al Partido Republicano en un partido político nacional de sangre y territorio, que es hostil a la inmigración”, dijo Steve Schmidt, un exconsultor político republicano.

Schmidt abandonó el partido en junio, en parte debido a la política de separar a madres de niños en la frontera sur. Según él, la creciente población hispana en el país finalmente hará que el tema de la inmigración sea “una sentencia de muerte para el Partido Republicano”.

El portavoz de la Casa Blanca, Hogan Gidley, dijo en un comunicado que Trump apoya un sistema de inmigración que se base en el mérito de los solicitantes y que “no tiene nada que ver con la raza”.

HISTORIA DE CONFLICTO

Si bien Trump ha llevado la inmigración al corazón de la identidad partidaria, las raíces de esta transformación comenzaron hace años. En Indiana, los republicanos del estado han hecho un viaje que refleja el del partido nacional.

En 2006, los legisladores republicanos impulsaron un plan en la legislatura estatal que negaría los servicios de salud pública a los inmigrantes que habían ingresado ilegalmente al país. Mike Murphy, un representante republicano de Indianápolis, se levantó para hablar en la legislatura local.

Murphy había trabajado durante mucho tiempo para traer más latinos al partido. Como muchos de los que estaban a favor del proyecto de ley eran cristianos conservadores, Murphy citó los versos del evangelio de Mateo sobre la caridad a los marginados y extraños.

“Simplemente lo volví en contra de ellos. ¿Cómo afirman ustedes que son cristianos?”, dijo Murphy.

El proyecto de ley fue derrotado abrumadoramente.

Ese año, Mike Pence, entonces un congresista estadounidense de Indiana, era considerado una estrella conservadora en ascenso. Se involucró con un plan para abrirles a inmigrantes ilegales un camino a fin de alcanzar un estatus legal, aunque dijo que primero tendrían que abandonar el país.

Pence lanzó su plan en términos morales, llamando a la reforma migratoria “una prueba del carácter del movimiento conservador”. Fue criticado por los de línea dura, que calificaron el plan de una “amnistía furtiva”.

El proyecto de ley no llegó a ninguna parte.

Mientras el movimiento Tea Party de extrema derecha nacía en el Partido Republicano en 2010, el resentimiento hacia la inmigración aumentó en todo el estado. Cuando un nuevo proyecto de ley relacionado con la inmigración llegó a los legisladores de Indiana en 2011, lo aprobaron, otorgando a la policía la autoridad para detener a personas sospechosas de ser inmigrantes ilegales. Un juez federal desechó gran parte de la ley.

“DA MIEDO DE SOLO PENSARLO”

En 2015, Pence, el entonces gobernador de Indiana, firmó una orden que pretendía impedir que refugiados sirios llegaran a Indiana, un presagio de la posterior prohibición de Trump a la inmigración de países mayoritariamente musulmanes. Pence, ahora vicepresidente de Trump, vio su orden revocada por un juez federal de apelaciones.

La portavoz de Pence, Alyssa Farah, dijo que Pence “siempre ha estado a favor de una frontera fuerte, segura, manteniendo el estado de derecho”, y que la decisión de Indiana de rechazar a los refugiados sirios era “fundamentalmente diferente” del tema de la inmigración ilegal en el sur.

“Combinar el tema de la inmigración ilegal en nuestra frontera sur con si un estado acepta o no a los refugiados de Siria es comparar manzanas y naranjas”, dijo.

Durante la campaña presidencial de 2016, Trump regresó con frecuencia a Indiana. En casi todos los actos proselitistas, golpeó duramente contra la inmigración ilegal, repitiendo que los delitos son cometidos por personas en el país ilegalmente. “Violado, sodomizado y asesinado”, dijo en un mitin en South Bend el 2 de mayo de 2016. “Esto es así por todo el país. No lo vamos a tolerar más”.

La victoria contundente de Trump en Indiana para la nominación presidencial un día después selló su conquista de un campo republicano abarrotado. Desde el ascenso de Trump, dijo Murphy, se ha vuelto casi imposible tener un debate civil sobre la inmigración.

“Donald Trump hizo que estuviera bien odiar”, dijo Murphy, quien aún es republicana pero ya no está en la legislatura estatal. La Casa Blanca se negó a comentar sobre los dichos de Murphy.

En la escasamente poblada Montana, casi el 90 por ciento de la población es blanca y se estima que los inmigrantes ilegales son solo unos pocos miles. La votante Sandy Shumaker dice que desconocía cómo la inmigración ilegal estaba afectando al país antes de escuchar a Trump.

La enfermera jubilada de 70 años dijo que la inmigración es ahora una de sus principales inquietudes. Aunque no recordó ningún anuncio de campaña específico que haya despertado ese sentimiento, se hizo eco de las preocupaciones sobre los inmigrantes ilegales que votaron por los demócratas, como Trump ha afirmado sin pruebas, y que se están aprovechando de los estadounidenses.

Shumaker fue la primera persona en la fila para entrar en un mitin de campaña el mes pasado encabezado por Donald Trump Jr., esperando horas para escucharlo hacer campaña por Matt Rosendale, el republicano que desafía al senador demócrata Jon Tester.

“Las fronteras abiertas dan miedo”, dijo Shumaker. “¿Quién sabe qué más está entrando? Drogas, me podría imaginar. No sé, ¿personas del Medio Oriente que no comparten genuinamente nuestros mejores intereses? Da miedo de solo pensarlo”.

"BELGRADE, Mont. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump touted U.S. economic growth and his nationalist policies as he rallied with Republican candidates ahead of Tuesday’s U.S. congressional elections as Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden urged voters to reject division.

Control of both houses of the U.S. Congress, currently dominated by Republicans, and 36 governors’ offices will be at stake when Americans vote in Tuesday’s elections. Interest has been unusually high for a non-presidential election year, with early voting running well ahead of past cycles.

Opinion polls and nonpartisan forecasters generally show Democrats with a strong chance of taking the 23 additional seats they would need for a majority in the House of Representatives, which they could use to launch investigations into Trump’s administration and block his legislative agenda.

Republicans are favored to retain control of the Senate, whose powers include confirming Trump’s nominations to lifetime seats on the Supreme Court.

“America is booming. Republicans passed a massive tax cut for working families and we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle class,” Trump said, standing in a Belgrade, Montana, airfield with Air Force One as a backdrop.

Last December, Trump signed into law the largest tax overhaul since the 1980s, which slashed the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and temporarily reduced the tax burden for most individuals as well.

The appearance was intended to boost the campaign of Matt Rosendale, the Republican state auditor challenging Democratic U.S. Senator Jon Tester. Trump called out Tester for his vote against his most recent Supreme Court nominee, saying “what he did was terrible.”

Republicans in many competitive suburban districts have tried to focus their campaign messages on the robust economic growth, though in his campaign appearances Trump has also focused on his hard-line immigration stance as he looks to stem the illegal and legal flow of people into the United States.

Biden campaigned in Ohio on Saturday in support of Democrats U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown and gubernatorial candidate Richard Cordray.

“We’re in a battle for America’s soul,” Biden, his voice faint and scratchy, told a crowd at a high school south of Cleveland. “We Democrats have to make it clear who we are. We choose hope over fear, we choose unity over division, we choose our allies over our enemies and we choose truth over lies.”

Congressional candidates campaigned in a whirlwind close across the country: in Virginia, Democrat Jennifer Wexton greeted voters in the Manassas Veterans Day parade; in New Jersey Republican Jay Webber met them in a diner, and in Minnesota Republican Pete Stauber went door to door urging people to vote.

EARLY VOTING UP SHARPLY

As of Friday night, almost 32.4 million people had cast ballots early, according to The Election Project at the University of Florida, which tracks turnout. That is up more than 50 percent from the 20.5 million early votes cast in all of 2014, the last federal election when the White House was not at stake.

Trump on Friday appeared in West Virginia with Patrick Morrisey, who is seeking to unseat Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. They marked his third campaign appearance in West Virginia and fourth in Montana.

Some analysts said the president’s repeated visits to states that he won in 2016 were a signal Republicans were worried about keeping control of Congress.

“It’s not a good sign for Republicans if they have to spend all these resources for a seat they shouldn’t have to be fighting for,” said Simon Haeder, a professor of political science at West Virginia University, in a phone interview. “That should be a solid Republican seat.”

In Florida, Trump is due to campaign for Governor Rick Scott, who is trying to unseat Democratic U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, and U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis, who is running for governor against Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Candidatos ao Congresso do Estados Unidos entraram na reta final da campanha neste sábado, com o ex-vice-presidente democrata Joe Biden pedindo que os eleitores rejeitem a divisão, enquanto o presidente Donald Trump exaltou o crescimento econômico e fez alertas sobre imigração.

Estão em jogo nas eleições de terça-feira o controle das duas casas do Congresso, atualmente dominadas pelos republicanos, e 36 cargos de governador. O interesse tem sido maior do que o normal para um ano sem pleito presidencial, com votações antecipadas em um nível bem acima do visto nos últimos anos.

Pesquisas de opinião e analistas apartidários geralmente têm mostrado os democratas com uma forte chance de conseguir os 23 assentos adicionais de que necessitam para ter maioria na Câmara dos Representantes. Eles poderiam usar uma eventual maioria para lançar investigações contra a administração Trump e bloquear sua agenda legislativa.

Os republicanos são favoritos para manter o controle do Senado, cujos poderes incluem confirmar as nomeações de Trump para cargos vitalícios na Suprema Corte.

Trump deve fazer campanha com candidatos ao Senado em Montana e na Flórida, no quarto dia de uma turnê de 11 dias de comícios, com o foco principalmente em Estados onde ele venceu em 2016 e nos quais republicanos tentam desafiar democratas que buscam a reeleição.

“Indo para Montana e Flórida hoje! Todos muito animados com o número de empregos - 250 mil novos empregos em outubro. E também salários crescendo. Wow!”, escreveu Trump no Twitter neste sábado.

O Departamento de Trabalho divulgou na sexta-feira uma criação de empregos maior do que a esperada em outubro, com a taxa de desemprego estável em 3,7 por cento, menor nível em 49 anos, e salários chegando ao seu maior crescimento anual em quase uma década.

Republicanos em muitos distritos competitivos suburbanos têm tentado concentrar a mensagem de suas campanhas no robusto crescimento econômico, embora Trump, em suas aparições, também esteja focando nas suas medidas rígidas contra imigração, que visam limitar a entrada legal e ilegal de pessoas nos Estados Unidos.

Biden fez campanha em Ohio no sábado, em apoio ao senador Sherrod Brown, candidato à reeleição, e Richard Cordray, que tenta o governo do Estado.

“Estamos em uma batalha pela alma dos Estados Unidos”, disse Biden, com a voz fraca e áspera, para o público em uma escola ao sul de Cleveland. “Nós, democratas, temos que deixar claro quem somos. Escolhemos esperança em vez de medo, escolhemos união em vez de divisão, escolhemos nossos aliados em vez dos nossos inimigos e escolhemos a verdade ao invés das mentiras”.

Candidatos ao Congresso fizeram campanha ao redor do país: na Virginia, a democrata Jennifer Weston buscou votos na parada do Dia dos Veteranos, em Manassas; em Nova Jersey, o republicano Jay Webber encontrou eleitores em um jantar e, em Minnesota, o republicano Pete Stauber foi porta a porta pedindo votos.

MAIS VOTOS ANTECIPADOS

Até a noite de sexta-feira, quase 32,4 milhões de pessoas haviam votado antecipadamente, de acordo com o Projeto Eleitoral da Universidade da Flórida, que monitora o comparecimento dos eleitores. Isso representa crescimento acima de 50 por cento em relação ao total de 20,5 milhões de votos antecipados em 2014, a última eleição federal em que a Casa Branca não estava em jogo.

Trump apareceu em West Virginia na sexta-feira com Patrick Morrissey, que concorre contra o senador democrata Joe Manchin. Foi sua terceira aparição em campanha no Estado.

Republicans in many competitive suburban districts have tried to focus their campaign messages on the robust economic growth, though in his campaign appearances Trump has also focused on his hard-line immigration stance as he looks to stem the illegal and legal flow of people into the United States.

Biden campaigned in Ohio on Saturday in support of Democrats U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown and gubernatorial candidate Richard Cordray.

“We’re in a battle for America’s soul,” Biden, his voice faint and scratchy, told a crowd at a high school south of Cleveland. “We Democrats have to make it clear who we are. We choose hope over fear, we choose unity over division, we choose our allies over our enemies and we choose truth over lies.”

Congressional candidates campaigned in a whirlwind close across the country: in Virginia, Democrat Jennifer Wexton greeted voters in the Manassas Veterans Day parade; in New Jersey Republican Jay Webber met them in a diner, and in Minnesota Republican Pete Stauber went door to door urging people to vote.

EARLY VOTING UP SHARPLY

As of Friday night, almost 32.4 million people had cast ballots early, according to The Election Project at the University of Florida, which tracks turnout. That is up more than 50 percent from the 20.5 million early votes cast in all of 2014, the last federal election when the White House was not at stake.

Trump on Friday appeared in West Virginia with Patrick Morrisey, who is seeking to unseat Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. They marked his third campaign appearance in West Virginia and fourth in Montana.

Some analysts said the president’s repeated visits to states that he won in 2016 were a signal Republicans were worried about keeping control of Congress.

“It’s not a good sign for Republicans if they have to spend all these resources for a seat they shouldn’t have to be fighting for,” said Simon Haeder, a professor of political science at West Virginia University, in a phone interview. “That should be a solid Republican seat.”

In Florida, Trump is due to campaign for Governor Rick Scott, who is trying to unseat Democratic U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, and U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis, who is running for governor against Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum.

"(Reuters) - After two years of wielding no practical political power in Washington, the Democratic Party faces a strong chance of winning control of the U.S. House of Representatives in next week’s election, with Republicans likely to keep the Senate.

Taking a majority in even one of the chambers in the Nov. 6 elections would give Democrats a chance to more effectively oppose Republican President Donald Trump’s agenda, as well as potentially launch investigations into his administration.

Republicans hold a 23-seat majority in the 435-seat House, far wider than their two-seat majority in the 100-seat Senate, but are more vulnerable in the lower chamber where they are defending 41 seats without an incumbent on the ballot, the most since 1930.

In the Senate, which gives more voice to the rural voters who make up an important part of the Republican base, Democrats are defending 10 seats in states that Trump won in 2016, some by huge margins. That favors Republicans.

Several states have experienced unusually high levels of early voting, according to data from the University of Florida.

WHAT ARE THE PARTIES FOCUSED ON?

Democrats have focused their closing messaging on defending the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, and its protection of insurance coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.

Republicans have played up the Senate’s recent confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, Trump’s second nominee to a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, which cemented a 5-4 conservative majority. Trump has also focused attention on immigration issues, including a caravan of migrants from Central America headed through Mexico toward the U.S. border.

“They (Democrats) misread the electorate in many areas, especially when it comes to the Senate,” said Marc Lotter, a former top aide to Vice President Mike Pence. “You have seen a big shift toward Republicans in many states that the president carried.”

WHY DO REPUBLICANS HAVE AN SENATE EDGE?

Democrats, who last controlled the Senate in 2014, are spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to protect five critical seats where incumbents are particularly vulnerable this year. Losing just one of the seats in West Virginia, Indiana, North Dakota, Montana and Missouri - all won by Trump in 2016 - could doom any shot of taking the Senate.

Opinion polls show toss-up races in Indiana and Missouri. In Montana, which Trump carried by 20 percentage points, incumbent Democratic Senator Jon Tester leads recent polls by more than 4 points. In West Virginia, which Trump carried by over 40 percentage points, Democratic Senator Joe Manchin led by as much as 16 points in one recent poll.

But in North Dakota, Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp has fallen far behind challenger Republican U.S. Representative Kevin Cramer in recent polls.

Republicans have sought to play up calls by some Democrats to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, better known as ICE, and the angry crowds of protesters who swarmed the Capitol to object to the Supreme Court nomination of Kavanaugh, who was accused of a decades-old sexual assault.

While straining to hold all the states Trump won, Democrats are also focused on Florida, Arizona and Nevada, which strategists said would be crucial pickups for the party.

HOW MUCH MONEY HAS BEEN RAISED?

One measure of the intensity of interest in this campaign season is fundraising. This year’s congressional campaigns were on pace to break fundraising records for midterm elections, when Congress but not the White House is on the line, according to a Reuters analysis of campaign finance disclosures.

Democrats collectively out-fundraised Republicans. Senate Democrats raised at least $551 million, while Republicans raised at least $368 million. House Democratic candidates raised at least $680 million, while Republicans raised at least $540 million.

The total fundraising in each chamber topped what had been raised at the same point in the 2010 campaign cycle.

WHICH PARTY HAS THE ADVANTAGE IN HOUSE RACES?

In the House, Democrats are hoping they will overcome a disadvantage built into gerrymandered maps and capture seats designed to elect Republicans. Many of the seats in play are in suburban or urban districts that Trump lost in 2016.

Internal Democratic polling shows that healthcare and the Republican tax cuts that some voters view as a giveaway to wealthy Americans and corporations are winning issues for Democrats this November. Healthcare has proven a particularly potent issue in the House, which had repeatedly voted to repeal Obamacare over the past eight years.

Republicans have not given up their focus on the tax cut and continued economic recovery.

Doug Thornell, a former spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said that in tight Senate and House races, Republicans who have tried to rally Trump’s base of supporters by aligning themselves with the president were paying a price with independent voters.

“(Republicans) really don’t have much of a choice. They have to embrace him, or they suffer the consequences,” Thornell said. “When they embrace him, it turns off a whole bunch of voters they need to win.”

"As voters head to the polls in the 2018 midterm elections Tuesday, a string of East Coast races could be early indicators on which party will win the battle for control of the U.S. House, while the fight for the U.S. Senate runs through a slate of tossup states that are in later time zones. Here’s your guide to watching the results roll in on Election Day, based on East Coast times.

The first polls begin closing at 6 p.m. Eastern in Kentucky and Indiana.

Kentucky and Indiana: Indiana has some polls closing at 6 p.m. Eastern. But the key race to watch is in Kentucky: the state’s sixth congressional district in Lexington. The seat is currently held by Republican Rep. Andy Barr, who represents an area where the GOP typically does well, but he is facing a well-financed opponent in retired Marine pilot Amy McGrath, a Democrat.

7 p.m. Eastern

Polls start to close in four key states: Virginia, Georgia, Florida and also Indiana, where a last batch of polls close in a state that is in two time zones. Polls also close in South Carolina.

Florida: Democrat Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, has attracted a grassroots following of young people and minorities. The party hopes Mr. Gillum’s campaign for governor against the GOP’s Ron DeSantis can bring more Democrats to the polls, all the while lifting the fortunes of incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, who is being challenged for his Senate seat by outgoing Republican Gov. Rick Scott.

On the House side, the four most competitive races to watch are all prime pick opportunities for the Democrats: FL-26 and FL-27, two GOP-held districts that encompass part of the Miami-Dade region; FL-15 outside Tampa; and FL-16 in Sarasota County.

Indiana: Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, one of the party’s most vulnerable incumbents, is being challenged by businessman Mike Braun. Republicans are looking to capture this seat to expand their 51-49 Senate majority or to create a buffer to offset loses elsewhere.

Georgia: The governor’s race between progressive former state lawmaker Stacey Abrams and Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, a Republican, is one of the most watched in the country. She could make history by becoming the first black female governor in the U.S.

There are also two key House races to watch: Georgia’s sixth congressional district, home of a special election last year that launched this year’s fierce fight for control of the chamber, where Rep. Karen Handel is facing Democrat Lucy McBath. The race illustrates how both parties this year have battled over suburban, educated women. The other is Georgia’s seventh congressional district, where GOP Rep. Rob Woodall faces a tight race with Democratic challenger Carolyn Bourdeaux.

Virginia: There are several opportunities for House Democrats to pick up seats. Rep. Barbara Comstock, an incumbent in the Washington, D.C., suburbs, is considered among the most vulnerable Republicans as she squares off against Democrat Jennifer Wexton.

A more significant bellwether could be in Virginia’s second congressional district, where GOP Rep. Scott Taylor faces a stiff challenge from Democratic businesswoman Elaine Luria. And Republican Rep. Dave Brat, who ousted Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a 2014 primary, is now in danger of losing his seat to Democrat Abigail Spanberger.

7:30 p.m. Eastern

Polls start to close in three states: North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia.

Ohio: The governor’s race in Ohio is nationally watched because 2016 GOP presidential candidate John Kasich is leaving the governor’s mansion due to term limits. Republican Mike DeWine faces Democrat Richard Cordray in the race to follow Mr. Kasich.

A rematch in Ohio’s 12th congressional district in suburban Columbus could also be telling. Rep. Troy Balderson won a special election there this year—but just barely beating Democrat Danny O’Connor—signaling the GOP’s weakening grip in suburbia.

West Virginia: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin’s state voted for President Trump in 2016 by 42 percentage points. Yet, Mr. Manchin is leading attorney general Patrick Morrisey in public polling, and a victory would demonstrate that a candidate’s personal brand can outweigh party affiliation.

What to Watch: 8 p.m. to 9 p.m.

At 8 p.m. Eastern, the largest set of states will close, including eight states with competitive Senate races. Statewide competitive races 8 p.m.: Senate S TN MI PA MO MS TX ND IL CT NJ G Governor KS OK MD RI SD Other states closing: DE AL MA ME AR Competitive House races closing Democrat-held Republican-held Tossup Likely Democrat Lean Republican Likely Republican Lean Democrat

8 p.m. Eastern

Polls start to close in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.

Kansas: The governor’s race is a tossup between Republican Kris Kobach and Democrat Laura Kelly, and there are two potential House upsets. GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder’s seat in the third House district is at risk of falling into the Democratic column, as the race now leans in favor of challenger Sharice Davids. There is also a tossup race for an open seat in the state’s second congressional district, where Rep. Lynn Jenkins, a Republican, is retiring.

Michigan: GOP Rep. Mike Bishop, whose eighth district includes a swath of the Detroit suburbs, faces a tough challenger in Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA case officer, creating a key pick-up opportunity for Democrats.

Mississippi: There are two Senate races in the state, but one of them is unlikely to be decided Tuesday night. That’s because GOP Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith isn’t the only Republican vying for the seat: Republican Chris McDaniel is running against her, as is Democrat Mike Espy, creating a three-way race. The top two vote-getters advance to a Nov. 27 runoff if none of them can claim an outright majority of the vote on Election Day, under Mississippi election rules.

Missouri: Sen. Claire McCaskill is another endangered Democrat in the Senate. She faces state Attorney General Josh Hawley. President Trump made two trips to the state in the final days to try to knock off Ms. McCaskill.

New Jersey: Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, plagued by questions over his ethics despite escaping conviction in a corruption trial last year, is unpopular in a state that leans Democratic. He faces GOP businessman Bob Hugin. If Republicans can defeat Mr. Menendez, it would bode well for their ability to maintain control of the Senate.

Voters across the country will head to the polls Tuesday to cast their votes in the general election. The WSJ`s Gerald F. Seib explains five areas that are worth watching as results come in. Photo: Getty

Pennsylvania: There are four competitive U.S. House races in Pennsylvania, all of them pick-up opportunities for the Democrats, and they are looking here to make a strong down payment on their path toward a majority. Republicans have called this “ground zero” in the battle for House control. Several districts moved further out of reach for Republicans due to court-issued redistricting in the state.

Tennessee: The open Senate seat in Tennessee—Republican Sen. Bob Corker is retiring—is critical to Democrats if they have any hope of gaining ground in the chamber. Former Gov. Phil Bredesen, who was endorsed by singer Taylor Swift, is challenging Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who benefited from a Trump endorsement.

Texas: Can Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke topple GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in a deep-red state? It would be one of the biggest political upsets in the history of the Senate, and a signal that the Lone Star state could be in play during the 2020 presidential race.

Also in Texas, Democrats are targeting Republican Reps. Pete Sessions in a district outside Dallas and John Culberson of Houston, both in tossup races. A defeat of Rep. Will Hurd, who is facing Democrat Gina Ortiz-Jones, would signal a difficult night for Republicans.

What to Watch: 9 p.m. to 10 p.m.

At 9 p.m., polls start closing in Minnesota, which includes the only toss up and lean Republican seats held by Democrats.

9 p.m. Eastern

Officials start counting ballots in Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York and Wisconsin.

Arizona: An open Senate seat creates a rare opening for Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema to gain a seat for her party, but her fight against Rep. Martha McSally has been extremely tight. The seat is open because Sen. Jeff Flake, a Republican, is retiring.

Minnesota: Four races in Minnesota are a bellwether for control of the House. Both parties agree that if Democrats win in three of these four districts, it would be a bad sign for the GOP elsewhere in the country. The four races are:

MN-01: Democrats currently hold this seat in rural Minnesota. If they can hang on, it may mean they are faring better in rural areas than they often get credit for. Democrat Dan Feehan faces Republican Jim Hagedorn in that open-seat race.

MN-02: GOP Rep. Jason Lewis faces a stiff challenge from Democrat Angie Craig in outskirts of the Twin Cities.

MN-03: Republican Rep. Erik Paulsen faces Democrat Dean Phillips, presenting another test for the GOP in the suburbs.

MN-08: This is a seat the GOP is supposed to flip and create a small buffer against any other losses. Republican Pete Stauber is matched up with Democrat Joe Radinovich.

What to Watch: 10 p.m. and Later

Polls start to close in Iowa, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota and Utah.

Nevada, Montana, North Dakota: These three states will likely determine control of the Senate. Democratic Sens. Jon Tester of Montana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota are hoping to win in states President Trump took in 2016. Mr. Tester’s race is a tossup against Republican Matt Rosendale; Ms. Heitkamp’s race is leaning in favor of her Republican opponent, Rep. Kevin Cramer.

In Nevada, Republican Sen. Dean Heller, the chamber’s most vulnerable GOP incumbent, battles Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen.

11 p.m. Eastern

Polls start to close in California, Oregon and Washington state. Oregon and Washington have all-mail voting, but ballots can be turned in as late as 8 p.m. local time; that’s 11 p.m. on the East Coast. The races to watch:

California: If the battle for the U.S. House isn’t determined by 11 p.m. when polls close in California, there are seven competitive seats here that could settle the outcome:

Newsletter Sign-up

CA-10 (tossup): GOP Rep. Jeff Denham faces Democrat Josh Harder.

CA-25 (tossup): GOP Rep. Steve Knight faces Democrat Katie Hill.

CA-39 (tossup): In a race for an open GOP seat, Republican Young Kim is being challenged by Democrat Gil Cisneros.

CA-45 (tossup): GOP Rep. Mimi Walters is up against Democrat Katie Porter.

CA-48 (tossup): GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher faces Democratic businessman Harley Rouda.

CA-49 (leaning Democratic): Democratic lawyer Mike Levin is leading Republican Diane Harkey in polls.

CA-50 (leaning Republican): GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter faces Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar.

Oregon: Oregon may elect a GOP governor for the first time in 36 years. Republican Knute Buehler is campaigning for voters unhappy with Democratic Gov. Kate Brown—and President Trump. Mr. Buehler said he wrote in Ohio’s moderate Republican Gov. Kasich in the 2016 presidential election rather than back Mr. Trump.

Washington: The state’s southwestern corner has seen an influx of nearly $2 million in new spending from both parties, indicating that the seat held for four terms by GOP Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler is in jeopardy. Her opponent is Democrat Carolyn Long.

12 a.m. Eastern

Polls close in Alaska.

Alaska Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, suspended his re-election bid less than three weeks before the election. The move came three days after the sudden resignation of Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott over what Mr. Walker described as an inappropriate overture toward a woman. The three-way governor’s race is leaning in favor of Republican candidate Mike Dunleavy over Democrat Mark Begich but after such a recent scandal, the outcome is hard to call.

Amplification:

Indiana has some polls closing at 6 p.m. Eastern. But a last batch of polls close at 7 p.m. Eastern in Indiana because the state is in two time zones.

"T HE MID-TERMS happened a month ago, but are still not over. When the dust settles at last, the Democrats will pick up between 39 and 41 of the House of Representatives’ 435 seats, a net gain larger than any of their “wave” elections since 1974, the cycle after Watergate forced Richard Nixon from office. In the Senate, Democrats held on to seats in six states that Donald Trump won in 2016 and gained one in Arizona, though lost out in Florida, Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota. The morning after the election it appeared that the result reflected a revolt in the suburbs, and by college-educated women, against the president’s party. That was true, but with a bit more distance and number-crunching it is clear that this is not the whole story.

Democrats did far better in rural America, particularly in the rural Midwest, than is commonly understood. If the baseline is how Hillary Clinton performed in 2016, Democrats actually saw their largest increase in vote share in rural constituencies, especially those in the Midwest (see chart). Compared with Mrs Clinton’s performance in 2016, the average rural House district was eight points more Democratic this year, compared with a five-point Democratic outperformance in suburban districts and three points in urban seats.

According to an analysis by Catalist, a political-data firm, working-class white voters in rural areas across the country shifted their votes towards Democrats by seven points. For blue-collar suburbanites, the difference was just two. Yet Democrats managed only 11 upsets in rural congressional districts, compared with 28 in the suburbs, because the party’s candidates start so far behind in sparsely populated places.

Why did the vote tallies in rural America look so different this time round? One answer is turnout, rather than shifting loyalties. Numbers from the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group, a group of public-opinion researchers, suggest that only 1.5% of voters went for Mr Obama in 2012, Mr Trump in 2016 and a Democrat in 2018. Not many voters change their minds.

That is not the only answer, though. Some political scientists argue that Mr Trump’s 2016 presidential candidacy saw a political realignment. The divisions between whites and non-whites (especially blacks and Muslims) were more important to a candidate’s success than at any time in the past century, according to political scientists John Sides, Michael Tesler and Lynn Vavreck, who write about the power of white identity in their new book, “Identity Crisis: The 2016 Presidential Campaign and the Battle for the Meaning of America”. Whiter, less educated areas of the country swung hard towards the insurgent Mr Trump in 2016. In 2018 the issue of race was not on their minds to the same extent.

According to The Economist’s analysis of survey data from the Voter Study Group, feelings of racial resentment and anti-immigrant sentiment were less predictive of white Democrats’ vote choices this year than in 2016. With Mr Trump not on the ballot, white members of the Obama coalition in the Midwest who deserted Mrs Clinton returned to their past allegiances. They were also freer to think of issues like health care. A study from Morning Consult, a public pollster, found voters who identified health care as the nation’s most important issue were 28 percentage points more likely to vote for Democrats than Republicans.

It could be that this year’s Democratic House candidates were simply more appealing than Mrs Clinton. Democratic Senators such as Sherrod Brown, Jon Tester and Joe Manchin enjoyed success even as their states of Ohio, Montana and West Virginia have drifted further and further towards Republicans, suggesting that individuals can still sometimes trump partisan allegiance. It may also be that racially conservative, ancestrally Democratic rural whites were just allergic to Mrs Clinton.

The fact that the Democratic Party is not yet dead to rural whites matters for its future. The past few elections have suggested that an electoral coalition of college-educated whites and non-white voters does not have enough bodies to propel the party to political power on its own. If the next presidential election is like the one in 2016, when working-class whites fled from the Democrats at astonishing speed, the party’s candidate will struggle. If it is like 2018’s, when more stuck around, the nominee’s prospects will be much better.", The mid-term autopsy ,12-2018

"Some red-state Senate Democrats are fretting that the ongoing House impeachment inquiry could expand uncontrollably and become a “kitchen sink” of complaints about President Trump, Fox News has learned.

West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Montana Sen. Jon Tester specifically expressed concerns about a broadening impeachment push severely damaging Democrats` chances to win back a Senate majority next year, sources told Fox News.

The senators have told Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., that leadership cannot allow liberal Democrats to push for the inquiry to include allegations about Trump illegally using his office to enrich himself or relitigate findings from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian election meddling in 2016.

BIDEN CAMPAIGN SEEKS TO BAN GIULIANI FROM TELEVISION, AFTER HE OUTLINES ALLEGED CORRUPTION, CITES AFFIDAVITS

Instead, Manchin and Tester said, the inquiry should stay very narrowly focused on Ukraine. Last month, a whistleblower complaint was released alleging Trump, holding back on Ukraine military aid, pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to look into former Vice President Joe Biden`s push to oust a top prosecutor there. This, while his son Hunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.

Trump and the White House have denied doing anything wrong in the call.

A former senior party aide told Fox News: “If Democrats lose focus on the charges of foreign corruption and election interference, so will voters. Democrats need to stay laser-focused on one issue and not allow their base to drag them in 20 different directions. They saw this playbook work in 2018 where they focused on health care. Hopefully, they will run the same play with impeachment.”

Immediately after Democrats launched their formal impeachment inquiry last month, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., openly declared that Ukraine was just one of many reasons to begin proceedings against the president.

“What is going on is that the president has committed several impeachable offenses. He, himself, what he has admitted to, is already impeachable, regardless of future developments,” Ocasio-Cortez said, referencing potential Emoluments Clause violations.

PROOF OF LINKS? FOX OBTAINS PHOTO OF JOE, HUNTER BIDEN GOLFING WITH UKRAINE EXEC BEFORE PROSECUTOR FIRED

She also said this past April, “I think you could reach in a bag and pull so many things out that are impeachable of this president.”

The conversations came as a new poll showed American voters evenly split -- 47 percent to 47 percent -- on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office. The findings in a Quinnipiac University national survey released Monday erased a 20-point gap against impeaching the president in the previous Quinnipiac poll seen just a week ago. In the earlier survey, voters opposed impeachment, 57 percent to 37 percent.

Polling in key swing states, however, has not been made available. The formal impeachment inquiry began last month after a flurry of swing-district Democrats in the House pushed Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to act.

Speaking to Fox News on Monday, former Attorney General Eric Holder said it was impossible to be sure what impact impeachment proceedings would have.

“I`m not sure that anyone can really gauge that,” Holder said. “I`m not sure if this is going to help Democrats or hurt Democrats, but I think it`s the right thing to do.”

""I`m not sure if this is going to help Democrats or hurt Democrats."" — Former Attorney General Eric Holder

In a separate interview on Monday, Holder suggested Democrats might have a tough election year -- for a head-turning reason.

“It`s going to be hard because the reality is that Republicans are going to cheat. They`re going to try to keep people away from the polls, they`re going to move polling places, they`re going to do a whole variety of things,” Holder told “The Breakfast Club” radio show.

Meanwhile, Fox News has confirmed that State Department Inspector General Steve Linick will come to Capitol Hill to meet with House and Senate Committee aides Wednesday regarding the Ukraine matter.

Tension between Congressional Democrats and the State Department has grown in connection with the Ukraine matter; questions have arisen over permitting State Department-related witnesses to appear for transcribed interviews and provide documents for the impeachment probe.

For now, most Democrats have remained focused on the Ukraine inquiry, and on Monday they subpoenaed Rudy Giuliani, the president`s personal lawyer. That was after one of Trump`s staunchest defenders, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he would have “no choice” but to consider articles of impeachment if the House approved them.

STUDY SHOWS MEDIA LARGELY IGNORING ALLEGED BIDEN CORRUPTION IN UKRAINE

With Congress out of session for the Jewish holidays, Democrats moved aggressively against Giuliani, requesting that by Oct. 15 he produce “text messages, phone records and other communications” that they consider possible evidence of misdeeds in connection with the Ukraine matter. They also requested documents and depositions from three of his business associates.

Biden`s presidential campaign has itself targeted Giuliani, requesting in a letter on Sunday that major news networks not invite him on air anymore, after Giuliani spent the morning on a series of talk shows aggressively highlighting what he called Biden`s apparently corrupt dealings in Ukraine and China.

Republicans have continued to raise money over Democrats` impeachment efforts, as they sought to use the probe to fundraise and highlight Dems` own potential misconduct. Top Democrats seeking the White House took in a collective $56 million over the last three months, but in a sign of what they`re up against, Trump and his allies raised $125 million.

Top Republicans have increasingly questioned details concerning the whistleblower complaint that has formed the basis of the impeachment inquiry. The inspector general for the intelligence community said late Monday that the whistleblower claimed to have firsthand knowledge of misconduct -- a claim that appeared to conflict with documents sent to Congress and the director of national intelligence.

""As I learn more and more each day,"" Trump tweeted late Tuesday, ""I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America!""

Red-state Dems worried Trump impeachment push will kill hopes of retaking Senate in 2020

Some red-state Senate Democrats are fretting that the ongoing House impeachment inquiry could expand uncontrollably and become a “kitchen sink” of complaints about President Trump and hurt chances of regaining the Senate majority in 2020, Fox News has learned. Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana specifically expressed concerns and have told Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., that leadership cannot allow liberal Democrats to push for the inquiry to include allegations about Trump illegally using his office to enrich himself or relitigate findings from former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian election meddling in 2016.

In other developments: Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said Tuesday he’s considering individual lawsuits against House Democrats for allegedly violating the constitutional and civil rights of the president and members of his administration amid new congressional inquiries and subpoenas resulting from a whistleblower’s complaint.

Reps. Eliot Engel, Adam Schiff and Elijah Cummings, the Democratic chairmen of three House committees, informed the State Department in a letter late Tuesday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to have a ""conflict of interest"" and might now be a ""fact witness"" in their ongoing impeachment inquiry, after Pompeo accused Dems of trying to ""bully"" foreign service officers into testifying.

Trump inquired about shooting migrants at the border, using trench filled with deadly reptiles: new book

A new report from the New York Times on Tuesday shows the extraordinary measures President Trump inquired about as part of his push to secure the U.S.-Mexico border. In an excerpt from their upcoming book, ""Border Wars: Inside Trump’s Assault on Immigration,"" Times reporters Michael Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis allege that Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of installing a ""water-filled trench"" and stocking it with deadly reptiles. He also suggested shooting migrants in the legs to ""slow them down.""

A source who was in the room at the time confirmed the conversation about shooting migrants in the legs to Fox News late Tuesday.

Federal judge rules for Harvard in affirmative action case

A federal judge on Tuesday ruled against families suing Harvard for allegedly discriminating against Asian-American applicants in a blow to activists who hoped to chip away at affirmative action programs. U.S. District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs said Harvard had a compelling interest to consider race in admissions because of the benefits of a diverse student body, citing Supreme Court precedent from the 1978 affirmative action case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke. Burroughs said Harvard`s program was ""not perfect"" but ruled that it tread lightly enough in considering race that it could be considered constitutional. The organization representing the plaintiffs, Students for Fair Admissions, said it will appeal the decision.

Johnson & Johnson agrees to settle opioid case in Ohio for $20 million

Johnson & Johnson and its Janssen Pharmaceutical subsidiary reached a deal worth more than $20 million with two Ohio counties - Cuyahoga and Summit - late Tuesday night to avoid trial in the opioid addiction crisis. The conglomerate is the fifth drug company to reach a settlement with the two counties in order to avoid the first federal trial over the nation`s opioids crisis. J&J is not admitting liability in the settlement, which calls for the company to pay $10 million to the counties, and includes provisions for the company to reimburse the counties up to $5 million for legal expenses. The company will also contribute another $5.4 million to nonprofit organizations that deal with opioids.

Over the course of the past few years, Salesforce co-CEO Marc Benioff has criticized a law that he said discriminated against LGBT people; bickered with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey about who was doing more to address homelessness and stopped selling things like bump stocks on its e-commerce platform.

Continue Reading Below

Benioff maintains that he’s not trying to be an activist CEO, but that he’s merely trying to fight battles on behalf of his employees.

“I didn’t become this activist CEO,” Benioff told Fortune. “I got pushed by my employees into it. My job as CEO is to listen deeply to my employees and customers and to respond to them effectively.”

Benioff isn’t the only chief executive to wade into social and political strifes recently. He joins a handful of business leaders who sit at the helm of some of the world’s biggest companies in making a habit of speaking out -- and fighting against -- about what they perceive as injustices.

FOX Business takes a closer look at some of the more-prominent so-called activist CEOs who are getting involved in contentious public debates ranging from laws affecting transgender people in North Carolina to climate change.

PayPal CEO Dan Schulman: Under Schulman’s leadership, PayPal in 2016 canceled plans to open a global operations center in Charlotte, North Carolina and invest $3.6 million in the area after the state legislature passed a controversial law targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender citizens, according to Reuters.

PayPal was the first major business to protest North Carolina’s law, which required transgender people to use restrooms in many public bathrooms that correlated to their sex at birth.

Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein: Although Blankfein stepped down as CEO of Goldman Sachs in 2018, during his tenure at the helm of the bank, he was known for being a vocal LGBT-rights advocate. In 2012, he became a national spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBT advocacy group and political lobbying organization in the country.

Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario: Marcario joined the outdoor retailer in 2008 and has taken a markedly political course over the past several years. Patagonia, in the midterm elections, endorsed two candidates: Democrats Rep. Jacky Rosen in Nevada and Sen. Jon Tester in Montana, both of whom won their races, according to Inc.

And, in 2017, Patagonia -- which openly describes itself as an “activist company” -- sued the Trump administration for reducing the size of two national monuments in Utah, including Bear Eyes and Grand Staircase-Escalante. When Trump first announced the news about the monuments, Patagonia wiped its website and replaced it with a stark message: “The President Stole Your Land.”

The company also donated $10 million -- its savings in tax cuts -- to environmental programs.

“Taxes fund our important public services, our first responders and our democratic institutions,” Marcario wrote in a message on LinkedIn. “Taxes protect the most vulnerable in our society, our public lands and other life-giving resources.

"President Trump has long promised to create jobs, and has consistently delivered -- especially in his own White House and Cabinet, where rapid turnover is showing no signs of slowing down as 2018 comes to a close.

High-profile departures in the Trump administration -- from former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and Press Secretary Sean Spicer to fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (whom Trump recently characterized as ""lazy as hell"" and ""dumb as a rock"") -- have attracted the most attention. They have contributed to what some analysts have called an unprecedented number of high-level Cabinet departures going back 100 years.

The most popular parlor game in Washington right now centers on who will replace outgoing Chief of Staff John Kelly.

TRUMP REVEALS CHIEF OF STAFF SEARCH DOWN TO 5 CANDIDATES

""At some point, everybody leaves,"" Trump told ""60 Minutes"" host Lesley Stahl in October. ""Everybody. People leave. That`s Washington.""

But dozens of Executive Branch offices, both inside and outside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, have emptied and filled at historic rates, with and without fanfare. The exits have included unfriendly dismissals, voluntary moves to the private sector, and other resignations.

The headline-grabbing departures include two national security advisers -- H.R. McMaster and Michael Flynn, who was booted for misleading the White House about conversations with the Russian ambassador and is now facing sentencing for lying to the FBI. John Bolton now runs the national security ship.

Before Kelly, former GOP chairman Reince Priebus also came and went at the helm of the White House operation. He has since dished on the drama inside the Oval Office in the book ""The Gatekeepers.""

""Take everything you`ve heard and multiply it by 50,"" Priebus said.

Within the Cabinet, Attorney General Jeff Sessions was the latest to be forced out, submitting his resignation the day after the midterms at the request of the president. Trump spent the last year publicly criticizing his DOJ leader for recusing himself in the Russia probe and opening the door to the special counsel investigation. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned over the summer amid numerous ethics scandals, replaced by Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler. Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin was pushed out amid his own ethics controversy. U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley also is planning to leave, without controversy, and State Department official and former Fox News journalist Heather Nauert is Trump`s pick to succeed her.

Within the White House, the National Security Council has been the scene of considerable turnover, and not just at the top.

Senior Director for Africa Robin Townley, for example, left the administration in early 2017 after the CIA refused to grant him an elite-level Sensitive Compartmented Information security clearance that he needed to serve on the National Security Council (NSC).

Townley, a top deputy to Flynn, had long held a less selective top-secret security clearance related to his service as a Marine. Sources told Politico that Flynn and Townley viewed the rejection as a ""hit job from inside the CIA on Flynn and the people close to him"" because of Townley`s critical views of the intelligence community.

Ezra Cohen-Watnick was reportedly forced out as a senior intelligence director at the NSC as well, for supposedly leaking information about so-called ""unmasking"" activities by Obama administration officials to California Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee. (“Unmasking” involves asking U.S. intelligence authorities to fill in the redacted names of U.S. citizens whose comments are caught up in intelligence agencies` foreign intelligence intercepts, which are routinely removed to protect their Fourth Amendment rights. Such revelations are supposed to be relatively rare, clearly justified and tightly controlled.)

MELANIA TRUMP`S OFFICE ISSUES STRIKING STATEMENT CALLING FOR WH STAFFER`S TERMINATION

Cohen-Watnick`s attorney denied the allegations, saying that “he never showed the documents to Nunes,"" had never ""met with Nunes"" and had ""nothing to do with Nunes.” Bloomberg reported that Trump personally directed the Department of Justice to hire Cohen-Watnick after the episode.

Several other relatively low-profile White House staffers who had key roles in major developments have also left their posts in the past two years. Keith Schiller, the president`s longtime personal bodyguard who attracted scrutiny after being photographed accidentally exposing Defense Secretary James Mattis` phone number, has departed as director of Oval Office operations.

""At some point, everybody leaves. Everybody. People leave. That`s Washington."" — President Trump

Schiller famously hand-delivered the notice of FBI Director James Comey`s termination to FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C. in May 2017 -- but Comey was not there, and instead learned of his sudden firing from a television news report while in Los Angeles.

Also departed is White House Counsel Don McGahn, who oversaw not only the White House`s response to Special Counsel Robert Mueller`s probe, but also the contentious confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh amid a series of lurid and uncorroborated sexual misconduct allegations. McGahn, who left in October, has been replaced by Pat Cipollone.

In a rare interview, Trump`s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner told Fox News` ""Hannity"" exclusively on Monday that Cipollone ""is going to be fabulous.""

Marc Short, Trump`s former legislative affairs director and a former high-level aide to Vice President Mike Pence, left the White House in July to consult and become a fellow at the University of Virginia`s Miller Center School of Public Affairs. His appointment to the one-year fellowship prompted fierce, partisan backlash from students and faculty at UVA.

TRUMP CABINET OFFICIALS IN THE CROSSHAIRS AS DEMS AIM TO RAMP UP INVESTIGATIONS

Short, who previously obtained his MBA from UVA, departed just as the confirmation battle over Kavanaugh was intensifying. His record as the White House`s liaison to Capitol Hill staffers and politicians was largely seen as successful, even if some of the results he oversaw were mixed.

Although he helped ensure the passage of Trump`s historic $1.5 trillion tax overhaul last year, Short was unable to push the president`s longstanding effort to repeal ObamaCare over the finish line. That legislative measure -- panned by Democrats and some Republicans for failing to offer a viable health care alternative -- was defeated in a dramatic 11th-hour vote by the late Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain.

The White House tapped Shahira Knight, who had served on the White House`s National Economic Council and played a major role in developing the tax legislation, to replace Short.

Other exits from the Trump orbit have been comparably ugly and unceremonious.

White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter was forced to resign earlier this year after two of his ex-wives came forward with domestic abuse allegations. Trump has reportedly expressed a desire to see Porter return to the White House at some point.

Former Deputy National Security adviser Mira Ricardel also lost her post last month after an unusual public spat with first lady Melania Trump. The Wall Street Journal reported in mid-November that Ricardel had clashed with the first lady`s staff over seating arrangements on a plane during her October trip to Africa. The paper added that the first lady`s office suspected Ricardel of leaking negative stories about the first lady and her staff.

TRACKING SOME NOTABLE TRUMP CABINET DEPARTURES: FROM AG SESSIONS TO UN REP NIKKI HALEY AND EPA HEAD SCOTT PRUITT

Dr. Ronny Jackson, formerly Trump`s personal physician and nominee to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, is now neither after he was besieged by unproven and disputed allegations compiled by Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester’s office concerning his prescription-drug practices and use of alcohol. (Trump has bitterly feuded with Tester, the top Democrat on the Republican-controlled Senate Veteran Affairs Committee, ever since the episode.)

Perhaps the most storied and colorful departure was that of Anthony Scaramucci, who left as communications director after a mere 11 days on the job (or 10, depending how you count it). Trump confidant Hope Hicks assumed the job, then resigned early this year.

The flurry of departures from the White House has continued into 2018`s final weeks. Pence Chief of Staff Nick Ayers announced Sunday he will leave the White House at the end of the year, leaving unclear who will replace Kelly, as Ayers was the favorite for that role.

White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway told Fox News on Tuesday that Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, might stay on briefly into the new year while the president finds a replacement.

For his part, Trump has clearly signaled that replacements for other roles are very likely coming up in the new year.

""Yeah, other people will go, sure,"" Trump told Stahl in the ""60 Minutes"" interview. ""We have a great Cabinet. There are some people I`m not happy with. I have some people that I`m not thrilled with. And I have other people that I`m beyond thrilled with."""," Turnover in Trump Cabinet, White House shows no sign of slowing amid new departures ",12-2018

"Many American families – busy getting into their autumn routines of juggling work, school and extra-curricular activities – are just now beginning to focus on who to vote for in the midterm elections Tuesday.

The central question people have to consider is this: Are you better off today than you were two years ago?

A lot has happened in the two years since the American people voted to make Donald Trump our president.

President Trump, the ultimate political outsider, has cemented his reputation as a leader who makes promises and keeps promises.

Despite unprecedented obstruction by Democrats, President Trump and Republicans in Congress have spent the past two years working to enact the president’s America First agenda.

First and foremost, the president`s historic tax cut and deregulation program have kicked our economy into overdrive. Millions of jobs have been created. Unemployment is at its lowest level since 1969.

Yet Democrats voted in unison to oppose the Trump policies that led to all this good economic news.

The Senate has confirmed Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to serve as justices on the Supreme Court – yet another enormous accomplishment for the president. The two justices will be staunch defenders of the Constitution, safeguarding our liberties on our nation’s highest court for decades to come.

North Korea is no longer testing missiles and nuclear bombs, thanks to the president`s foreign policy of peace through strength.

And President Trump has moved our embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, something that many presidents promised, but never did.

Despite complete Democratic resistance on health-care reform and tough border security measures, the president has managed to get the awful individual mandate scrapped and border wall construction underway.

Because of this outstanding record, here we are less than a week before the midterm elections and Republicans are squarely in the game.

In Senate elections, seats once considered likely to go to Democrats are looking better for Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., and Rep. Martha McSally, R-Ariz.

In Nevada, eye-grabbing headlines like ""Unemployment rates drop across Nevada last month,"" appear to be causing people to move toward re-electing Heller and making Republican Adam Laxalt the next governor.

Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, the Democratic Senate candidate in Arizona, has been exposed as a left-wing radical.

If Republicans manage to hold onto the seats in Arizona and Nevada, they could be looking at picking up three or four seats in the Senate.

Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer looks like a safe bet to defeat Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota.

Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley is running strong against Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in Missouri.

In Indiana, the latest polling shows that Republican businessman Mike Braun is running ahead of Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly by a margin of 46 to 43 percent.

Similarly, conservative Republican Senate candidates Patrick Morrisey in West Virginia, Matt Rosendale in Montana and Gov.Rick Scott in Florida are all in the hunt in their races in states that President Trump carried.

While the outlook in the U.S. House is far more uncertain, a consensus is emerging among those closing tracking the races that a blue wave may not be coming after all.

This decline in optimism among Democrats may be due to reality setting in among American voters. Men and women across our country are concerned about the liberal agenda of tax hikes, open borders, blowing up Medicare, and trying to impeach any conservative in high office who they don’t like.

What the Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearing in the Senate and the pending caravan invasion of Central American migrants make clear is that the left is inviting chaos to America. Hardworking American taxpayers are wary of it.

The massive mob of migrants currently working their way through Mexico hell-bent on entering America illegally confirms that serious border security laws must be passed by Congress without delay.

These caravans will become the rule – not the exception – if Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., becomes speaker of the House again.

I wouldn’t be surprised if the majority in the House of Representatives is decided by five to 10 seats either way. House races where strong Republican women are running – like Barbara Comstock in Virginia, Claudia Tenney in New York, Maria Salazar in Florida, Lena Epstein in Michigan, Wendy Rogers in Arizona and Young Kim in California – could decide who controls the House in 2019.

A Media Research Center report found that 92 percent of the mainstream media`s news coverage of President Trump has been negative. When you consider the onslaught of fake news that this president has had to endure for the past two years, the fact that the House is still in play for Republicans a week before the election is an accomplishment in itself.

When it comes to voting for your representative in Congress, the American people need to consider the past two years.

It`s clear that President Trump`s foreign and domestic policies have paved the way for more security and prosperity for all Americans. We can`t afford to go back.

A vote for a Pelosi majority in Congress is a vote for crippling gridlock in government and a continuation of the partisan and divisive investigations into the 2016 election. I hope that gives Americans pause.

A vote to keep the levers of government out of the hands of the leftwing mob is a vote for more economic prosperity, common sense border security and a chance to finally move past the 2016 election and start to heal – and unit – as one nation with shared hopes and dreams for a better future.", Trump successes are boosting GOP candidates in midterms – Don’t expect a blue wave ,11-2018
"Montana’s U.S. Senate race took a dramatic turn on Wednesday: A libertarian candidate endorsed his Republican opponent after an illegal campaign mailer tried to siphon votes from the GOP candidate and pave victory for the incumbent Democrat.

Republican Matt Rosendale is in a dead-heat race against Democrat Jon Tester, with polls showing the GOP candidate trailing within the margin of error. Fox News deems the race “leaning Democrat.”

But Libertarian Rick Breckenridge, who has no chance of winning the race, took an unprecedented step in Montana politics and endorsed Rosendale, saying he’s taking a stand against “dark money” in politics.

DEM SEN. TESTER CAMPAIGNS ON HUNTING, HASN`T HAD LICENSE IN 6 YEARS

The move came after an anonymous campaign mailer from an unknown group, which is a violation of state and federal election laws, went out to people in a bid to garner support for the Libertarian candidate and thus undermine Rosendale’s election chances.

“Matt Rosendale wants to use drones and patrols to spy on our private lives,” the mailer read. “Rick Breckenridge is a true conservative and opposes government intrusion into Montanans` private lives.”

It remains unclear who’s responsible for the mailer, but the tactic resembles the efforts by Democratic groups that supported Tester’s 2012 bid, where a mailer was sent out to promote another libertarian candidate.

Tester won that race by 4 percentage points thanks to the Libertarian candidate who received over 6 percent of the vote – just enough votes to swing the election if the votes had gone to the Republican candidate at the time.

KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION BATTLE GALVANIZES MONTANA’S REPUBLICAN VOTERS, COULD SWING SENATE RACE

Breckenridge deemed the mailer an attempt to influence the election, prompting his endorsement of the Republican, even though he disagrees with some of his views.

“The reality is I`m only going to get 3 or 4 percent of the vote, and [Rosendale] has the character to combat this issue,” Breckenridge told the Associated Press. “I`m standing in unity and solidarity with Matt to combat dark money in politics.”

""The reality is I`m only going to get 3 or 4 percent of the vote, and [Rosendale] has the character to combat this issue. I`m standing in unity and solidarity with Matt to combat dark money in politics."" — Libertarian candidate Rick Breckenridge

Rosendale accepted his opponent’s endorsement and went on to accuse the “allies of Tester” for distributing the “dark money mailer.”

Tester’s campaign denied responsibility and pushed back against the accusations.

“This is yet another lie from Matt Rosendale - our campaign had nothing to do with this mailer, and Jon believes all campaign expenditures should be disclosed,” Tester spokesman Chris Meagher said in a statement. “We condemn this mailer and any other efforts like it.”

The mailer encourages voters to back Libertarian or Independent candidates, seemingly as a way of siphoning off enough Republican votes to help Democrat incumbent Claire McCaskill. The Hawley campaign accused McCaskill`s team of being behind the mailers, a charge she denies.

The campaign mailers, which don’t state who paid for them as required by election laws, criticized the Republican candidate on gun rights and other issues and promoted other right-leaning candidates in an apparent effort to syphon votes from his campaign.

A similar illegal mailer was recently distributed in Montana’s Senate race, prompting Libertarian candidate Rick Breckenridge to endorse his Republican opponent Matt Rosendale over Democrat Jon Tester as a stand against “dark money” in politics.

DEMOCRAT TESTER`S CAMPAIGN TAKES A HIT AFTER SHADY MAILER PROMPTS LIBERTARIAN TO DROP OUT, BACK GOP CANDIDATE

Hawley has made strides against McCaskill, the incumbent Missouri senator, and is currently leading her in polls within the margin of error. The race is considered a tossup.

While third-party or Independent candidates aren’t gaining traction in this race, between 2 to 4 percent of voters are supporting them – enough to swing the election.

One anonymous mailer criticizes Hawley’s record on gun rights claiming he won’t “protect our gun rights” and then asks to support Libertarian candidate Japheth Campbell.

Hawley previously said that he would not vote to ban assault weapons, though he expressed support for measures improving background checks and keeping the firearms away from the hands of mentally ill people.

The National Rifle Association endorsed Hawley, calling him ""a champion of our Second Amendment freedoms."" The gun-rights group, meanwhile, gave an ""F"" rating to McCaskill.

Another mailer endorses Independent Senate candidate Craig O’Dear, while saying the Republican candidate “wants to make it harder to buy guns,” according to the Kansas City Star.

CLAIRE MCCASKILL`S SWIPE AT SANDERS, WARREN IGNORE FACT SHE ACCEPTED THEIR PAC MONEY, FUNDRAISING EFFORTS

O’Drear distanced himself from the mailers in a Facebook post on Monday, calling it “ugly” and “misleading.”

“The flyer, as described to us, attacks Josh Hawley for his Second Amendment position, and does so in a misleading manner,” he wrote. “It’s not ugly; it’s just misleading. Anyone who is familiar with our campaign would know the flyer makes no sense — it criticizes Hawley for purportedly taking positions we actually support.”

Meira Bernstein, McCaskill`s spokeswoman, told the newspaper: “Claire condemns all dark money efforts, including these mailers.

“Josh Hawley supports anonymous political giving, and Claire will continue to work hard to end it.”

In Montana, Republican Matt Rosendale similarly accused his Democratic opponent Jon Tester and his “allies” of being responsible for the mailers that claims he “wants to use drones and patrols to spy on” private citizens.

Libertarian Rick Breckenridge endorsed Rosendale, saying “I`m standing in unity and solidarity with Matt to combat dark money in politics.”

Tester’s campaign denied the allegations. “This is yet another lie from Matt Rosendale - our campaign had nothing to do with this mailer, and Jon believes all campaign expenditures should be disclosed,” Tester spokesman Chris Meagher said in a statement. “We condemn this mailer and any other efforts like it.”", Missouri Republican Josh Hawley targeted by illegal mailer on gun rights despite NRA endorsement ,11-2018
"Facebook admitted late Thursday that it improperly had removed two advertisements paid for by the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List that endorsed Republican Senate candidates.

On Thursday morning, the organization tweeted that Facebook had ""banned"" a 30-second ad supporting Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., in her race against Democratic former Gov. Phil Bredesen. The Susan B. Anthony List also tweeted a screenshot of an email from Facebook`s advertising team that read in part: ""Some of your ads aren`t approved because they don`t comply with our Advertising Policies.""

On Thursday afternoon, the Susan B. Anthony List said that Facebook had restored the Blackburn ad and apologized for dropping it in the first place.

""This ad does not violate Facebook`s policies and should never have been disapproved,"" the company said. ""We`re sorry for this mistake - the ad has been restored and is now running on Facebook.""

Approximately 25 minutes later, the Susan B. Anthony List tweeted that another of its ads had been ""banned."" This one was in support of Matt Rosendale, who is challenging incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Tester in Montana. In its tweet, the organization directly challenged Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, asking her: ""What`s the deal? Is #ProLife speech welcome on your platform or not?""

As before, the Susan B. Anthony List also tweeted a screenshot of an email from Facebook`s ad team. This one read: ""We have reviewed your ad more closely and have determined it doesn`t comply with our Advertising Policies.""

The group said late Thursday that Facebook had restored the Rosendale ad as well.

When contacted by Fox News, a Facebook spokesman said: ""Neither of these ads violate Facebook`s policies and they should never have been rejected. We’re sorry for this mistake - the ads have been restored and are now running on Facebook.""

MILLIONS SPENT IN MIDTERMS TO RALLY EVANGELICAL VOTERS

According to the Susan B. Anthony List, Facebook has removed six of its ads from public view since Oct. 9. One ad, about a little girl who survived a premature birth, has been removed five separate times despite repeated appeals from the group.​​​

""Which ads of Planned Parenthood’s has Facebook denied? Which pro-abortion candidates have they censored?"" Susan B. Anthony List spokeswoman Mallory Quigley said in a statement.

"Arizona Democratic Senate candidate Kyrsten Sinema was given a boost Thursday when the Green Party’s candidate dropped out and endorsed her -- a move that could give Sinema an edge over Republican Martha McSally in an airtight race.

""I want [supporters] to vote for a better Arizona, and that would be for Kyrsten Sinema,"" third-party candidate Angela Green told 12 News. ""After watching the debates and seeing everything, Sinema`s stance on a lot of things are very similar to mine.""

The decision, coming just days away from Tuesday’s midterm election, shakes up the already close race -- where polling has been particularly volatile.

A Fox News poll released this week had the race at a tie, while an ABC 15/OH Predictive Insights poll had McSally ahead by 7. On the flip side, an NBC News/Marist poll had Sinema ahead by 6 in a head-to-head, but that lead cut to 3 when factoring in Green -- who polled at 6 percent. The Real Clear Politics average of recent polls has Sinema ahead by 0.7 percent

Yet it is not clear what impact Green`s endorsement will have coming so late in the race. 12 News reports that, while the Green Party candidate picked up 5.5 percent of the vote in 2016, 60 percent of all votes have already been cast by mail-in ballot, and Green`s name will remain on the ballot.

It may also provide a difficult messaging moment for Sinema, who has sought to distance herself from her past as an anti-war and Green Party activist, and present herself as a moderate, independent candidate who can buck her party and sometimes vote with President Trump.

McSally has pushed back on that, pointing to a number of controversial statements Sinema made as an anti-war activist and contrasting Sinema’s activism with her own service as a fighter pilot after 9/11.

""While we were in harm`s way, she was protesting our troops in a pink tutu,"" McSally said in a debate last month.

MARTHA MCSALLY ACCUSES KYRSTEN SINEMA OF SUPPORTING TREASON` IN FIERY ARIZONA SENATE DEBATE

It also emerged last month that in a 2011 speech Sinema implied that her home state produced “crazy” as she advised liberal activists on how to “stop your state becoming Arizona.” In the speech, Sinema recounts how she was taught at a young age that Arizona was known for ""five Cs: cattle, copper, citrus, cotton and climate.""

""But I would add a sixth `C,`"" added Sinema, then an Arizona state senator. ""It`s called crazy.""

Green`s endorsement came a day after a similar development in Montana where Libertarian Rick Breckenridge endorsed Republican Matt Rosendale against Democratic Sen. Jon Tester as part of a stand against ""dark money"" in politics. Fox News Power Rankings has rated that race as ""lean Democrat.""

"Libertarian candidate Rick Breckenridge has backed away from his previous endorsement of Republican nominee Matt Rosendale just a day before Montanans are set to go the polls to vote in the state’s Senate race.

Breckenridge told Fox News that while he did use the word “endorse” in phone call with reporters last week, his “endorsement” was only on the issue of dark money. The Libertarian said he was angry about a campaign mailer urging voters to support the Libertarian candidate because Rosendale would bring more government surveillance if elected in November.

The funder of the mailer is unknown and it is a violation of federal campaign finance and election law not to attach a name to a mailer.

Breckenridge called the mailer “lies” and said that when it comes to dark money, he believes Rosendale is better than incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.

The Libertarian candidate added that he is not dropping out of the race, despite previous assertions that he was, and outlined a number of key stances where he and Rosendale differ, including the Republican’s support of President Trump’s border wall and tariffs on foreign goods.

“How can I endorse someone I’m that far apart from?” Breckenridge said.

Breckenridge’s comments on Monday stand in stark contrast to his words during last Wednesday’s conference call with reporters.

“I’m standing in unity and solidarity with Matt to combat dark money in Montana politics. I’m here to stand and say, with my 3 and 4 percent polling numbers, honestly I’m not going to take the seat,” Breckenridge said on the press call with Rosendale. ""I am here today to support Matt and his candidacy. And endorse him in his continuing effort to be the front man in the cause of liberty.”

The Montana Libertarian Party quickly disavowed Breckenridge’s endorsement last week.

“The Montana Libertarian Party continues to fully support and endorse Libertarian Rick Breckenridge for Senate,” the party said in a statement. “We believe he is still Montana`s best choice of the current candidates because he is a champion of freedom and limiting government while embracing cooperation and rational decision-making. He is neither a Trump acolyte like his Republican opponent, nor a promoter of fear and divisiveness to manipulate voters like his Democrat opponent.”

A recent HarrisX poll shows Tester holding a six point lead over Rosendale in a state President Trump handily won by 20 points in 2016. The president and other prominent Republicans have been barnstorming Montana in recent weeks in the hopes of flipping Tester’s seat in the Senate to Rosendale.", Montana Libertarian candidate walks back endorsement of GOP nominee Rosendale in tight Senate race ,11-2018
"Democrats will take control of the House of Representatives for the first time in eight years, Fox News projects, and the GOP will retain its majority in the Senate, following Texas Republican incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz`s defeat of insurgent challenger Rep. Beto O’Rourke in the most expensive Senate race in American history.

While Democrats` win in the House deals a major setback to President Trump’s legislative agenda and gives fresh hope to liberals who want to investigate and perhaps even impeach the president, the GOP`s hold on the Senate gives them control over all critical federal judicial appointments.

Although the exact size of the parties` respective majorities in the House and Senate are not clear, Democrats will soon have to decide whether to restore Nancy Pelosi to her old job as speaker of the House, which she held from 2007 to 2011.

""I do think that when you’re in the arena and somebody throws a punch, you better able to take a punch and throw a punch,"" Pelosi said this week, previewing the adversarial approach she would bring to the speakership.

Pelosi and top Democrats have vowed to open a series of investigations into the White House upon reclaiming the House, including probes into Trump`s unreleased personal tax returns, alleged collusion with Russia, and potential ethics violations by administration officials.

Prominent firebrands including Democratic Reps. Maxine Waters, Adam Schiff, and Jerry Nadler are slated to be elevated to lead the House Financial Services Committee, Intelligence Committee, and Judiciary Committee, respectively. With control of those and other key committees, Democrats will have the legal authority to issue subpoenas to compel Republicans and others to provide documents or appear at hearings -- and to seek contempt proceedings if they don`t comply.

""We will be able to get answers the Republicans were unwilling to pursue,"" Schiff told CNN in October. ""Records that the Republicans wouldn`t ask for."" (Pelosi has said that trying to obtain Trump`s tax returns would be ""one of the first things we`d do."")

Schiff added that he would place a ""very high priority"" on determining whether the Trump Organization had laundered money through Russia.

""You better able to take a punch and throw a punch."" — House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

Republicans, meanwhile, defied expectations of a blue wave on the strength of several major wins in the Senate. The Fox News Decision Desk projects that Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer will unseat one-term Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota, scoring a crucial Senate pickup for the GOP. Heitkamp, who had long struggled against Cramer in the reliably red state, may have sealed her political fate last month when she voted against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

In Indiana, Republican businessman Mike Braun will defeat first-term Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, another Democrat whose vote against Kavanaugh proved costly. The race was one of the most closely fought races in the country, and Braun`s victory marks another big win for the GOP. Trump had aggressively campaigned for Braun in recent days.

FULL MIDTERM RESULTS

New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez will win re-election by defeating Republican businessman Bob Hugin, Fox News also projects. In another key race, the Fox News Decision Desk projects that Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn will defeat former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen to replace retiring GOP Sen. Bob Corker.

While Blackburn spent all summer trailing Bredesen in the polls, she closed the gap and took the lead about a month ago, despite a last-minute endorsement by pop star Taylor Swift for Bredesen. Menendez, meanwhile, never trailed Hugin despite being seen as potentially vulnerable due to his 2017 federal corruption trial.

The Fox News Decision Desk also projects that West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin will win re-election by defeating Republican Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Manchin was the only member of his party to vote to confirm Kavanaugh.

Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney will also defeat Democrat Jenny Wilson to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch, as expected. The former Massachusetts governor, previously a fierce Trump critic, secured his support after backing his presidency.

And the Fox News Decision Desk can now project that none of the four candidates in Mississippi`s special Senate election will win tonight because none garnered 50 percent of the vote. The top two finishers – Republican incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democratic challenger Mike Espy -- will face each other in a runoff election on Nov. 27.

A number of other key races remain too close to call, including the contest between Montana incumbent Sen. Jon Tester and Republican challenger Matt Rosendale, the state auditor. President Trump has made it his mission to defeat Tester, who helped torpedo Trump’s nomination of White House physician Ronny Jackson to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. At this moment, Tester has a lead in this race.

In Nevada, Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen has a slight lead over incumbent Republican Sen. Dean Heller, but it’s too early to declare a winner in that race.

The Fox News Decision Desk also cannot yet project a winner in Arizona, where Republican Rep. Martha McSally is in a tight battle with Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake.

Democrats were able to regain the majority in the House by flipping key seats; they needed to take 23 for a majority. In Northern Virginia`s 10th Congressional District, GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock is projected to lose to her Democratic challenger, state Sen. Jennifer Wexton. Comstock was widely seen as one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress.

And 77-year-old Democrat Donna Shalala, who served as Secretary of Health and Human Services under President Bill Clinton, has defeated Republican opponent Maria Elvira Salazar in Florida`s 27th Congressional District, which has long been held by the GOP.

But two major Democratic efforts to flip Republican-controlled seats have come up short. In Kentucky`s 6th Congressional District, Republican incumbent Rep. Andy Barr has defeated Democrat Amy McGrath. The two had been competing in a neck-and-neck race, which Democrats saw as an opportunity to flip a seat in a GOP-leaning district. McGrath, the first female Marine to fly an F/A-18 on a combat mission, campaigned on a largely anti-Trump platform.

And Republican Denver Riggleman has defeated Democrat Leslie Cockburn to keep a closely watched Virginia congressional seat in the hands of the GOP. Virginia`s 5th Congressional District is home to incumbent GOP Rep. Tom Garrett, who announced that he would not seek re-election earlier this year amid mounting scandals. While the district supported President Trump in 2016 by double-digits, the contest had been tight between Cockburn, a former journalist who favors Medicare-for-all, and Riggleman, a staunch Republican.

Still, although voters in more than half of the 50 states have now locked in their ballots, the results of some of the most closely watched and consequential Senate and House contests in the midterms are still undetermined as Democrats look for signs of the blue wave they have predicted in recent days.

The Missouri contest between Democratic incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill and Republican challenger Josh Hawley, the state’s attorney general, is among those too close to project a winner, according to the Fox News Decision Desk. McCaskill said on Monday she doesn`t ""really care"" if Democrats retake the Senate, in an apparent effort to appeal to moderate voters in a state Trump carried by double digits in 2016.

Meanwhile, the Fox News Decision Desk projects that Democratic Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine will win a second term tonight by beating Republican challenger Corey Stewart. And Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who identifies as a democratic socialist, will easily win a third term by defeating Republican Lawrence Zupan.

And Democratic Sen.Elizabeth Warren will win a second term in Massachusetts, although she is already considering a presidential run in 2020. Warren defeated Republican Geoff Diehl, a state lawmaker. In another expected result, the Fox News Decision Desk can project that incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown will win a third term by defeating Republican Rep. Jim Renacci.

""Everything we have achieved is at stake,"" Trump, who announced that he will watch the election returns at the White House with family and friends, declared on Monday. Trump has openly characterized the first nationwide election since his rise to the presidency as a referendum on his tenure, which has seen significant economic growth and a rise in partisanship.

WATCH: COMSTOCK SAYS THREAT TO IMPEACH KAVANAUGH IS `RIDICULOUS`

Democrat and former CIA officer Abigail Spanberger also is challenging Tea Party-affiliated Republican Rep. Dave Brat, who has represented the state`s 7th Congressional District since 2014, when he stunned the nation by unseating then-House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor. Trump also carried this district by 7 points in 2016, and it has had a Republican representative for almost 50 years. But changing demographics have put it in play, analysts say.

On the gubernatorial side, Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum could make history as Florida`s first black governor if he defeats Republican Ron DeSantis to replace Scott, who is term-limited. Gillum supports Medicare-for-all and abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, and he has the backing of liberal megadonors like billionaire Tom Steyer in his bid to shift the state dramatically to the left. His agenda contrasts sharply with DeSantis, a hard-line Republican who cut an advertisement in which he teaches his child to ""build the wall"" with toy blocks.

The race is currently too close to call.

And in Georgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams could also make history as the country`s first black female governor. She is facing off against Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, whose hard-line voter registration policies have drawn rebukes from civil-rights groups and a federal judge, and Libertarian Party nominee Ted Metz. Kemp announced that his office was investigating ""possible cyber crimes"" by the Georgia Democratic Party on Sunday, throwing a last-minute wildcard into the race. It is too early to call that race.

Depending on Tuesday`s vote totals, Georgia may not have a governor-elect for several more weeks. Under Georgia law, if no single gubernatorial candidate gains at least 50 percent of the vote, a Dec. 4 runoff will be scheduled.

"With midterm election night mostly over in several states across the U.S., there are still several races that have yet to be called Wednesday.

Votes still need to be counted in at least two hotly contested Senate races and the contentious race for Georgia governor.

Take a look below at some of the major races that still need to be called.

ARIZONA SENATE RACE

The historic race between Republican Rep. Martha McSally and Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema is still too close to call. The two female lawmakers are vying in state that has never elected a woman to the Senate before.

A staffer for McSally’s campaign told Fox News they are “feeling good” about their chances as they watched other aces come in around the country.

The seat was left open after Sen. Jeff Flake, a Republican openly critical of Trump, announced his retirement. He had said he couldn’t win a GOP primary in the current political climate.

Ahead of the election, Fox News ranked the race as one of five toss-ups for the Senate. President Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton in Arizona by about 4 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election.

Polls closed in Arizona Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET.

MONTANA SENATE RACE

The race between Democratic incumbent Jon Tester and Republican Matt Rosendale was still close to call. Tester was seeking a third team against Rosendale, who is Montana’s auditor.

Trump has weighed in heavily in the race, backing Rosendale. He made four trips to the state to campaign for Rosendale and blamed Tester for derailing the nomination of White House doctor Ronny Jackson to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Tester has continued to highlight his life as a grain farmer and even the three fingers he lost in a meat grinder as a child. The approach had worked for him in the 2006 and 2012 elections.

The polls in Montana closed at 10 p.m. ET.

GEORGIA GUBERNATORIAL RACE

The contentious race for Georgia governor between Republican Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams were still battling to the last minute. The races were still deemed too close to call with 97 percent of the votes in and a 75,000 vote difference between Kemp and Abrams, according to Fox News’ projections.

Kemp and Abrams are aiming to replace term-limited GOP Gov. Nathan Deal, and hoping to escape a potential overtime run.

If neither candidate earns more than 50 percent of the vote, then they will head for a Dec. 4 runoff — the first general election gubernatorial runoff in the state’s history.

Abrams refused to concede to Kemp, saying her victory was still “within reach.”

“Tonight we have closed a gap between yesterday and tomorrow, but we still have a few more miles to go,” she said. “Across our state, folks are opening up the dreams of voters in absentee ballots, and we believe our chance for a stronger Georgia is just within reach.

CALIFORNIA HOUSE RACE

The race between Democrat Rep. Harley Rouda and Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher was still yet to be called.

Rohrabacher, was looking for his 16th term, and took a hardline stance on immigration and getting a strong endorsement from Trump on Monday.

Rouda, a real-estate investor who previously called for President Trump`s impeachment and accused Rohrabacher of being a Trump ally out of touch with voters, has said they need more moderates in Congress.

The polls in California have closed and 100 percent of votes are in, according to the latest Fox News projections.

"New York Senator Chuck Schumer tweeted last week: “We have tremendous unity in our caucus. That unity has been our strength, and it will continue to be as strong as ever in the 116th Congress.”

Mr. Schumer knows better. Democrats are not unified at all, as the skirmishes over leadership positions in Congress have shown. Word has it that Mr. Schumer was reelected Minority Leader by acclamation, but that unanimous vote posed a problem for Kyrsten Sinema, newly elected Democrat senator from Arizona, who had promised to oppose him.

Forced to explain why she broke a campaign pledge, Ms. Sinema, who ran as a moderate in her reddish state, said, “Had there been a challenger for minority leader, I would have considered new leadership and a fresh perspective.”

Meanwhile, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is in the fight of her life to regain the Speaker’s gavel. Many still expect the unpopular representative from California to succeed, but the emergence in recent days of a possible rival – Ohio Representative Marcia Fudge – could give her opponents a boost. Up until now the dozen-plus Democrats who have openly contested her election have had no one to rally around. Now they do.

Skirmishes over leadership posts are nothing new, for either political party, but Democrats face more than power struggles. They face serious discord over policy, with the progressive left clearly at odds with establishment figures like Schumer and Pelosi, and with party members who represent red states.

In coming months Mr. Schumer and his counterpart in the House will play ringmasters to a slew of newly elected Democrats eager to challenge establishment liberals like himself. These disrupters, like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have already shown a lack of respect for the traditions and hierarchies of Congress. Moreover, they embrace policies anathema to mainstream voters who will likely determine the outcome of the 2020 elections.

Mr. Schumer is going to have his hands full.

Republican leaders in Congress, like House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, might be forgiven a moment of schadenfreude. They have frequently had trouble corralling their own disparate elements, like the Freedom Caucus in the House. The embarrassing failure to upend ObamaCare came down, ultimately, to fundamental disagreements about the role of government in providing health care.

By contrast, Democrats have, in recent years, mostly sung from the same songbook. That is about to change.

Consider the divide between Senator Jon Tester from Montana and the progressive Ms. Ocasio-Cortez.

On gun control: Ocasio-Cortez backs universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and, on her website says she “wants to require Congresspeople to take no money from the gun lobby or private equity companies that invest in the firearms industry.” Questionable syntax aside, Ms. Cortez essentially advocates abolishing the rights upheld by the Supreme Court in Citizens United v. FEC.

In this past cycle, there was no unifying theme for the Democrats other than disapproval of President Trump. That wasn’t strong enough to take the Senate this year, and it won’t be enough to win the White House in 2020.

Jon Tester has a different position on guns: he loves them. Campaigning in Montana, Tester touted his votes in support of the Second Amendment, and his opposition to banning high caliber weapons. He furthered his gun-toting credentials by bragging during his reelection run that he had shot hundreds of cows and hogs on his farm, and also gophers. Videos of the senator plugging docile farm animals have been circulating online.

On climate change: Ms. Ocasio-Cortez made headlines when, on her freshman orientation tour, she joined a sit-in in former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office demanding action to prevent climate change. More recently the New York progressive advocated for a sweeping Green New Deal, under which 100 percent of U.S. power generation would come from renewable sources, in ten years. The “deal” also requires total “decarbonization” of the manufacturing, agricultural and other industries as well as of transportation and other infrastructure.

Jon Tester, hailing from the state with the nation’s largest coal reserves, as well as substantial oil and natural gas production, supports an “energy economy powered by Montana commonsense,” as he states on his website. In 2016 he introduced legislation to expand carbon capture tax credits, which provides tax credits to coal power producers and companies that capture carbon dioxide from their units. At the time he noted, ""Coal plays a pivotal role in Montana`s energy future. While some folks around the country are turning their backs on coal, I am pushing to expand the Carbon Capture Tax Credit to provide coal country with more financial certainty and encourage American innovation and investments in clean coal technology.""

On health care: The New York freshman advocates Medicare for All, and “people-centered” health care, as opposed to health care centered on, for instance, forest creatures. She says on her website that her proposal will drive down costs “by allowing all people in the US to buy into a universal healthcare system.” In interviews, she has repeatedly deflected questions about who will pick up the estimated $33 trillion tab for such an adventure.

A year ago, when Bernie Sanders introduced his “Medicare for All” bill, Jon Tester opposed it. He said at the time, “I support fixing what we got because I think that’s more likely to happen.” Tester voted for and supports ObamaCare, even though he admits that “there were plenty of mistakes” made with the bill, and even though premiums have increased in his state by 133 percent between 2013 and 2017.

Tester and Ocasio-Cortez may represent the outer fringes of Democrat opinion, but there are plenty who fall nearby, on both ends. Tensions will mount as party leaders try to reward the voters who gave them the majority in the House by writing and passing legislation; there will be winners and losers.

In that process, party leaders will hope to mold a coherent platform for 2020; it won’t be easy. Not easy, but necessary. In this past cycle, there was no unifying theme other than disapproval of President Trump.

On climate change: Ms. Ocasio-Cortez made headlines when, on her freshman orientation tour, she joined a sit-in in former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office demanding action to prevent climate change. More recently the New York progressive advocated for a sweeping Green New Deal, under which 100 percent of U.S. power generation would come from renewable sources, in ten years. The “deal” also requires total “decarbonization” of the manufacturing, agricultural and other industries as well as of transportation and other infrastructure.

Jon Tester, hailing from the state with the nation’s largest coal reserves, as well as substantial oil and natural gas production, supports an “energy economy powered by Montana commonsense,” as he states on his website. In 2016 he introduced legislation to expand carbon capture tax credits, which provides tax credits to coal power producers and companies that capture carbon dioxide from their units. At the time he noted, ""Coal plays a pivotal role in Montana`s energy future. While some folks around the country are turning their backs on coal, I am pushing to expand the Carbon Capture Tax Credit to provide coal country with more financial certainty and encourage American innovation and investments in clean coal technology.""

On health care: The New York freshman advocates Medicare for All, and “people-centered” health care, as opposed to health care centered on, for instance, forest creatures. She says on her website that her proposal will drive down costs “by allowing all people in the US to buy into a universal healthcare system.” In interviews, she has repeatedly deflected questions about who will pick up the estimated $33 trillion tab for such an adventure.

A year ago, when Bernie Sanders introduced his “Medicare for All” bill, Jon Tester opposed it. He said at the time, “I support fixing what we got because I think that’s more likely to happen.” Tester voted for and supports ObamaCare, even though he admits that “there were plenty of mistakes” made with the bill, and even though premiums have increased in his state by 133 percent between 2013 and 2017.

Tester and Ocasio-Cortez may represent the outer fringes of Democrat opinion, but there are plenty who fall nearby, on both ends. Tensions will mount as party leaders try to reward the voters who gave them the majority in the House by writing and passing legislation; there will be winners and losers.

In that process, party leaders will hope to mold a coherent platform for 2020; it won’t be easy. Not easy, but necessary. In this past cycle, there was no unifying theme other than disapproval of President Trump. That wasn’t strong enough to take the Senate this year, and it won’t be enough to win the White House in 2020.", Liz Peek: Democrats are in disarray. Does that spell trouble for 2020? ,11-2018
"The historic partisan rancor surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh could wind up helping Republicans keep control of the Senate in November, new polls and on-the-ground data suggest, as the controversy appears to galvanize conservative voters.

Political headwinds normally work against the party of incumbent presidents in their first midterm elections. According to an analysis by former George W. Bush administration official Bruce Mehlman, in the past 11 such midterm seasons, new presidents saw their party make net gains only once in the House, four times in the Senate and zero times in state gubernatorial contests.

But a new round of Fox News battleground polls, released Wednesday, suggests the 2018 midterms might buck that trend -- at least in the Senate, where the 35 seats up for election largely are in GOP-leaning states.

The surveys show a noticable uptick in Republican enthusiasm across the board in the past several weeks, concurrent with the increasingly heated confrontation between both parties over Kavanaugh`s confirmation and the sexual misconduct allegations leveled against him. The Senate is viewing the supplemental background investigation on those claims Thursday. While Democrats have complained about that process, sources say the review did not corroborate the allegations; a confirmation vote is expected as early as this weekend.

READ THE FULL RESULTS OF THE FOX NEWS SENATE POLLS

Amid that showdown, President Trump has drawn attention to polls suggesting the GOP base is fired up.

""The harsh and unfair treatment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh is having an incredible upward impact on voters,"" he tweeted Thursday.

On the heels of the Fox News polls, he also tweeted: ""Wow, such enthusiasm and energy for Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Look at the Energy, look at the Polls. Something very big is happening.""

Democrats, likewise, are working to fire up their own party over the Kavanaugh clash, arguing that Republicans from Trump on down have disrespected accuser Christine Blasey Ford and others by questioning their accounts. Their concerns tap into the powerful #MeToo movement, which could still result in a backlash for GOP candidates in House races in swing districts.

""The fight over Judge Kavanaugh is increasing base intensity for both parties, helping Democrats with white college-educated women in suburban House districts while bolstering Republicans among evangelical voters in the many rural red state Senate contests,"" Mehlman told Fox News. He recently authorized an analysis outlining how some other major factors, including the economy and record-high levels of spending, are will impact the upcoming vote.

But Republicans are fighting on already-favorable turf in Senate races. And the Fox News polling shows an overall surge in GOP voter enthusiasm. Compared with early September, the number of Republicans feeling “extremely” interested in the upcoming election is up by 2 points in Arizona, up by 9 points in Indiana, up 8 points in both Missouri and North Dakota, and up 11 points in Tennessee. In each state, Republicans are now just as likely as Democrats to say they are extremely interested -- erasing an edge Democrats had in several states last month.

Voter interest is directly linked to turnout, which Republican leaders feared would be so low as to offset some of the inherent advantages they have this year in the Senate. Only nine GOP-controlled seats there are up for grabs in 2018, compared with a whopping 26 for Democrats -- and some of those Democrat-controlled seats are in states that went by wide margins for Trump in 2016, including North Dakota, Missouri and Indiana.

At a rally Tuesday in Montana, Vice President Mike Pence`s vocal support of Kavanaugh got a bigger rise out of the crowd than anything he said about tax reform, ObamaCare or even 2016’s most reliable rallying cry – a promise to build a border wall.

“You know, Judge Brett Kavanaugh is a man of integrity with impeccable credentials,” Pence said, to uproarious cheers and applause, at the end of a riff about other conservative judges Trump has nominated.

“I think what it’s done is basically galvanize, certainly, the Republican voters,” said Montana Republican Senate candidate Matt Rosendale, who is hammering his opponent, Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., for his pledge to vote “no” on the nominee.

Voters also appeared particularly energized in Missouri, which Fox News polls show is tied up at 43 percent apiece for incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill and Republican challenger Josh Hawley. Just three weeks ago, McCaskill was up 44-41 percent. Last week, even before California professor Christine Blasey Ford testified against Kavanaugh, McCaskill announced that she would not support the nominee.

ADVERTISING BACKFIRE: REPUBLICAN SENATOR ASKS MCCASKILL TO REMOVE HIM FROM TV SPOT TOUTING HER `BIPARTISAN` CREDENTIALS

That decision seems to be costing McCaskill some key support. Crucially, according to Fox News polling, among the 28 percent of voters who say they could still switch candidates, almost twice as many say McCaskill voting against Kavanaugh’s confirmation would make them less inclined to back her.

""The priority in Democratic infrastructure is to win the House."" — Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson

North Dakota shows an even clearer picture.

Vulnerable North Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who remains undecided on Kavanaugh, appeared to be treading carefully after McCaskill`s loss of support. Fox News` polling shows Republican challenger Kevin Cramer now leading by 12 points (53-41 percent). Last month, he was up by only 4 points (48-44 percent).

For their part, Democrats are also trying to leverage Kavanaugh to boost their base. In a fiery speech outside the Supreme Court Wednesday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., likened Trump`s support for Kavanaugh to his outreach to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Pelosi, who had vowed to ""avenge Obama"" by fighting Kavanaugh before his nomination was even announced, emphasized the importance of voters mobilizing to see results in Washington.

Analysts and polling suggest that Democrats, despite the upsurge in Republican enthusiasm, still have good odds to retake the House in November, where all of the seats are up for grabs.

“Our guys are taking a beating,” GOP consultant Rob Simms told The Washington Examiner on Tuesday, saying that House Republican candidates are being badly outspent by well-funded Democratic groups.

A new poll from Quinnipiac University showed that 49 percent of voters preferred that the Democrats take back Congress, compared with 42 percent for Republicans.

“For the first cycle in a decade, the priority in Democratic infrastructure is to win the House,” Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson told the Examiner. “The Trump administration is fueling the desire of Democrats to win the House so that we have at least one arm of government.”

"In assessing who comes out ahead or behind after the Kavanaugh firestorm, let’s acknowledge that in some ways we don’t know: the midterm elections a month from now have become more chaotic and uncertain as the Kavanaugh hearing has added fuel to the already raging partisan flames.

The election impact may be a split outcome. In four states where Democratic Senators are running for re-election, Trump and his Supreme Court pick are popular. Senators Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Jon Tester of Montana may go down to defeat because the intensity of their liberal base’s opposition prevented them from moving to the center and voting for Kavanaugh. Last year, both Donnelly and Heitkamp, for example, voted for Neil Gorsuch, Trump’s first Supreme Court choice.

For his part, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell thinks the excesses of the Kavanaugh opposition are a “great political gift.” He told The Hill newspaper on Saturday that “The tactics have energized our base. I want to thank the mob, because they’ve done the one thing we were having trouble doing, which was energizing our base.”

But there is a flip side of the political impact. The confirmation of Kavanaugh could inflame suburban women, who will play a key role in deciding whether or not the GOP can defend 25 seats won by Hillary Clinton in 2016. Take Southern California, where Democrats are currently leading or tied in four Orange County districts Clinton carried but which also elected a Republican in 2016.

A Democratic poll released Wednesday found that women in the four Orange County seats said they would be less likely to vote Republican if Kavanaugh was confirmed.

While there is a lot that’s uncertain about the Kavanaugh fallout, we can draw some conclusions on who winners or losers are:

Winners:

The Rule of Law

Bedrock principles of American justice, such as the presumption of innocence and a rejection of mob rule, were upheld - albeit narrowly. Senator Lindsey Graham’s fears that smears and character assassination would dominate any future court appointment debate have been put in abeyance for now. A new version of Congressional McCarthyism didn’t succeed. But as John Nolte of Breitbart.com noted: “Not a single Democrat or member of the establishment media had the moral courage to be the Joseph Welch of their time, to point to their own and ask, “Have you no sense of decency?”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other conservatives are full of praise for McConnell, R-Ky., with Gingrich tweeting: “The successful approval of Judge Kavanaugh owes a lot to Mitch McConnell’s skill, determination and leadership. The Senate leader’s effectiveness is changing the trajectory of U.S. history.”

McConnell pulled off an encore performance with the Kavanaugh fight. In 2016 he held his caucus together and kept the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia open until after that year’s November election. This year, he dismissed calls for Kavanaugh’s nomination to be withdrawn and fulfilled his promise to “plow ahead” and confirm Kavanaugh in the absence of any corroborating evidence that the nominee was a sexual assailant.

President Trump

Donald Trump won in 2016 in part because he convinced wobbly Republicans spooked by the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape that he would appoint solid conservatives to the federal courts. He has proceeded to do precisely that with his two additions to the Supreme Court and dozens of appointees to lower courts.

He also has convinced Republicans that they have a common adversary in the left, and that should override concerns about his erratic governing style. “This is the first time the country club Republican and the Trump Republican has come together,” Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina says.

Even virulently “Never Trump” columnist Bret Stephens of the New York Times wrote: “I’ll admit to feeling grateful that, in Trump, at least one big bully was willing to stand up to others.”

Jeff Flake

The Arizona senator doesn’t have to worry about the immediate political implications of his role in the Kavanaugh battle. He is retiring this year.

But despite some ridicule and anger, it appears he will emerge with more pluses than minuses. His insistence that the FBI’s background check be reopened for one week paid off.

It allowed additional time for the less credible allegations against Kavanaugh to collapse. It produced no new incriminating evidence against him. Indeed, it turned up evidence that Christine Ford’s allies had unsuccessfully pressured Leland Keyser, a key witness, to change her story and corroborate Ford’s account of sexual assault.

Flake is known to be considering a primary challenge to President Trump in 2020. His stance in the Kavanaugh confirmation battle means he will run away with the “media primary” over who gets the most attention in any challenge to Trump. But, on the other hand, Trump’s success in winning the confirmation battle has united the Republican Party behind the president - at least until the November midterm election results are known.

And here are the losers:

Michael Avenatti

The publicity-seeking lawyer who represents Stormy Daniels, the adult film actress who claims she had an affair with Donald Trump, couldn’t resist jumping into the Kavanaugh fight. He wound up being blamed by many Democrats for helping them lose momentum and making opposition to Kavanaugh appear to be part of a partisan pile on.

Avenatti was the lawyer for Julie Swetnick, who claimed she saw a young Kavanaugh at multiple parties where “gang rapes” occurred. But Swetnick’s credibility came under intense fire and she was caught in inconsistencies on key elements of her story. Senator Susan Collins of Maine called the claims “outlandish” and cited them as one of the reasons she voted to confirm Kavanaugh.

FBI

The law enforcement agency is under attack now from both the right and the left.

It had already faced skepticism from conservatives for the alleged role several FBI officials played in the 2016 investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails and the later decision to investigate possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. A poll by NPR, PBS NewsHour and Marist College found that nearly a third of those surveyed found the FBI to be biased against Trump.

Democrats now complain the FBI bungled its initial background checks of Kavanaugh and then, when they were asked to reopen them, the bureau bowed to White House pressure to make them narrow and prefunctory.

Senate moderates

It’s unclear what the fallout will be on two key Senators who decided Kavanaugh’s fate. But it’s certainly true that neither of them welcomed the intense scrutiny and publicity they garnered in recent weeks.

Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine is now a hero to conservatives, an unusual position for someone who cast a key vote against repeal of ObamaCare last year. She will need that support in 2020 if she chooses to seek re-election. A liberal group has already raised over $3 million to support whichever Democrat decides to challenge Collins.

Change Research, a Democratic polling firm, found that 50 percent of voters are now less likely to support Collins because of her vote for confirmation. But memories do fade in politics. After Anita Hill’s testimony against Clarence Thomas, feminist groups proclaimed 1992 was the “Year of the Woman” and vowed to defeat Senators who had supported Thomas. But, with the exception of Democrat Alan Dixon who faced a primary only five months after the Hill controversy, no supporter of Thomas lost. Indeed, Republicans actually gained a Senate seat and nine House seats in the “Year of the Woman.”

Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was the sole Republican to vote against Kavanaugh, and her vote infuriated conservatives who vowed to defeat her in the 2022 Republican primary. Former GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin tweeted out “Hey @LisaMurkowski - I can see 2022 from my house.”

But Murkowski has faced angry conservatives before. She actually lost the 2010 GOP primary, but bounced back and won re-election as a write-in that fall. She could repeat that feat again, switch parties and become a Democrat, or run as an independent.

Feminist groups

The protestors who screamed and shrieked from the Senate gallery as Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed didn’t do their cause any favors. Nor did leaders of the Women’s March, who lashed out at Senator Susan Collins as a “rape apologist.”

Several senators accused the activists of trying to “intimidate” them into opposing the nominee through such tactics as driving Senator Ted Cruz and his wife out of a Washington restaurant.

The media

The mainstream media already had credibility problems before the Kavanaugh hearings. They were made worse by many reporters who credulously reported the accusations of Christine Ford and others without properly scrutinizing them. Some of the commentary was vile, such as suggestions Kavanaugh should no longer coach girl’s basketball teams regardless of his guilt or innocence. A cartoonist mocked Kavanaugh’s 10-year-old daughter for praying for Ford.

The country

Finally, it can be fairly said the nation wasn’t helped by the deeply partisan and ideological divides that were further exposed by the Kavanaugh hearings.

Relations between men and women are now even more fraught with tension and suspicion after a year of the #MeToo movement. Many Americans might now think women are less likely to be believed if they come forward with accounts of sexual assault, while others will fear that some men will be accused unfairly of false or exaggerated incidents in cases where the truth is unlikely to be ever firmly established.

And it’s also clear that the U.S. Senate, once touted as the world’s greatest deliberative body, is now seen as something more resembling a mosh pit of partisan grievances.

As for the Supreme Court, the Kavanaugh debate has brought to light just how much it’s viewed by both parties in this country as a political player in key issues that used to be decided by legislative bodies. The branch of government our Founding Fathers viewed as “the least dangerous branch” has clearly become an unelected power center that has the final say in too many of our great national debates.", John Fund: Winners and losers in the Kavanaugh confirmation fight ,10-2018
"Democrats are outraising Republicans in this year`s tight Senate races. Their secret: out-of-state donors.

The cash flood underscores how key races have become nationalized – influenced not only by President Trump or Nancy Pelosi, but by big political investments from well-heeled donors in Manhattan and Silicon Valley.

In Nevada, the numbers are most stark: While Republican incumbent Sen. Dean Heller has raised more than twice as much money from Nevadans as Democratic rival Jacky Rosen, she more than made up for it outside the state.

More than 85 percent of Rosen’s donations come from out-of-staters, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, compared with 59 percent for Heller.

Thanks to the outside money, Rosen beats Heller in total fundraising by more than a million dollars.

The Heller campaign, in turn, has accused Rosen of being funded by liberal-state interests.

“Jacky Rosen’s campaign is fueled and propped up by millions of dollars from California and New York,” campaign spokesman Keith Schipper told Fox News. “She is bought and paid for by the progressive elites who know they can count on her to be a reliable vote.”

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Rosen`s top-five donor zip codes are:

10023 (New York, N.Y.) $127,757

20815 (Chevy Chase, Md.) $121,542

10024 (New York) $119,611

94301 (Palo Alto, Calif.) $86,591

94027 (Atherton, Calif.) $80,138

Heller`s top-five donation sources are:

89135 (Las Vegas, Nev.) $255,845

89511 (Reno, Nev.) $182,820

89134 (Las Vegas) $115,076

89052 (Henderson, Nev.) $111,943

89509 (Reno) $110,883

That doesn’t include money from outside groups, which also favor the Democrat by $23 million to $15 million, according to The Campaign Finance Institute.

Rosen’s campaign did not respond to a call and email for comment. But campaign finance experts suggested the out-of-state donations merely speak to the significance of this year’s midterms.

“It`s not about coastal elites. That`s a caricature,” Michael Malbin, director of The Campaign Finance Institute, told Fox News. “It’s because donors all over country understand that control of the whole Senate chamber is at stake.”

Another big reason: The rise of a Democratic fundraising tool called “ActBlue,” which facilitated more than $1 billion in donations to Democrats this election cycle.

“ActBlue has created a vehicle that allows people to give even to candidates they know very little about. The GOP has not been able to create anything like that,” Malbin said.

The donations coming through ActBlue are often small-dollar donations. So Rosen gets a greater proportion of her funds from small donors than Heller does.

Nevada is hardly the only place getting political money from all over the country.

In every state rated a “toss up” by the Fox News Senate Power Rankings, the Democrat received more donations, including more out-of-state donations. The five toss-up states are Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Missouri, and Nevada.

In all but one toss-up – Missouri – the Democrat also received more funding from outside groups, according to data from The Campaign Finance Institute.

The groups range from the pro-choice Emily’s List to Giffords PAC, a Bloomberg-funded group backing candidates that support gun control, to the NRA.

All sources combined, Democrats have a money lead in Arizona, Indiana and Nevada (where the nominees are Kyrsten Sinema, Joe Donnelly and Rosen, respectively), but not in Missouri.

In Florida, while Democrats have the edge in fundraising, Republican candidate and Gov. Rick Scott (a former businessman) put up $38 million of his own money to flip the tables.

The fundraising trend goes beyond toss-up states. In Montana, more than twice as much money went toward Democratic Sen. Jon Tester than his Republican rival Matt Rosendale. The state is currently ranked as lean Democrat.

In Texas, more money went to Democrat Beto O’Rourke than Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, even as Cruz leads in the polls. Tennessee is the odd state out, as the money slightly favors Republican Marsha Blackburn. She also leads in the polls.

Some who study the political process say out-of-state contributions are understandable.

“I`m a big proponent of allowing this money to flow across borders,” Mark Crain, an economics professor at Lafayette College, told Fox News.

“The politician that has the biggest influence on your life is probably not the politician elected in your district.”

Asked if local voters might see that as outsiders trying to meddle, Crain said politicians would need to weigh that problem and could even reject the money.

Fundraising does not always determine winners. In 2016, the Clinton campaign and outside supporters out-raised Trump’s campaign and backers by nearly 2-to-1, yet lost.

In Nevada, Heller’s campaign spokesman says he’s confident outside money won’t sway the election.

“The amount of money they are pouring in to buy this U.S. Senate seat is unprecedented,” Schipper said. “But make no mistake, this is Nevada’s seat and it’s not for sale.”

"President Trump hosted his third wide-ranging rally of the midterm season in Montana on Thursday night, where he urged voters to ""never forget Benghazi"" and praised Republican Rep. Greg Gianforte, who pleaded guilty to body slamming a reporter last year, as a ""tough cookie.""

Only three other sitting presidents have ever visited Missoula, where between 6,000 and 8,000 people were attending the event at the Minuteman Aviation hangar, according to The Misssoulian.

""I love these hangars,"" Trump said at the opening of the rally, as the crowd chanted ""USA!"" He continued: ""I love a hangar. There`s nothing like a hangar. You get out of the plane, you walk over, and you have massive crowds."" Later, Trump remarked repeatedly that he was underneath a ""beautiful, beautiful, big sky.""

He quickly turned to Gianforte, advising the crowd: ""Never wrestle him. Any guy that can do a body slam, he`s my kind of guy.""

Gianforte, who is running against Democrat Kathleen Williams, was required to undergo anger management classes for pummeling Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs the day before his election. He was sentenced to community service and fined $385 last year.

""Never wrestle him. Any guy that can do a body slam, he`s my kind of guy."" — President Trump on Rep. Greg Gianforte

Trump continued: ""I shouldn`t say this -- it`s nothing to be embarrassed about. I was in Rome with a lot of the leaders of other countries ... and I heard about it, and we endorsed Greg very early, but I had heard that he had body slammed a reporter. And he was way up, and I said, and this was the day of the election or just before -- `This is terrible, he`s going to lose the election.` And then I said, `Wait a minute, I know Montana pretty well. I think it might help him.` And it did. He`s a great guy. Tough cookie.""

The president also took aim at his opponent in the 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton, criticizing her for her email practices and telling the crowd to ""Never Forget Benghazi.""

His comments came days after a federal judge excoriated the State Department for ""lying"" by presenting the court with ""clearly false"" affidavits documenting their review of Clinton`s emails and communications concerning the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

A State Department lawyer acknowledged that the government`s review of the materials could be considered inadequate.

`SHOCKED`, `DUMBFOUNDED` FEDERAL JUDGE UNLOADS ON STATE DEPARTMENT LAWYER OVER CLINTON PROBE `LIE`

With just weeks until the pivotal midterm elections, the president was primarily seeking to convince Montana to replace his longtime bitter rival, incumbent Sen. Democratic Jon Tester, with GOP state auditor Matt Rosendale. But his rally was also part of his long-running effort to help preserve Republicans` tenuous holds on the Senate and House of Representatives.

""This will be an election of Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order, and common sense,"" Trump said, referring to his successful Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh and a Central American migrant caravan approaching the U.S. border with Mexico.

U.S. and Mexican officials have agreed on a plan to handle the caravan, a senior administration official told Fox News on Thursday.

""I just want to thank the Mexican government because they`re stopping it hopefully before it even gets to Mexico,"" Trump said to applause. ""As you know, I`m willing to send the military to defend our southern border if necessary, all caused by the illegal immigration onslaught brought by the Democrats because they refuse to acknowledge or change the laws. And they figure everyone who`s coming in is going to vote Democrat.""

""I have caused the problem,"" Trump went on. ""Because I have created such an incredible economy, I have created so many jobs. I have made this country, with you, so great, that everybody wants to come in. So they`re all pouring in -- or trying to.""

Losing one or both chambers in November`s midterm elections, Trump himself has warned, could not only compromise border security and complicate his legislative agenda -- which top Republicans recently said might include another attempt at fully repealing ObamaCare -- but also empower Democrats to open a series of investigations and potentially even impeachment proceedings.

Trump emphasized that possibility in a previous rally in Montana just last month.

""I don`t even bring it up,"" Trump told the crowd. ""Because I view it as something that, you know, they like to use the impeach word. Impeach Trump. Maxine Waters, `We will impeach him.` But he didn`t do anything wrong. `It doesn`t matter, we will impeach him. We will impeach.` But I say, how do you impeach somebody that`s doing a great job that hasn`t done anything wrong?""

DEMS POISED TO MAKE HISTORIC IMPEACHMENT PUSH AFTER MIDTERMS

Fox News currently rates the Senate race in Montana, a state Trump won over Hillary Clinton by double digits in 2016, as lean Democrat -- and in the final weeks of the campaign season, there are renewed signs that Trump has made it his personal mission to push the state back into the Republicans` column.

Earlier this year, Trump called for Tester’s resignation for his role in torpedoing Dr. Ronny Jackson`s nomination to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Jackson had been besieged by unproven and disputed allegations compiled by Tester’s office concerning his prescription-drug practices and use of alcohol. (Tester is the top Democrat on the Republican-controlled Senate Veteran Affairs Committee.)

The president repeated that line of attack this week, saying that Tester had treated Jackson more unfairly than Democrats who fiercely opposed Kavanaugh`s nomination. Democrats promoted a series of uncorroborated sexual misconduct and rape accusations against the then-nominee.

""Ever since his vicious and totally false statements about Admiral Ron Jackson, the highly respected White House Doctor for Obama, Bush & me, Senator John Tester looks to be in big trouble in the Great State of Montana!"" Trump wrote on Twitter Wednesday. ""He behaved worse than the Democrat Mob did with Justice K!""

At Thursday`s rally, Trump simply called Tester ""disgraceful"" and accused him of leading a ""mob"" to unfairly destroy Jackson`s reputation.

JON TESTER CAMPAIGNS ON HUNTING, BUT HASN`T HAD HUNTING LICENSE IN SIX YEARS

""Tester said things about him that were a disgrace,"" Trump said, adding that ""a series of lies"" had ultimately derailed Jackson. He compared Jackson to Kavanaugh, saying both men were respected and had been wrongly maligned.

""The only thing keeping Tester`s campaign alive, are millions and millions and millions of dollars from outside liberals and radical leftists who couldn`t care less about Montana,"" Trump said. He added that Tester opposed his tax bill and wants ""open borders.""

He added that his wife, First Lady Melania Trump, was ""so cool you wouldn`t believe it"" during a mid-flight scare this week, when smoke filled the cabin of her military jet.

Trump wrapped up the event by mocking Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren for ""making a fool out of herself"" by releasing the results of a disputed DNA test she claimed proved she likely had a recent Native American ancestor.

ANALYSIS: ELIZABETH WARREN`S DNA TEST IS A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL

""She has so little Indian blood -- she has none -- that I can no longer call her Pocahontas,"" Trump taunted.

Thursday`s rally comes two days after the Marine Corps veteran who served as Montana`s GOP chairman from 2009 to 2015 warned potential protesters on Facebook that Trump supporters tend to carry guns.

""All you protesters ... This is a concealed and open carry state, and we know how to use em."" — Fmr. Montana GOP chair Will Deschamps

“Also all you protesters, show up as well,"" the former state Republican chairman, Will Deschamps, wrote on the social media site. ""This is a concealed and open carry state and we know how to use em.""

He ended his message by noting that he is “USMC trained,” referring to his military service.

Trump has held more than two dozen rallies to benefit GOP candidates, and more than 350 rallies since beginning his presidential bid in 2015.

Trump`s campaign has said it is paying all the bills for the rallies, including the costs of fueling and using Air Force One to ferry the president and his staff to and from the events.

TUCKER CARLSON, HOST: Good evening and welcome to ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" and greetings from California. We`re coming to you live this evening from the Nixon Library in Yorba Linda outside Los Angeles.

We`ll see if you remember hearing this story at any point before. A Caravan of impoverished migrants is now making its way up from Central America through Mexico. Their plan is to present themselves at our Southern border and demand entry into our country with all the benefits, of course, that that entails.

The White House has vowed to stop this Caravan using the Armed Forces, if necessary, but it keeps coming. Have you heard something like that before? Well in fact, you have.

Something very similar happened just a few months ago. We watched another migrant Caravan snake its way up from Central America. It finally arrived and then the news coverage essentially stopped. But what happened next? Well here`s what happened next.

Hundreds of those people in that Caravan are still here in the U.S. And if recent history is any guide at all, very few of them will ever leave. Once you reach this country and claim asylum, you`re usually home free. Our media don`t often cover that. But the rest of the world is watching and knows it very well. And that`s why they keep coming.

The most recent estimates suggest that a caravan`s worth of uninvited migrants arrives at our border every few days. Why is this happening? Because an entire political party is inviting it and encouraging it. They believe unchecked immigration will strengthen their hold on power. They`re perfectly aware that you don`t like this, but they don`t care.

Just yesterday, Nancy Pelosi said it would be ""immoral"" to build a wall that might stop poor people from flooding into this country. Watch.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HOUSE MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: We have to do something other than building a wall, which you can`t try very well. In my view, it`s immoral, expensive, ineffective, and not something that people do between countries.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Did you catch that? Securing the border is just ""Not something people do,"" not something decent people do, anyway. Bigots do it, so do moral reprobates and anyone else who derives pleasure from cruelty.

As MSNBC explained just today, borders are a lot like slavery or the Trail of Tears. Watch:

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

STEPHEN EDWARD SCHMIDT, PUBLIC AFFAIRS STRATEGIST: This is a moral outrage that harkens to the worst accesses in the history of the country, to the separation of families at the slave auction blocks--

ROSEANNE O`DONNELL, COMEDIAN, ACTRESS, AUTHOR, TELEVISION PERSONALITY: Yes.

SCHMIDT: --to the separation of Native American families. It is a--

NICOLLE WALLACE, NBC NEWS: And - and as Laura said that--

SCHMIDT: --moral outrage.

O`DONNELL: I love you. I really do. I will make sure --

SCHMIDT: Me too Rosie.

O`DONNELL: --I`d like to move next door to you. We`ll have coffee --

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: They`re morally outraged. Well, they`re always morally outraged. And the point of their moral outrage is pretty clear. America has no right to decide who lives within its borders. Americans lack the moral standing to make that decision. We are too sinful.

Illegal immigrants come here because we deserve it. We meddled in their wars in the 1980s. We had the gall to get addicted to the drugs they send us. We once had segregation in the American South, whatever. The point is this is a fallen country. 22 million illegals within our borders is just the beginning of our penance. Latin America is listening to all of this and they are getting the message, and that`s why they`re on their way.

Last fiscal year, 94,000 families from the Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador were detained at the U.S. border. Not one of these people had a right to come in, but they were not deported. Almost 100 percent of them are still here and most will never leave. We are powerless in the face of this.

Congress could fix it but Congress refuses to fix it. The system is broken by design. Voters know this, of course. It`s one of the main reasons they voted for Donald Trump two years ago. They don`t hate immigrants, obviously, but they do believe America has a right to decide which immigrants to admit. All countries have that right, don`t they?

That would be an interesting debate. The Democratic Party and their lackeys in the media don`t want to have that debate because they know they would lose. So instead, they try to bully the population into silence.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)

CHRIS CUOMO, CNN: The GOP argument on immigration isn`t one that`s optimism-based, it`s fear-based.

DON LEMON, CNN: This is a scare tactic, right? This is the President - this immigration is a scare tactic he`s using to rev up his supporters.

EDDIE GLAUDE, CENTER FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES: When you talk about caravan, you`re talking about White anxiety. You`re talking about old White man angst. And so, when they bring up the caravan that`s all we need to do is to bring up the pictures of children being separated from their families.

(END VIDEO CLIPS)

CARLSON: In other words: shut up, racist. You probably heard that before too like every day for the last two years. You hear it a lot because it`s an effective political tactic. But it only works if you fall for it. You should not fall for it.

Most Americans are not racists, not even close. They`re decent people. They love their country. They want their country to continue. And they know that will not continue without real borders.

Max Burns is spokesman for Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, a groups that campaigns on behalf of migration, and he joins us tonight. Thanks a lot Max for joining us tonight. So, sort of a macro question first. You acknowledge this is a democracy. And - and democracies, over time, probably ought to reflect the will of the people who live within them.

The majority of the population overwhelmingly thinks Americans have the right to determine who comes in from other countries. We don`t have that right. It`s demonstrable. Isn`t this anti-democratic, the system that we have now?

MAX BURNS, ROBERT F. KENNEDY HUMAN RIGHTS: I don`t know that anyone`s arguing that we have to take people in. This is, Tucker, a - a simple question of enforcing the laws that we already have.

I mean if people like Barry Goldwater, and Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush could make the distinction between an immigrant and a refugee, I think it`s well within the capability of Congress and the President to make that same distinction today.

CARLSON: But we`re not making that distinction. And that`s the reason that of the last Caravan, as you just heard, which was several months ago, almost every single member who made it within our borders is still here.

We`re not enforcing our own laws, and that`s why we have upwards of 22 million illegal aliens within our borders. The outline`s really simple. We don`t have control of who`s coming in or out. And it`s hard to contest that when the numbers are universally acknowledged. So, why is that democratic if most people don`t want it?

BURNS: I think it`s strange that the people talking about law and order don`t want to enforce, say, the Refugee Act of 1980, which was unanimously passed by the Senate, unanimity not something we`re used to today, and who don`t want to follow the process that`s enshrined in our own domestic law to grant at least the application and the right to plead a case for asylum at the border. That`s in the law.

CARLSON: Right.

BURNS: The problem is that process is not--

CARLSON: Right--

BURNS: --being followed.

CARLSON: Well it`s not, as you know, and I think your argument is disingenuous, because you know, because you work on this issue that the overwhelming majority of people are released within our country and never go before a judge, and just stay here.

And again, that`s why we have 22 million, so when - illegals in this country right now. It`s part of the reason. So, if you see a migrant caravan coming of people who have no documentation and no right to be here, it`s a little concerning when the Left says ""Well, wait a second. We deserve them because we meddled in their countries in the 80s or we take the drugs they send us.""

BURNS: Well--

CARLSON: The point that you`re making--

BURNS: --come on, Tucker--

CARLSON: --and others on the Left are making is this is our punishment--

BURNS: No, come on, Tucker--

CARLSON: --which is what you clearly say --

BURNS: --you`re - you`re - you`re a supply and demand conservative. You know that there can`t be a demand without supply, there can`t be supply without demand. It`s not like this is a one-way street.

These are drugs that we are obsessed with as a nation due to a failed war on drugs, and there is something to be said for the fact that we have created this gang violence, this political instability in Honduras and Guatemala--

CARLSON: Oh, we`ve created it.

BURNS: --through this addiction we have to drugs and, yet, we are so hesitant to acknowledge--

CARLSON: So--

BURNS: --the human cost that`s marching toward us.

CARLSON: I guess I`m not hesitant to acknowledge the human cost. I`m struck by your hesitance to acknowledge the over 50,000 Americans who died last year of drug ODs. Where do they figure into this moral equation of yours where we deserve to be invaded because we take their drugs? What about the families of the 50,000 who died? How much time do you spend thinking about them?

BURNS: All the time. I think they would be much better served using that money we want to spend on a wall for opioid prevention, opioid education, and to rethink this entire country`s addiction to heroin, crystal meth--

CARLSON: It`s --

BURNS: --to marijuana--

CARLSON: Wait maybe --

BURNS: --come on, Tucker, that`s more useful--

CARLSON: --but - but - but - wait - wait - but wait --

BURNS: --than a wall.

CARLSON: --a wall might stem some of the flood of illegal drugs, not all, but some that would save American lives. But that`s not a concern to you because why?

BURNS: Because these people are seeking--

CARLSON: You`re against the wall because you believe it would work.

BURNS: --no, because the people in this caravan are seeking asylum status. They`re not drug runners. All the pictures that are up right now on the TV- -

CARLSON: But what about - but - but --

BURNS: --are them checking in at--

CARLSON: --well you don`t know - we don`t --

BURNS: --police stations.

CARLSON: --you don`t know - you don`t know who they are actually.

BURNS: The people--

CARLSON: You have no idea who they are and neither do I, so we know--

BURNS: Which is why we have a process for hearing their--

CARLSON: --what the press is telling us they are --

BURNS: --asylum claim. That`s why we have--

CARLSON: But the macro point is--

BURNS: --that in process.

CARLSON: --why do not - hold on, you know as well as I that a wall would give us some control, physical control over our borders. It works, which is why you hate it. Why would you argue against the right of a sovereign nation to determine who comes in? Why - what is your motive in that, honestly?

BURNS: I think the drugs, you would agree, are going in under the wall and over the wall and on sea routes, not so much through a point of entry like McAllen, Texas.

CARLSON: I`m not - I`m not sure we know that. But people are certainly going on foot and a wall would stop some of them. Why would you oppose that?

BURNS: There was a report on Fox just the other day of a gigantic air- conditioned drug tunnel with a little mini subway in it, so you can`t say that it`s not like--

CARLSON: Right, of course --

BURNS: --they haven`t figured out how to get around a wall.

CARLSON: Yes. So you`re just - you just want to save money. You just worry about federal expenditures. All right, we`re out of time. Max, thank you.

BURNS: Thank you.

CARLSON: Victor Davis Hanson is a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, also in California, and he joins us tonight. Professor, thank you very much for coming on. I`m fixated--

VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW: Thank you.

CARLSON: --on the moral argument here beneath the policy argument, which is that the United States has no moral standing. The Left is saying this blows, he said it, the guest who I just talked to has said it. We have no moral standing. We have no right to determine who comes into our country because our history is just so bad, so awful, so sinful. What do you make of that argument?

HANSON: Well - well I don`t really - I don`t even take it on its own merits because I don`t think they really believe in any consistency. Remember, it was just 30 years ago that the likes of Cesar, it - it - it was Cesar Chavez and Bill Clinton and Chuck Schumer - want to - to - I don`t have --

CARLSON: Who were making the--

HANSON: --they - they were--

CARLSON: --case. Right.

HANSON: --yes. They were all making the case - case that the borders should be poor - should be closed because it adversely impact the minority communities, and that it - it under writ - it undermined Union wages and entry-level workers.

And then when we got 20 million, all of a sudden they said ""Wow. We flipped California, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, this is a good thing. Let`s ignore federal immigration law.""

And then, same thing with sanctuary cities. They`re good now because that it - it fulfills a useful agenda. But believe me, if Alabama and Montana and Utah said ""You know what, in our jurisdictions, in our state, we don`t want to adhere to federal orders about gay marriage or the Endangered Species Act or federal handgun registration,"" then all of a sudden that would be nullification and Neo-Confederate in the eyes of the - the Left.

It`s the Kavanaugh hearings all over again. Remember, in a nanosecond we were going to throw out a 100 - 238 years of American jurisprudence because it didn`t coincide with an agenda for the Supreme Court.

And then afterwards, suddenly the good blue wall Electoral College that helped Obama get elected was - had to be jettisoned because it - it crumbled and gave Trump the election. And Senators were wonderful from small states, the same as big states--

CARLSON: Yes.

HANSON: --because Obama had a supermajority in the Senate, then that was bad, and the nine Justices were good since 1869. And suddenly, they didn`t flip like--

CARLSON: Right.

HANSON: --they usually do in a Republican. And so, it`s whatever is useful, the - the law is - is fluid and adaptable. It`s about power, Tucker. It`s not about the respect for the law and the--

CARLSON: You`re exactly right.

HANSON: --abstract.

CARLSON: Yes. And I think a lot of us, including me, very often, are far too literal and take these arguments as if they`re sincere, which they are not. Professor, thank you.

HANSON: Thank you.

CARLSON: Across the country, extremists are attacking candidates for office but, of course, only of one party. The media`s message is to vote for Democrats anyway or you`re a bad person. Much tape on that as the show continues tonight from the Nixon Library in Yorba Linda, California.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

CARLSON: Welcome back. We`re coming to you live tonight from Yorba Linda, California. We`re actually in the front lawn of the home Richard Nixon was born in and he grew up in.

Want to bring you new video from Houston, Texas. It shows a man being confronted for ripping up Ted Cruz yard signs. It happened in the wealthy Liberal neighborhood of Montrose. Be warned. The video is upsetting. In that it shows a lunatic in his natural habitat. Here it is.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would watch. Be careful.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you --

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know what? I have bought a 100 of these. I`m about to--

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --put more out.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Cool, all right. Well I`ll tear it up.

I hate Ted Cruz. I hate Ted Cruz. I hate Ted Cruz.

I hate Ted Cruz.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Well we`re not licensed veterinarians, but it does seem obvious the Zombie Raccoon Virus is spreading outside of the Northeast, so stay safe.

Well despite plenty of examples of violence and extremism and mob behavior from the Left, the media have decided to ban the word ""Mob,"" and coalesce around a new storyline, ""You better vote Democrat or you`re a racist, sexist or, literally, a traitor to your country.""

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)

MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC: --quislings meekly march in lockstep behind a morally disabled president. I don`t know how you do it. It`s appalling.

AMANDA CARPENTER, POLITICAL ADVISER: People are just trying to make Liberals scream and cry. And they laugh about it, right? Like there is a mug that they`ll hold up and say ""Liberal tears,"" and they laugh as they drink it. The cruelty is the point of that.

LEMON: They voted for their cruel person who demeans and diminishes people.

BAKARI SELLERS, ATTORNEY: I don`t understand how you overlook misogamy, sexism, racism. I don`t understand how you can just sit back and say, ""You know what, all of that`s OK because I`m going to get, you know, all of these judges elected or I`m going to get a tax break."" I - I just think that there is - that - that - that`s not what it means to be American.

(END VIDEO CLIPS)

CARLSON: Dan Bongino was a former NYPD officer, NRATV contributor, author of the book Spygate: The Attempted Sabotage of Donald J. Trump. Dan, thanks a lot for coming on tonight. There`s been a shift.

DAN BONGINO, FORMER AGENT OF THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE: Thank you.

CARLSON: So when Trump got elected, obviously, shocked and horrified a lot of people in Washington, in New York, but they for a while decided to attack him and not the tens of millions people who voted for him, not the whole middle of the country. Now, they are. Now the idea is it`s not just Trump who is bad, it`s anyone who might support Trump is bad.

BONGINO: Yes. This is really an incredible phenomenon. I mean - I mean I have never seen anything like this where the media is playing referee solely for one side. It`s like a boxing match where, you know, one side`s wearing brass knuckles, we`re wearing 20 ounce gloves, and they`re yelling at us for a kidney punch or something, Tucker.

It`s ridiculous. But there`s a couple things going on here. Number one, the - the Leftist freak-out is basically due to their, you know, their coin of the realm is state power. And when they lose state power, they`re takers, right, they can`t take. They can`t take your money. They can`t take your healthcare. They don`t have anything else but aggression, right?

Now, the media polices that on the Right. Matter of fact, the media even makes up stories about was that commentator you showed, was she even serious? She`s worried about a mug that says Liberal tears, while Antifa`s beating the snot out of people in this is that.

I mean I`m serious. Is that a serious comment like a mug that says Liberal tears--

CARLSON: Well--

BONGINO: --while there`s actual people getting the crap beaten out of them in the streets. It`s absurd.

CARLSON: I want to show you a - a piece of tape we just got. I think it`s from Portland, Oregon. It`s otherwise a beautiful city, I have to say. Watch this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why are you trying to block me? I`m (BEEP) trying to walk here.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don`t like traveling sneakers.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You`re a (BEEP) snarky little (BEEP) idiot. Shut the (BEEP) up.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Try something (BEEP).

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I`m not. I`m not going to punch you. I`m not like your husband. I`m not going to punch you.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I`m not married.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I`m not like your boyfriend or your cop boyfriend who`s going to (BEEP) knock you out, so don`t worry--

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My husband died 9/11.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hi, it`s free.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good for him. Good. Good.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That`s your point --

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Those NY - NYPD were a bunch of (BEEP) sodomizing (BEEP) sodomizing immigrants with their bully sticks. So yes, you`re (BEEP). Your husband should probably--

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What are you saying?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --(BEEP) just rot in the grave.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: He - he doesn`t know her. She`s wearing an NYPD hat, so he starts screaming her. My husband died on 9/11, she says. Good, he says. What`s going on here?

BONGINO: You know, Tucker, Truck 7 of the Emergency Services Unit of the NYPD was in the precinct I was in, in the 75th Precinct when I was a cop. They lost multiple members running in those buildings on 9/11 to save people`s lives.

And this piece of human filth, this disgusting savage animal has to - has the gall to say that to - say this to this woman who may have lost a loved one there on 9/11. I mean this is grotesque behavior.

And Tucker, you and I both know darn well, and thankfully so, that if that was some Conservative from some Tea Party group who had done that to a Liberal, he would be banned from any news channel, any Republican group and polite conversation from now until eternity.

Where is the Left speaking out with a collective voice? As you pointed out before, they used to be the party of civil liberties, right, saying this kind of stuff is not welcome.

CARLSON: Yes.

BONGINO: Let`s get back to ideas. And the media has a role in this too, which they`ve entirely abandoned.

CARLSON: It does seem the closer we get to an election, the more united the press becomes in its mission, which is to carry water for the Democratic Party. I mean all the kind of pretense falls away and they just basically are running a continuous 24-hour-a-day commercial for the Democrats.

BONGINO: Tucker, it`s a straight-up power play. It`s the reason the immigration argument`s covered the way it is as well. This was never about compassion for immigrants. It`s not about refugees.

CARLSON: Yes--

BONGINO: This is about votes.

CARLSON: --of course not.

BONGINO: They lost votes amongst working-class people, and they`re trying to make it up with illegal immigrant votes. This has always been the play.

CARLSON: Yes. If they - if they cared, they`d be concerned about the tens of thousands of Americans dying every year of drug ODs, but they don`t. Dan, great to see you.

BONGINO: Good to see you too.

CARLSON: Well if you`re Conservative, you probably grew up believing the government might be the biggest threat to free expression. It turns out it`s not. Big tech, which is more powerful than the government, is.

Could Republicans in the Congress take action to protect the public from their influence while they still hold the House? We`ll ask one Congressman next.

Freedom of speech is under threat in this country because the people who hold power have stopped seeing the value of it and other constitutional rights, not to mention the Constitution itself. That is all described the sad, and yet, riveting story in a new book called ""Ship of Fools,"" still on sale.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

CARLSON: Well the ominous tech monopoly, Google, recently announced it will not work with the U.S. Pentagon on a defense project due to ethical concerns. That problem has not arisen as they work hard to build a censored search engine to help the fascist Chinese government repress its own people.

But private messages from Google employees, obtained by this program, show Google`s refusal to help national defense in this country may be for the best. In 2016, shortly after the Presidential election, a one-time Google employee called Bryan Klimt wrote this.

""If the government wants a company to build some software for unethical purposes, we should volunteer to do it. I gladly take project management responsibility for such a thing. I promise the deadlines will slip for decades and we`ll never produce anything remotely functional."" In other words, he would sabotage it.

A Google engineer called Javier Estevez responded by linking to a CIA document giving tips for ""Simple sabotage."" Another engineer called Gary Boyer seemed to like the idea but lamented their strategy would have to remain hidden. Estevez and Boyer still work at Google.

We reached out to the company, which commented this way. ""What employees say in their personal capacity has no bearing on the way we build or operate our products."" They didn`t apologize. They didn`t explain.

Meanwhile, Twitter announced yesterday it won`t be banning or even suspending Louis Farrakhan after he made a post that compared Jews to termites.

As we`ve often noted, we don`t have a problem with free speech. We support it strongly. We just wish Twitter would extend the same courtesy to people who aren`t Democratic stalwarts, like Louis Farrakhan.

Last month, Twitter took part in the coordinated purge of Alex Jones and Infowars from multiple online platforms. Twitter suspended many other accounts for reasons it won`t fully explain, but which appear to be political. We`re against that, of course. The question is can Congress do something about it as well?

Congressman Jim Jordan represents Ohio, and he joins us tonight. Congressman, thanks very much for coming on.

REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO: You bet.

CARLSON: Before I ask you about Twitter, I want to ask you what you make of these internal messages from Google that show Google employees--

JORDAN: Yes, it`s--

CARLSON: --apparently joking about sabotaging a defense--

JORDAN: Yes.

CARLSON: --a Department of Defense project? What does that tell you about how they view the U.S. government--

JORDAN: Well--

CARLSON: --and this country?

JORDAN: --it shows you how ridiculous the Left has become. Limit conservative speech, sabotage national defense, allow anti-Semitic language on your platforms, but restrict conservative speech.

I mean the Left - I mean think, I said this the other day. The Left will applaud Colin Kaepernick when he disrespects the flag, they`ll cheer on Cuomo when he says America is never that great, and they`ll applaud Maxine Waters when she says go out and harass people who support the President and, yet, they allow Louis Farrakhan`s speech but restrict conservatives.

I mean this is - this is the ridiculous level we have now gotten to, the absurd level, I think, we`ve now gotten to in this country, and it`s unfortunate.

CARLSON: Well it`s certainly dark. That`s for sure. So Twitter, it is the portal through which a lot of people get their news.

JORDAN: Yes.

CARLSON: I mean it`s - it`s not just a social medium. It`s an important part of our - of our news landscape. And they are obviously political in the way they censor.

JORDAN: Yes.

CARLSON: Does Congress have a role in that?

JORDAN: Well I - I think they are political. You know, there are 435 Members of the - of the House, a 100 Members of the Senate. 535. This summer, four got shadow-banned, Devin Nunes, Matt Gaetz, Mark Meadows, and Jim Jordan, four Conservative Members of the House.

CARLSON: Yes.

JORDAN: And of course, CEO, Jack Dorsey said, ""Well it was just a problem, just a glitch in our algorithm.""

I mean well think about that. So, what did you put in the algorithm? The names Gaetz, Meadows, Nunes, Jordan? I mean come on. There is no way that is the answer. So this is - this is where we`ve got --Tucker, we`re doing a series of hearings on the First Amendment in the Oversight Committee.

And at our most recent one, I asked this college professor, he was a witness for the Democrats. I asked this college professor, I said, ""On a college campus safe space, could I say this sentence? Donald Trump is President.""

He began his response with these words, ""It depends."" And I interrupt him, I said, ""It depends. It`s a fact. He got elected November 8, 2016. He was sworn in January 2017. He lives at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. There`s no ""It depends"" about it.""

This is the level of absurdity--

CARLSON: Right.

JORDAN: --the Left is taking us to, and it is a direct attack on the First Amendment.

CARLSON: But I mean these companies are more powerful in their technology than the U.S. government. The U.S. government has nothing as powerful as Google, nothing as close. They control--

JORDAN: Right.

CARLSON: --our national conversation. They have a chokehold on all human information in English. So why doesn`t the U.S. Congress see--

JORDAN: Well--

CARLSON: --their clamp down on speech as a threat to all American citizens? I mean can we do something about this or do we stand--

JORDAN: I--

CARLSON: --idly by?

JORDAN: No, I - I think you`re right. But I think it`s - it`s a multiple step process. And we`re at step one, which is we first need to understand how serious this problem is, how big it is.

Is it every single social media platform? There`s certainly lots of examples. You mentioned Google. We know what Twitter has done. We know what Jack Dorsey has said. So, let`s have the hearings. Let`s get to the bottom of it.

And then you`re right. We may have to take action to protect the First Amendment and protect people`s ability to speak out in a conservative fashion and not be hindered for doing so.

CARLSON: Yes. Or a liberal fashion, but to speak, I mean--

JORDAN: Yes. Well correct --

CARLSON: --this - the First Amendment doesn`t mean anything if you can`t exercise it.

JORDAN: No, right, I mean the First - the First--

CARLSON: I mean that. Congressman--

JORDAN: --Amendment wasn`t written--

CARLSON: Yes.

JORDAN: --just for speech we like. It was written for all speech. But right now, it doesn`t seem--

CARLSON: Of course.

JORDAN: --they - they allow Liberal and - and they allow all kinds of crazy things to be said as the Farrakhan example is such crazy language like that, but they`re going to restrict conservatives and their ability to speak? It`s just not right and it`s something we`re going to have to look into.

CARLSON: Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio, thank you very much.

JORDAN: You bet. Thank you, Tucker.

CARLSON: The President is speaking tonight in Missoula, Montana. We`re monitoring that speech should news arise. It may. And if it does, we`ll go there.

(CROWD CHEERING)

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Right now though, it`s time for a special Traveling Edition of Final Exam. Two California radio show hosts with us here at the Nixon Library, and that`s next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

CARLSON: Time now for Final Exam where we choose two world-renowned experts in the news to see who has been paying closer attention to the news over the past week. We`re on the road this week in California, so tonight we have a special Travel Edition of Final Exam.

Our two contestants, two of our favorite Liberal radio hosts, both based here in California, Leslie Marshall and Ethan Bearman.

OK, contestants. This is a little bit different from the way we normally do it. We have buzzers, typically. Those were confiscated at the airport by the California EPA. Turns out they were plastic in the same category as straws.

So tonight, I`m going to ask the questions, and the first one to raise a hand gets to answer the question. I don`t trust myself to make that judgment. We have an independent panel of judges to determine whose hand went up first.

You must wait until I finish asking the question before you answer it. Please answer once I acknowledge you by saying your name. Each correct answer worth one point. You get it wrong, you lose a point. Best of five wins. Is the math clear?

LESLIE MARSHALL, RADIO SHOW HOST: Yes.

ETHAN BEARMAN, RADIO SHOW HOST: Yes.

CARLSON: Particularly hard questions tonight. Here they go. Question one, which nation became the second place on planet Earth to legalize marijuana nationwide?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ethan.

CARLSON: Ethan Bearman.

BEARMAN: Canada.

CARLSON: Canada. Is it Canada? Roll tape.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Canada has gone to pot. Our neighbors to the north legalizing recreational marijuana overnight.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BEARMAN: Yes.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can`t wait to come in and see me buy the first gram in Canada. That`s like the most amazing thing ever. How many people get to do that? How many people get to be part of history in the making?

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: So, for an extra point, which you`ll not actually be awarded, what - wait, congratulations, you won that.

BEARMAN: Thank you.

CARLSON: What was the first country?

BEARMAN: Portugal.

CARLSON: Portugal? Think it was Paraguay. But it would be - it was definitely starting with a P.

BEARMAN: OK.

CARLSON: OK. Good. Well it was Paraguay, said our judges.

BEARMAN: Was it Paraguay?

CARLSON: That`s an irrelevant question. Shouldn`t even like no--

BEARMAN: The point --

CARLSON: Uruguay. We`re both wrong. OK.

Question two, before we embarrass ourselves more, multiple choice here. The filmmaker, Michael Moore, would like Trump out of office so badly he is trying to recruit famous people, celebrities, to run against him. Moore just confessed that his top pick is A, George Clooney, B, Ben Affleck, C, Tom Hanks?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Leslie.

CARLSON: Leslie Marshall.

MARSHALL: George Clooney.

CARLSON: George Clooney. Is it George Clooney?

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MICHAEL MOORE, LEFT-WING ACTIVIST: I`ve asked Tom Hanks twice to run.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.

MOORE: Who doesn`t like Tom hanks? Nobody, right? Tom Hanks would --

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What does he say when you ring him and say ""Please--

MOORE: No.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: --save the country.""

MOORE: Stop asking me.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Well he just outed Tom Hanks as someone he speaks to. How`d you like Michael Moore to confess that he talked to you? I think that`s mean. OK. Unfortunately, you didn`t get that right. I thought you were right.

Question three comes from the State of Texas. The Senate candidate there on the Democratic side, Robert Francis Beto O`Rourke, is trailing in the polls. He has now decided to win allegiance of voters by doing something brand new.

He recently rolled on stage in front of hundreds of cheering teenagers riding what?

BEARMAN: Hmm.

CARLSON: What was Robert Francis Beto O`Rourke riding? It has wheels. If you were incredibly hip and looked like a young Bobby Kennedy but grew up near the beach, you might ride this cot --

Ethan.

BEARMAN: Skateboard.

CARLSON: Is it skateboard?

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

(CROWD CHEERING)

(END VIDEO CLIP)

MARSHALL: He rides.

CARLSON: He yes --

BEARMAN: It`s structure --

CARLSON: I clearly don`t know but --

MARSHALL: Ethan hints --

CARLSON: I mean just one second - I don`t begrudge either one of you not guessing that Robert Francis Beto O`Rourke rode a skateboard. I mean I personally thought it was roller-skates but like what do I know about politics.

MARSHALL: I thought it was a motorcycle.

CARLSON: Yes. That would have been cool, by the way, maybe gotten my vote.

All right, question four, again a multiple choice. Boston Dynamics is a company that makes robots, terrifying robots. Its famous Robot Dog named Spot has just acquired a brand new talent. What is that talent?

Is it A, the robot dog can make pancakes, B, it can dance and twerk to pop music, or C, it can drive a truck?

Ethan.

BEARMAN: B. Dance and twerk.

MARSHALL: That`s right.

CARLSON: It can dance? A dancing and twerking robot dog, is that a real thing?

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

(ROBOT DANCING TO UPTOWN FUNK)

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: This robot because it`s the one thing America needs.

BEARMAN: No question.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

(ROBOT DANCING TO UPTOWN FUNK)

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Driving a truck, cure cancer? No. Twerk.

BEARMAN: But now you can arm it and it can, you know, go hunt down terrorists while dancing.

CARLSON: By the way that - I mean that might be worth having. All right final question--

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sun down --

CARLSON: Time to celebrate because there is a new Royal baby on the way, apparently. Prince Harry and his American wife are expecting a child. They received several gifts from the government of Australia, including some warm and furry footwear. What kind of footwear was it?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Leslie.

MARSHALL: Uggs.

CARLSON: Uggs. Is that an exclamation or is that an - OK, Uggs. Is it Uggs?

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex receiving their first official gift celebrating the announcement of an expanding family. From Australia, they got a fluffy stuffed kangaroo and a fleeced baby-sized Uggs. It`s kind of cute. Probably pick one up at the airport too.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So happy for the Royal couple.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely --

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Would you take that? Would - I mean is that really a present?

MARSHALL: Yes.

CARLSON: They`re not even in sale right?

MARSHALL: No. No. They`re made - I think they`re made there, right? They`re made--

CARLSON: I guess. I didn`t know that till now.

MARSHALL: Yes.

CARLSON: All right.

BEARMAN: They have winter in England. So they need baby Uggs, especially the--

CARLSON: That`s a really good point. Ethan Bearman is the winner.

MARSHALL: No.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.

CARLSON: No?

BEARMAN: What?

CARLSON: Ethan Bearman, I think it`s three points. Ethan, you win. Leslie, you were a great person. And it`s great to see you both.

MARSHALL: Thanks, Tucker.

CARLSON: Thank you very much for competing outdoors at the Nixon Library here in Yorba Linda.

BEARMAN: Thank you, Tucker.

CARLSON: We appreciate that.

MARSHALL: Thank you.

CARLSON: That`s it for tonight`s Final Exam. Pay very close attention to the news each week, particularly the weird news, and then tune in Thursday nights to see if you can outwit our experts. We`ll be right back, after the break.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

CARLSON: Well the MeToo movement has certainly expanded its scope. It started, as you`ll remember, with Hollywood producers. That seemed fine. Then they went after actors and performers. Now, MeToo seems to be taking out movies themselves.

Actress Keira Knightley says she won`t let her kids watch Disney Princess movies because of the messages they send. Here`s what she explained earlier this week.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ELLEN LEE DEGENERES, AMERICAN COMEDIAN, TELEVISION HOST, ACTRESS, WRITER, PRODUCER, LGBT ACTIVIST: She`s banned from seeing certain children`s movies, right?

KEIRA KNIGHTLEY, ENGLISH ACTRESS: Yes.

DEGENERES: What are they?

KNIGHTLEY: Cinderella, banned because, you know, she - she waits around for a rich guy to rescue her. Don`t. Rescue yourself, obviously.

DEGENERES: Right.

(CROWD CHEERING)

KNIGHTLEY: --but Little Mermaid. I mean the songs are great but do not give your voice up for a man. Hello?

DEGENERES: Wow.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: And you thought mindless 1970s second-wave feminism was over. No, it`s back in force.

Kristen Bell meanwhile says she isn`t comfortable having her kids watch Snow White because it ends with Snow White being kissed by Prince Charming without prior consent, even though that kiss raises her from death. Better to die than not get consent.

Author and columnist Mark Steyn joins us tonight. Mark, kind of hard to create art within the boundaries of these ideological imperatives, is it not?

MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: Yes, it is. Apparently, you`re only allowed to have one school of propaganda now. I personally don`t let my kids watch Keira Knightley movies because for the last 15 years, sylphlike Keira Knightley has taken down entire pirate crew single- handed in Pirates of the Caribbean.

When she was - when she played Guinevere in King Arthur, somewhat to my surprise if for anybody who`s seen Camelot, this Queen Guinevere covers herself in blue woad and goes into full-blown woad rage and takes out a thousand hairy Saxon guys single-handed.

And if you`re asking me which is inherently more--

CARLSON: Ooh.

STEYN: --ludicrous, Cinderella where the coach turns back into a pumpkin or the average Keira Knightley movie where she dispatches single-handedly a thousand hairy Saxons, I`d have to give it to the coach turning back into a pumpkin. We`re all entitled all--

CARLSON: So--

STEYN: --all that - all this is simply fashion, fashions in fairy tales. And the - and the feminist fairy tales of Kristen Bell and Keira Knightley are no more inherently unludicrous than anything that`s gone before.

CARLSON: There`s an awful lot of violence in these feminist fantasies, I noticed. So, it`s totally cool to expose your girls to movies in which women slay people with swords, but it`s immoral to let them see movies in which they get kissed?

STEYN: Yes. I think that`s true. I mean I think if you see someone, for example, this is an important point about the Prince and Snow White. You know, if you see someone who`s down on the floor and ceased breathing, don`t give them the kiss of life because under the - the feminist rules, you can`t kiss someone without permission. So, it`s very important just to leave them there dying as the Prince is now expected to do to Snow White.

Personally, I think if we`re going to remake these things we should do it the whole way, and we should have - instead of having whatever it is with the Seven Snow White and Seven Dwarfs, Sleepy, Happy, Grumpy, we should have Snow White who makes the mistake of going to a Hollywood mansion and the Seven Dwarfs are Harvey, Woody, Spacey, Charlie, Rose and a couple of the other fellas and - and go the full way with re-makes.

But basically, they`re exposing what is the problem with their art so- called, in that, it`s essentially meant to function as propaganda. And when it`s propaganda--

CARLSON: That`s right.

STEYN: --it becomes boring. These are universal`s fairy tales across all cultures--

CARLSON: Right.

STEYN: --and there`s a reason for that, and there`s a reason why Keira Knightley kick-assing a thousand hairy Saxons is not a prevailing fairy tale across all cultures.

CARLSON: Right. Dark propaganda in which human warmth is outlawed but violence is celebrated. It`s pretty sick--

STEYN: Yes. Yes.

CARLSON: --actually.

STEYN: No, that`s right.

CARLSON: Well Mark Steyn--

STEYN: Feminist violence.

CARLSON: --great to see you.

STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.

CARLSON: It`s dis - it`s disgusting. See you.

Well the investigation continues tonight into the disappearance of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. We have an update on that story.

Plus, we`re watching the President`s rally in Montana for any breaking news. And, of course, we`ll bring it to you when it occurs.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Who said that? Who said that?

(CROWD CHEERING)

TRUMP: It`s finally a woman. You know, I get it from the men all the time.

(CROWD CHEERING)

TRUMP: And so far, every guy that said I love you, they`re just not my type.

(CROWD CHEERING)

TRUMP: I finally heard it from a woman, thank you. Thank you.

(CROWD CHEERING)

TRUMP: And look at all the Women for Trump signs. Here we go again, it`s the same thing. Everyone says but will he get the women? They don`t tell - you know, these fakers on television, the pundits, you know, real geniuses, they`ve really done well in predicting me.

(CROWD CHEERING)

TRUMP: He`s never going to run. He has too good a life. He`s just doing it for fun. He`ll never run but he`s having a good time. I said that`s a good time? Sorry.

Then September, one by one we knock them off, knock them off, knock them off. Remember? 18 people, 17 opponents, very talented opponents in many cases, not in all cases, but in many cases. I remember Charles Krauthammer, and he was talking good.

(CROWD CHEERING)

(END VIDEO CLIP)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

CARLSON: This is a Fox News Alert. The President holding a rally tonight in Missoula, Montana. He`s rallying support there for Matt Rosendale`s challenge to Senator Jon Tester. Stay with Fox for any news that emerges from that rally tonight. We`re on it.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: She hears that --

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Well international pressure on Saudi Arabia is rising intensely over the disappearance and apparent murder of Journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Out of nowhere, for reasons that are not exactly clear, this has become one of the biggest stories in the world.

And so, we wanted to update you on it. Trace Gallagher has the very latest, and he joins us tonight. Hey Trace.

TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Hey, Tucker. The President had indicated that whatever happened to Khashoggi wasn`t good. But on board Air Force One, en route to Montana, he was asked directly if he thinks Khashoggi is dead and said, ""It certainly looks that way.""

Keep in mind, his comments were made after the President was briefed by Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo who just returned from Saudi Arabia. Pompeo says he told the President that Saudi Arabia should be given a few more days to complete its investigation before the U.S. decides how, or if, to respond. Watch.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MICHAEL RICHARD POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: We made clear to them that we take this matter with respect to Mr. Khashoggi very seriously. They made clear to me that they too understand the serious nature of the disappearance of Mr. Khashoggi.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GALLAGHER: And in turn, when he was asked about the consequences facing the Saudi Kingdom, President Trump said this. Listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: Well it`ll have to be very severe. I mean it`s just bad, bad stuff. But we`ll see what happens.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GALLAGHER: Yes. Turkish investigators say Khashoggi was killed then dismembered by a Saudi hit team inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Numerous reports say the Saudis will claim his death was an interrogation gone wrong.

But now a Turkish newspaper says a top aide and frequent companion of Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman entered the Saudi Consulate in Turkey, hours before Khashoggi arrived. The photo of Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb is the strongest evidence yet linking the Crown Prince to the disappearance of Khashoggi.

Tucker.

CARLSON: Trace Gallagher, thanks for that update.

Murdered, huh? Doesn`t sound like something a medieval desert theocracy would do. That`s about it for us tonight. We are live at the Nixon Library, a very pretty place here in California.

We`ll be back tomorrow night, the show that is the sworn, but cheerful, enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. DVR it if you can. We dare you. Goodnight from California.

""Hannity"" is next with Rush Limbaugh for the hour.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We`re making a statement, a very strong statement. But we`re waiting for the results of about three different investigations. And we should be able to get to the bottom fairly soon. And I will see you on the plane.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: All right, the president making it clear just moments ago something is up and there will be reaction that will be a follow-up to all this.

Welcome, everybody. I`m Neil Cavuto, and this is ""Your World.""

Stocks selling off amid indications that the battle royal with Saudi Arabia is on. What they knew and when they knew it, and who was part of this coordinated attack on the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi?

Increasingly, signs point to Saudi Arabia, but, again, the president wouldn`t tip his hand what he knows or what his secretary of state knows.

Let`s go to Kevin Corke at the White House with the very, very latest.

Hey, Kevin.

KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Neil, a lot of people were wondering if the treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, would make his way to Saudi Arabia for the FII.

And, if I might, just to quote Paulie from ""Goodfellas,"" you got to keep up appearances. Of course he couldn`t go, especially given what the administration obviously knows based on preliminary information that may have been picked up by the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo.

So, today, Mr. Mnuchin took to Twitter to tell the world what precipitated his decision.

He said: ""Just met with @realDonaldTrump and Secretary Pompeo."" And note this, Neil. ""We have decided I will not be participating in the Future Investment Initiative summit in Saudi Arabia.""

Of course, Secretary Pompeo had just returned from his trips to Turkey and Saudi Arabia in search of answers into the apparent murder and possible dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who obviously is a Saudi national, but had been in this country for quite some time, his work often appearing in The Washington Post.

Secretary Pompeo making it clear today this issue will not go away anytime soon, as the investigation continues both on the ground in Riyadh and in Istanbul and elsewhere.

I should also point this out for you, Neil. You may have mentioned this on your broadcast earlier today. But FBN, we understand, has also canceled its involvement in the Davos in the Desert event. As we get more information, certainly, we will pass this along to you. But it seems apparent from everything we have seen both on the record and off something`s up.

And we should be learning a lot more about what happened in the days ahead -- Neil.

CAVUTO: All right, buddy, thank you very, very much, Kevin Corke.

A lot of people have sent their regrets, but a lot of people are not the treasury secretary of the United States, the highest-ranking representative from the United States slated to go to Saudi Arabia for this big financial summit.

I want to show you the inflection point at that point, where you see that rounded dot to the left of your screen on this chart, for those of you listening. We were already down 200 points at that point. We quickly cascaded south, and then were rocky the rest of the day, finishing down about 326 points.

The concern being here that if we get up with the Saudis, could there be an impact on oil? There was a measurable impact on defense and defense- related issues, amid growing concern that that contract that many of them already signed and thought was sealed and delivered with the Saudis last year totaling more than $110 billion, that that could be unwound or just canceled outright, and that things could go from bad to worse.

So, that was weighing on the markets appreciably.

Let`s go to Deirdre Bolton, who is keeping track of it all -- Deirdre.

DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Certainly keeping track.

And, Neil, I was looking at intraday chart, and the statement was right before midday, right when the treasury secretary pulled out of going to that conference in Saudi Arabia. But it is also worth noting that even before that, as you just mentioned, the markets had gotten out of the gate with a very slow start.

So, overnight in Asia, Shanghai, that composite dropping by close to 3 percent, trading at a four-year. A Macquarie economist putting out a note about China`s continued slowdown in its credit growth. There`s really a lot of worries about Chinese economic growth.

There`s going to be a figure coming out, third-quarter numbers for China on Friday. And, of course, as many cynics say, you can`t really believe what data is being published, but there are more and more people concerned that actually the trade tariffs are hurting the Chinese economy and that it will be growing at a much slower pace than many global investors had factored in.

It`s not just Asia. We turn our attention to Europe. Most investors taking a look at some of those comments from the ECB president, Mario Draghi. Essentially, he said, one of the biggest risks for the global economy was countries trying to circumvent E.U. budget rules.

Essentially, everyone took that to mean Italy. And there are more and more concerns about whether or not Italy will actually make its debt payments. And, in fact, if you look at Italy`s benchmark 10-year notes, they were at their highest in four-and-a-half years.

So if stocks have sold off around the world, as they did, where did money go? In the U.S., they went into treasuries. So we saw our own yields trade around multiyear highs, short-term two-year, highest level since 2008, and even the 10-year, that went above 3.2 percent. That 10-year yield, of course, used as a benchmark for mortgage rates, at its highest level since 2011.

So there are even others who begin to worry this pressure will eventually even affect our housing market, as well as others -- Neil, back to you.

CAVUTO: All right, thank you very much, Deirdre Bolton.

Here`s the worry here. We just don`t know where this ends. We know the administration is planning some response, or they wouldn`t have shelved the treasury secretary and his attendance at that -- at that Saudi Arabian investor conference.

What we don`t know is exactly what they`re going to do. It`s all in response to these charges or suspicions that the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, might have been behind or even orchestrated this interrogation either gone bad or an interrogation that was a planned murder of Jamal Khashoggi, The Washington Post columnist.

Be that as it may have, what would it take to satisfy American officials? Would they be satisfied with just replacing the prince with another prince? He has 12 other brothers. The king can decide on that.

But in this kingdom where a lot of the leaders are sort of seen as princes in a PEZ dispenser, will a different character change the character of Saudi Arabia? A lot of people fear it will not and that this could escalate.

Let`s go to Gary B. Smith and Larry Shover on all of these developments.

Larry, what would it take for markets to calm and think an adequate retribution has been gained?

LARRY SHOVER, SOLUTIONS FUNDS GROUP: Well, I think it`s just going to take time. It`s going to take -- the micro-factors have to shift as well.

I mean, obviously, what`s going on in Saudi Arabia a huge deal, but one thing I have learned in 35 years is that fundamentals will eventually dictate the duration of a market cycle. And our fundamentals are really solid.

Keep in mind, look at the oil market. It took eight weeks for oil to come back to earth. It went up on momentum and nothing else. A lot of what- ifs. There was nothing really there. And then, when they realized that spare capacity is there, it`s getting online, we`re back to where we were in the middle of the August.

CAVUTO: No, no, you`re right. We`re getting into -- that`s a whole `nother story here.

SHOVER: Yes.

CAVUTO: But what`s interesting, Gary B., is this idea that an entire sector, like the defense sector, could be impacted by this, technology could be impacted by this.

These are the same industries that were drawn to and benefiting from a relationship with Saudi Arabia. Now the fear seems to be, whatever you think of the character of the royal family, or lack thereof in the royal prince`s case, it`s going to get -- it`s going to get worse, or they could go elsewhere, or they could escalate the tension with us in a -- in an unending tit for tat.

What do you think?

GARY B. SMITH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I tell you what, Neil.

You and I have lived through these scares many times. And what normally happens is, the rhetoric gets to the market first, and entire sector sell off almost without discrimination.

And I think what we have learned is, when that happens, when the -- kind of the sell first, look for the facts later, it`s probably time to buy that industry. It was going to be that the China trade war, for example, was going to pretty much decimate the entire U.S. economy.

And yet it was really only and still maybe 0.2 percent effect on our GDP, if all the tariffs are collected, which is unlikely. So if you bought on the first sell-off on the China tariffs, you`re probably in the money right now.

I expect the market will go down, because we don`t have facts yet or full facts on Saudi Arabia. China obviously has not been -- fully disclosed what`s going to happen, what`s going on there.

But I think at this point, I agree with Larry. You got to first look at the fundamentals. Then, what are we selling on? We`re selling on the news. That probably means it`s time to buy.

CAVUTO: Larry, you could look at this as well and start surmising that, truth be told, you said the fundamentals are good. The economy is very good. Earnings are really good.

We got more proof of that today with the likes of Philip Morris. Look at the airlines. Businesses are booking these business class and first-class seats like crazy. These guys are making money hand over fist, even in the face of higher jet fuel prices.

So that is the wind at the market`s back, the economy`s back. I get all of that.

But I`m curious what you think could -- could push it. I mean, earnings are better than expected. Earnings are coming in stronger than expected. But any bumps like this are a worry going forward. So how do you guide your investors?

SHOVER: Hmm.

Well, I tell them and I tell myself, look at the long term and try to avoid the speed bumps that come on day to day. I mean, yes, what`s unfolding here could be absolutely enormous, but it seems like it`s always -- it`s always better than fear.

And I think we just need to fade that first move and just look at the long- term projections in the market, be completely diversified at all times, and just hope for the best.

I mean, it seems like so often the news is much worse than reality. We don`t have all the facts. And markets just react to momentum and emotion, not fundamentals.

CAVUTO: The fundamentals sound for you, Gary B.? What do you think?

SMITH: Yes, I agree.

I think it`s always easiest to look -- everyone should go and figure out what they`re doing every day, what companies they`re using. I watched Netflix last night, I ordered from Amazon today, and stopped off at the local T.J. Maxx. Those companies are not going away no matter what happens with China, no matter what happens with the Saudis. They`re going to keep growing.

I think you saw Netflix like leaps and bounds.

CAVUTO: Right.

SMITH: I think there`s still a lot of great, safe pockets out there.

CAVUTO: All right, gentlemen, I want to thank you all very, very much.

Again, for those just tuning into, the Dow down about 327 points on all of this. Most of it had to do in Saudi Arabia. Is that fair? Is that right? Is that overdone?

Claudia Rosett is not a stock market analyst, but she is a darn good foreign policy expert. She joins us right now.

You always wonder whether markets overreact. Are they overreacting?

CLAUDIA ROSETT, FOREIGN POLICY FELLOW, INDEPENDENT WOMEN`S FORUM: Neil, I`m not even sure how much of what they`re doing right now is due to this.

But I do certainly think that the media at the moment is overreacting.

CAVUTO: OK.

So, when it comes to Saudi Arabia, everyone, it seems -- we`re going to do something. I don`t know what that ultimately will be. We`re going to demand something.

ROSETT: Yes. Yes.

CAVUTO: And then we wait to see what the Saudis do in response. What do you think?

ROSETT: Yes.

Well, you know what? Look, something apparently quite terrible happened here, if what we`re -- the bits that we`re hearing turn out to be accurate, it was a gruesome, horrible assassination, and not a good thing for any country to be doing.

At the same time, we`re hearing these calls for America to completely change its foreign policy, to -- that this should now become the signal event shaping American policy in the Middle East.

And the problem in the Middle East is, pick your poison. We`re up against right now Iran, where, remember, we still don`t want them to get a nuclear bomb. And the Saudis have -- this is the way that the Trump administration has been shaping this, is to go to the Saudis as a counterweight.

And there has been an opening between the Saudis and the Israelis. That`s -- that`s useful. And the problem with just saying, OK, let`s completely shun the Saudis, make them a pariah, pay whatever price it takes in the markets, let`s just stand here and -- is, you have then the problem of, this becomes a gift to Iran, which, if we`re worried about horrible killings, has its own juvenile executions.

Ambassador Nikki Haley was complaining to the U.N. today that Iran recruits child soldiers. So it -- we should absolutely be condemning this, if it turns out to be the story we have heard, but, no, this is not the time to reshape American foreign policy.

CAVUTO: You also think of those who have embraced the deal with Iran that the president canceled and said, I`m going to start from scratch here.

And there were -- there was anger on that, with a proven regime that has done awful, awful things.

And I`m just wondering whether we get our perspective screwed up.

ROSETT: Yes.

The answer is that perspective right now is pretty off the charts. This is a gripping story. Again, we wait to -- we don`t even know yet if it`s accurate.

And Karen Elliott House had a good piece in The Wall Street Journal the other day. She said it`s a story with a victim and villains, but no heroes. Look, the Turks, who are the world leaders in jailing journalists, Released Pastor Brunson, as they said the Saudis did this.

And here we get into a home mess in the Middle East, the Turks` friendly relations with the Iranians. The Turks have been big helpers with Iranian sanctions evasion in the past. Remember, Iran is getting a whole new batch of sanctions from the U.S.

CAVUTO: Very good point.

ROSETT: And Iran benefits if we then shun the Saudis.

So, I say, by all means, Steve Mnuchin shouldn`t -- our secretary of the treasury -- fine with me if he wants to skip the Saudi investment conference. That sounded like something of a farce anyway.

(LAUGHTER)

ROSETT: But, no, do not change foreign policy. We actually are dealing with some very bad actors here. There are a lot of other lives on the line.

CAVUTO: Yes, this is not exactly a Boy Scout neighborhood.

Thank you very, very much, Claudia.

ROSETT: Yes.

CAVUTO: Good perspective on all of this.

Then there is the oil factor and the gas factor. Are you prepared to go to the pump and pay more because of this?

After this.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

CAVUTO: All right, oil actually going down today.

That`s a supply issue. There is a lot more supply out there than was earlier thought. It could be disrupted by these Saudi developments, if they pull some supply and all of a sudden you change the math on this.

But it`s a remarkable kind of turnaround amid earlier fears that we were going to see oil prices spike, in light of what`s going on in the oil kingdom.

We have got Susan Li of Fox Business Network. We have got oil watcher Phil Flynn as well.

Susan, what happened?

SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, today, we had the safety trade on.

So it looks like Treasury yields actually dipped a bit, because people were looking to get into the safety of U.S. bonds once again, and also utilities, which is, yes, a defensive play, because you get a lot of yields on a lot of these names, and people were rotating money into those and selling out of tech.

CAVUTO: All right, Phil Flynn, a very subdued reaction in the end from the oil market.

So if there that skittishness that typically comes with this, and people are fearing higher gas prices, we didn`t see any of it. Why not?

PHIL FLYNN, PRICE FUTURES GROUP: We did.

And it`s the calm before the storm, potentially, mainly because of what Susan said, weakness in the stock market, concerns that maybe this brouhaha with Saudi Arabia could hurt demand, and it could be bearish.

Initially, Neil, when this story broke, most analysts said, hey, this is going to be bearish for oil, because Saudi Arabia is going to want to make nice with the U.S., pump a lot of oil.

But if it goes the other direction and they get really tough sanctions from the U.S., it could go the other way, and that`s when you will see oil spike.

CAVUTO: On that thought, Phil -- and I will take this up with you as well, Susan, but first Phil.

LI: Yes.

CAVUTO: The New York Times is reporting tonight that Saudi Arabia is considering blaming a top intelligence official close to Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, for the killing of Khashoggi, and that might be sort of saying, all right, it`s not on the prince, it`s on this guy.

What do you think?

FLYNN: Well, I mean, that`s going to be to their advantage, because MBS is really the face behind the Saudi economy. He`s the man that`s created the Saudi Vision 2030 to modernize the economy. He`s the guy that talked about this huge Saudi IPO, which potentially was going to be the biggest IPO in the history of the world.

CAVUTO: You`re talking about Aramco, this energy...

(CROSSTALK)

FLYNN: Aramco, Saudi Aramco.

And if the market or the people don`t believe that -- that this intelligence guy is the bad guy, and Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, is, that could be all off the table.

CAVUTO: Well, obviously, we`re talking about Mohammed bin Salman, but I`m telling you, Susan Li, I don`t know if that will wash with a world that has serious suspicions...

LI: Yes.

CAVUTO: ... this is going to be reacted to correctly by the Saudis. But your thoughts?

LI: I think sentiment is so fragile right now, just from the global effect.

You had a huge sell-off in China last night. Italian bond yields have spiked the highest in four-and-a-half years.

CAVUTO: Right.

LI: I think investors and traders are using any excuse to take money off the table right now. So any admission of guilt, I think, will be a negative for the markets.

CAVUTO: You know what`s interesting about that, Susan? We used to ignore these foreign developments. Now we get wrapped up in them. We are the world now. And it used to be us despite the world.

LI: Right. That has completely changed. Obviously, it`s a globalized world. Dollar here means a dollar there.

And, as you know, that means trades also go across borders as well. Selling, buying, it has to be an equal equation, right?

CAVUTO: You`re right about that.

Phil, I guess it`s all how this sort of lands in the markets and how they react to these developments, Saudi Arabia, by extension, China. How do you think it`s all going to go?

FLYNN: Well, I think, if the Saudis get angry about this, and it goes the other way, remember, Neil, we`re going to be putting sanctions on Iranian oil in a couple of weeks.

We`re looking to Saudi Arabia to make up that difference. If they decide that they`re not going to or they make a half-hearted attempt, then you better watch out. These oil prices could really spike.

CAVUTO: All right, guys, I want to thank you both very much.

The president is en route to Montana, a big political rally. He says that things are going well, try not to pay attention to all this other stuff, the fundamentals in the economy, the markets, all of that going just fine - - after this.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

CAVUTO: All right, the president is on his way to Montana for a big campaign event tonight.

Peter Doocy is already there.

Talk about a day, a backdrop of big news events, Peter.

PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And I just had a chance to ask Senator Jon Tester about the president`s taught on Twitter concerning Tester`s role in helping to tank Ronny Jackson as the president`s VA nominee a couple months ago.

The president wrote this. He said: ""Ever since his vicious and totally false statements about Admiral Ron Jackson, the highly respected White House doctor for Obama, Bush and me, Senator John"" -- it should say J-O-N - - ""Tester looks to be in big trouble in this great state of Montana. He behaved worse than the Democrat mob did with Justice K.""

But Tester told me, it wasn`t him.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. JON TESTER, D-MONT.: I didn`t see the president`s tweet, but I didn`t make those statements.

Those -- those were accusations that came from military people, both active military and retired. And he withdrew his name from -- his -- from the nomination process after those accusations were made.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

DOOCY: Tester said today he wants to leave the Ronny Jackson saga in the past, so he can focus on the future and the current VA secretary, Robert Wilkie, who he voted for.

But Matt Rosendale isn`t ready to let it go. And he now says the Tester`s treatment of Ronny Jackson gave Democrats a road map to disrupt the Kavanaugh proceedings month later.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MATT ROSENDALE, R-MONTANA SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: Jon Tester came out several months ago and performed the same type of character assassination on Ronny Jackson.

And so he invented this -- this smear tactic that the Washington Democrats are using. And Dianne Feinstein perfected it when she came out and performed her character assassination on Judge Kavanaugh.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

DOOCY: So Republicans are really counting on talk about Ronny Jackson motivating midterm voters here in Montana, a state where one out of every 10 residence is either an active-duty member of the military or a veteran - - Neil.

CAVUTO: All right, Peter Doocy, thank you very, very much, my friend.

Well, what if I told you, that report notwithstanding, it is not an issue for a lot of voters? A FOX News fall out today that seems to show the biggest worry for voters right now is health care. And one of the things that they have been riding very hard and high on, and that is taxes, dead last in that.

Well, one of my next guests, Antjuan Seawright, the Democratic strategist, said that, and a lot of people were laughing at him.

I don`t know if I was laughing at him, but I snickered. I`m not snickering now.

Shelby Holliday of The Wall Street Journal, Ned Ryun, the American Majority CEO.

So, Antjuan, if this poll is right -- and, remember, I put more credence in it than you -- but if...

(LAUGHTER)

CAVUTO: I`m kidding.

(LAUGHTER)

CAVUTO: But, if it`s right, that could be bad news for Republicans.

ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Neil, as you know, I have been the one voice on the Cavuto choir singing this song for a very long time, health care would be the issue that impacts voters the most come Election Day November 6.

And I said this yesterday to you, and I will say it again today. Quality of life issues are going to run the day for the midterms. You see Republicans running around...

(CROSSTALK)

CAVUTO: Well, it was the cost of health care, more to the point, right?

So Republicans have said the cost is high because Democrats screwed up with Obamacare. But it doesn`t matter, right?

SEAWRIGHT: But, Neil, the bottom line is, the Republicans have done everything they can to repeal and -- quote, unquote -- ""replace Obamacare.""

Now we see these record high numbers about how popular Obamacare is. And I`m so thankful that President Obama did care enough to give us a health care plan that wasn`t perfect by the least bit, but it was a road map to continue to work upon. The Republicans have tried to repeal it

And now here we are. They`re committing political suicide.

(CROSSTALK)

CAVUTO: I`m sorry.

Ned, you`re shaking your head. I mean, did it help or hurt for Mitch McConnell to come out yesterday and say, we get another crack at this, we`re going to try to repeal it?

NED RYUN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN MAJORITY: Well, first of all, I think Democrats are completely misreading this poll.

If you look at question 23 on that poll, Neil, it`s still the number one issue, health care is, but only 13 percent of likely voters said it`s the one issue that`s going to motivate them to come vote in the midterms.

You look at question 36, the reason that health care is the number one issue for 65 percent of the respondents is affordability. It`s about cost.

SEAWRIGHT: That`s right.

RYUN: Obamacare drove up costs.

And, Neil, the response -- Democrats` response to this, hey, let`s have Medicare for all, let`s socialize medicine...

SEAWRIGHT: That`s not true.

RYUN: ... which will cost $32 trillion over 10 years.

The last -- the last thing about that, the reason that health care is the number one issue for 40 percent of respondents is because they are extremely concerned about government takeover of the health care industry.

If Republicans keep Congress, they need to come back. They need to start implementing policies that bring about pricing transparency. I have been writing about this, Neil. I think they bring about pricing transparency and drive down costs.

(CROSSTALK)

CAVUTO: We get into pricing transparency. And you might be right there, by making sure the drug companies let us know where -- where the drugs are.

RYUN: Nonprofit hospitals.

CAVUTO: All right, that`s fine.

But the president tweeted on this earlier today, Shelby, saying that: ""All Republicans support people with preexisting conditions. And if they don`t, they will after I speak to them.""

(LAUGHTER)

CAVUTO: ""I`m in total support.""

(LAUGHTER)

CAVUTO: ""Also, Democrats will destroy your Medicare. And I will keep it healthy and well.""

What do you think of that?

SHELBY HOLLIDAY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, he`s trying to stay on message, apparently.

But I think both sides care about this issue for different reasons. Cost is a big concern. Preexisting conditions are a major concern.

CAVUTO: Right.

HOLLIDAY: When you step back and look at all polls across the board, health care is a very top priority for voters.

One thing that is concerning for Republicans is that women on both sides of the aisle care more about keeping those protections for preexisting conditions. And women, as we hear time and time again, are going to be a big swing vote in this election.

And that sort of shows you the risk of taking a vote on health care back in 2017, when it was unknown how that vote would go. And now you have a lot of Republicans on the record voting for a bill that would essentially roll back some of those protections for preexisting conditions.

That is what people are talking about. And you can debate the merits of Obamacare, but I`m not hearing voters say, we love every aspect of Obamacare. I`m certainly not hearing voters say, we love the higher premiums and the high costs.

But they are saying, we like the fact that preexisting conditions are protected.

And that`s -- Democrats have done a very good job of making that a big issue here.

CAVUTO: All right, Antjuan, real quick on that? Real quick reaction to that?

SEAWRIGHT: Neil, I`m waiting for the day for Republicans to cut their ad to say, you know what, vote for us because we`re going to protect Obamacare.

You know what? Because they have been doing the opposite the entire time since President Trump took office. And the bottom line is, they have blood on their hands for their failure on this issue of health care.

CAVUTO: Oh, now, Antjuan.

RYUN: That`s absurd.

CAVUTO: See, now you`re getting just silly. Now you`re getting silly.

RYUN: That`s absurd.

HOLLIDAY: I`m never going to say that.

CAVUTO: The blood on their hands. This is when it just goes off the rails.

RYUN: Come on.

CAVUTO: All right, I`m sick of this. I`m now sick of it.

No, I`m kidding. We are coming to a break here.

(LAUGHTER)

CAVUTO: All right, when we come back here, we`re going to get the consequences of what the president plans to do, in light of the fact that the Saudis seem to be behind this attack on this journalist.

We don`t know the degree of that response and what the president discovered that is warranting this response.

Stay with us.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

CAVUTO: All right, the crown prince and what he knew and didn`t know.

Clearly, we have discovered and the White House has discovered and the president has discovered more than he is admitting. What`s in store and the impact -- next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

QUESTION: What are you considering for possible consequences for Saudi...

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: Well, it will have to be very severe. I mean, it`s bad, bad stuff, but we will see what happens.

OK? Thank you.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CAVUTO: OK, what is that bad stuff? What is the president hinting at? And how soon can we expect some clarity on this, and then how the Saudis respond to all of this?

Benjamin Hall is in Istanbul on this investigation and where it is still going -- Benjamin.

BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, hi, Neil.

Well, we talk about an investigation. It seems like, for the last two weeks, we have had one investigation. And that`s been run by the Turks. They have been really thing CCTV images, leaked recordings from the consulate.

Now we seem to be getting that second investigation run by the Saudis, only over the last couple of days or so, since Secretary Pompeo visited Riyadh. And what we`re hearing from them, their tactic at the moment seems to be looking for holes inside the Turkish narrative, holes in their timeline.

Here in Turkey, at least for today, investigators finally finished a search of both the consul general`s residence and a secondary search of the consulate. Turkey continue to claim that they have evidence which proves Khashoggi was killed inside, but they have not yet released that hard evidence.

Now, from the Turkish point of view, there is growing focus on one man, claims to be Saudi intelligence. His name is Maher Mutreb. And he`d been seen pictured in the entourage of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a few different countries, part of the same international tour.

And now new CCTV stills released by Turkey puts him at the consulate the day of Khashoggi`s disappearance, apparently entering shortly before Khashoggi, another tie to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

As for the Saudi investigation, well, that has now picked up pace following Secretary Pompeo`s visit. I`m told that the men who were named by Turkey have now been interrogated in Saudi Arabia, and that some deny having been anywhere near Turkey.

In fact, according to Saudi media, one claims have been in New York at the time, and another died a couple of years ago.

One other new name is emerging too, General Ahmed al-Assiri. He previously served as the spokesman for the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen. He`s a V.P. of the Saudi intelligence service. And now there are reports he may have been the man who ordered the interrogation on Khashoggi.

And that would feed into the narrative which Saudi Arabia has been considering for a few days, that this was an interrogation gone wrong, that it may have been sanctioned by Mohammed bin Salman himself, but certainly there was no intent to kill him, that the intention was to rendition him.

That may be the story we see coming out of Saudi Arabia in the coming days, but for now at least, the narrative being controlled by the Turkish side -- Neil.

CAVUTO: Interesting. Very interesting, Benjamin Hall.

All right, if that`s the case, that it was an interrogation gone wrong, and it`s not on the prince, it`s on a top intelligence official, is that enough to make this thing go away or just reignite?

After this.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

CAVUTO: All right. So, who do you believe?

It`s going down like this in Saudi Arabia, that the crown prince is going to pin it, or at least the royal family, on a top intelligence official about an interrogation of this Washington Post communist that went horribly awry, and it`s not on the prince, it`s on the intelligence guy.

Is that good enough to sort of get things on and back to normal, whatever that is?

Former FBI Special Agent Chad Jenkins.

Chad, the only problem with that narrative, I guess is, it`s the Saudis investigating themselves and then reporting their findings. Your thoughts?

CHAD JENKINS, FORMER FBI SPECIAL AGENT: Yes, we should let them be a scapegoat in this and just wash it under the table.

Obviously, when a journalist from The Washington Post is murdered inside a consulate, we have to have a just system, for international purposes, to protect journalists and why they`re -- what they do.

So we cannot just allow this to go swept under the rug. And a fear of mine is that we`re going to let them off the hook because now we`re proclaiming that the Saudis are such a great alliance to the United States in the global war on terrorism. And I have serious reservations about making such a strong statement in defense of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

CAVUTO: You know, and I have a problem too -- and you`re the expert here, Chad -- but trusting the Turks, who have a vested contempt for the Saudis, and, of course, are certainly no friends to journalists or protesters or dissidents themselves.

And they`re the ones giving us a lot of the information that news organizations have quoted. I guess I`m back to what a reporter once asked the president back in the Oval Office a couple of days back. Should, could an FBI person be dispatched to sort of help with an investigation to calm our doubts?

Or is that our purview, especially since Khashoggi wasn`t a U.S. citizen? Your thoughts?

JENKINS: I think, with the tie to The Washington Post, we absolutely should have the FBI investigating, from the legal attaches either in Ankara or in Istanbul.

We already have FBI agents, analysts, support personnel there. There`s already working relationships through other means, other investigations, other just open international liaison purposes. So we could definitely use those resources to get the bottom of this and try to find what the truth is, because you`re absolutely right.

We`re looking at Turkey, looking at Saudi Arabia. Where does the truth lie? Well, let`s use our own intelligence and investigators to try to narrow that down and find out, so that we can use it for intelligence purposes on the global scale and then also bring it to justice on the -- on the scale for the journalist as well and his family.

CAVUTO: Well said. Chad Jenkins, thank you very, very much.

JENKINS: Thanks, Neil.

CAVUTO: All right.

And then there`s the issue of the caravan coming our way, all illegal immigrants, and Mexico apparently doing little to stop them. What do we do?

After this.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

CAVUTO: All right, the caravan is coming on, working its way through Central American, up through Mexico.

And we are concerned that this thousands-person-strong caravan -- and hard to quantify those numbers or make sure that they are what they are touted to be -- well, the Mexicans are going to let them march right through.

Then they get up to the border. They`re processed. And many of them sneak into this country. You have heard that again and again. But a lot of folks are saying that it comes at the worst of times and indicates a pattern of behavior that Mexico does little to stop.

Former ICE agent Claude Arnold joins us right now.

Claude Arnold, what do we know about this caravan?

CLAUDE ARNOLD, FORMER ICE SPECIAL AGENT: Well, we know that it`s -- as you said, it`s several-thousand-strong.

And it`s likely that people are being encouraged by the smuggling organizations and the news that ICE just doesn`t have detention space to detain them. So they know that likely, they get into the U.S., they`re going to be released.

CAVUTO: And what is -- if you can bring up to speed on, what is our obligation when they get to a border?

There obviously are checkpoints or points they should go. But oftentimes they bypass those, right?

ARNOLD: Right. Yes.

They don`t want to wait at a port of entry, because the port of entry is going to process a limited amount of people. So it`s advantageous for them to illegally cross the border and be apprehended. If they are family units that have minor children, they know that those children have to be released, ultimately.

And, as I stated, but, right now, ICE is running out of detention space. So these smuggling organizations get this intelligence. They know that people are being released because ICE doesn`t have detention space. And that encourages these mass migrations and these smuggling organizations to increase the amount of people they are bringing into the United States.

CAVUTO: I`m curious. When this happens, the difference now is that a new president, a far left president is coming in to office, I think in December.

Do we know where he stands on this? It`s one thing to talk to the outgoing administration, and they will just give you lip service, and then quite another to talk to the new guy who is going to run the show.

How do we play that?

ARNOLD: Well, I think you bring up an important point.

Based on the fact that the Congress has not acted to close the loopholes in the law to take away the motivator for people to come here and try and take advantage of the asylum process, there`s something else that needs to be done.

And that`s why there`s legislation pending, for example, to take money out of the remittances from these countries that are going back, take a percentage of the money, and also take a percentage of the foreign aid from these countries to fund a wall, so that this kind of behavior can be stopped.

CAVUTO: We just secured this trade deal first with Mexico, and then Canada came in. And so we presumably have very good or better relations with Mexico.

But they don`t seem to be forthcoming on at least putting out the yellow lights or slowing this caravan down. What do we do?

ARNOLD: Well, I think you have to hit them where it hurts.

And that`s financially. A huge percentage of the contributor to the GDP of Mexico is remittances going back.

CAVUTO: Right.

ARNOLD: And that goes for the Central American countries from which these people are coming.

Cut foreign aid. I mean, President Trump has already threatened that. And I think that`s what it`s going to take, because if we can`t get Congress to close the loopholes in the laws and fund building a border wall, something`s got to be done, or people will just keep coming.

CAVUTO: And they know it`s going to be tested in the media, where it`s going to look heartless. They`re trying to stop. We have got to go process all of you. And we`re going to look inhumane and all that stuff.

And you can`t win.

ARNOLD: No, you absolutely can`t win.

And, again, they know that they`re going to be released, so they`re going to continue to come, when there`s no deterrent. And it`s important to note that the asylum process is already being abused, because about 80 percent of these asylum claims end up being denied. So these are economic immigrants.

They`re coming here, understandably so, because they can make more money, have a better life here. But they`re not -- the overwhelming majority of them are not bona fide asylum claims.

CAVUTO: Yes. And life could be a lot easier if the economy in Mexico, Latin America were improved enough that they didn`t feel compelled to leave. But that is the crux of the problem, you know?

ARNOLD: Yes.

And part of problem is too that it`s not just building a wall and changing the law, but we have to have an interior enforcement strategy...

CAVUTO: Absolutely.

ARNOLD: ... that holds employers accountable, so we don`t have that magnet for the illegal immigration.

CAVUTO: Well said.

Claude, thank you very, very much.

ARNOLD: Thank you.

CAVUTO: A message for this president from past presidents -- after this.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

CAVUTO: The midterms are still 19 days away, but we already know who the president won`t be blaming if they don`t turn out well for Republicans: himself.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: If they don`t go out and vote, then they have themselves to blame.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CAVUTO: You know, last week`s crazy stock market -- forget about today`s - - is not his doing, the Fed`s doing.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: I think the Fed is out of control. I think what they`re doing is wrong.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CAVUTO: Or the budget deficit soaring 17 percent to $779 billion, not his end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Try the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.

Or discord in the White House, don`t pin it on the guy who lives there. Pin it on a lot of snakes who work for him there.

Or like the Puerto Rico hurricane recovery efforts that were all him when they were going well, then not anything to do with him when he discovered maybe they didn`t go so well.

It is human nature to shift blame, but it is second nature to this president to shift so much blame.

And now the shift has really hit the fan, because the president is shifting so fast, owning a strong stock market when it`s going his way, then pointing a finger when it is not going his way. The Fed is loco. The president is not. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is the biggest threat to this economy, not the once zero percent interest rates that candidate Trump bemoaned were being kept artificially low in that other president`s economy.

Just like it`s not the former presidents bull market, it`s his, even though it started many years earlier, before his.

It is clear, though, that markets go up and markets go down. And it is very clear that markets under Donald Trump have gone a lot more up than they have ever gone down. Touche to him.

But would it kill this president to heed the words of another president when another market was going really down?

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

RONALD REAGAN, THEN-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: All the other things I have told you about the economy are as solid as I have told you.

So, no, I have no more knowledge of why it took place than you have.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CAVUTO: You know, it`s tough to blame for something you didn`t do, but it is tougher to take a bow for something you might regret.

Just ask John Kennedy, who really could have blamed his military advisers, even his predecessor, for the Bay of Pigs fiasco, but, in the end, admitted, as president, it was his fiasco.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOHN F. KENNEDY, THEN-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There`s an old saying that victory has 100 fathers and defeat is an orphan. And I wouldn`t be surprised if information is poured into you in regard to all the recent activities.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CAVUTO: Lesson learned.

You see, the trouble with pointing fingers at others is some of those others then feel tempted to point a finger right back at you.

Why should I stick by you, if you`re only going to stick it to me?

You see, that`s the thing about loyalty. It works both ways. It takes a big man to acknowledge a mistake.

But here`s the real dirty little truth on this. Those who do almost always see a big jump in the polls, whether it was JFK and the Bay of Pigs or Ronald Reagan and Iran-Contra.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REAGAN: I take full responsibility for my own actions and for those of my administration.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CAVUTO: Or Barack Obama and his own midterm drubbing.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

QUESTION: What happened on Tuesday?

BARACK OBAMA, THEN-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We got beat.

QUESTION: Yes.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CAVUTO: Or Bill Clinton acknowledging the obvious after the Newt Gingrich Republican Revolution.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BILL CLINTON, THEN-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The era of big government is over.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CAVUTO: You see, Clinton wisely learned you can spite the parade, or maybe you can try and lead it, and so he did.

It is tough when things don`t go your way, but, Mr. President, they`re only going to get tougher when you keep putting yourself in the way.

There is nothing wrong with being human. There is everything wrong with trying to convince other humans that you are not.

So, let me put this in terms I`m sure your legions of loyal supporters will no doubt share with me right after this show -- in fact, they`re doing so now.

It would be like me blaming my being a tad overweight on a thyroid condition. Fat chance any of them would ever let me try it, because I can look in the mirror.

What I`m asking, Mr. President, can you?

Good night.

"U.S. Sen. Rand Paul is intent on blocking a $110 billion arms sale with Saudi Arabia, which he labeled as a sponsor of terrorism during a Montana rally with Donald Trump Jr. on Saturday.

Paul, R-Ky., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told a crowd in Missoula that the U.S. can no longer look away from Saudi Arabia’s bad behavior. His comments came during an event for Republican U.S. Senate candidate Matt Rosendale, the Hill reported.

“We have to think through this idea that everything is going to be blindly for Saudi Arabia. They’re involved in a war in Yemen where tens of thousands of civilians are dying,” Paul said.

The Saudis are the world’s biggest customer for U.S. military weapons and equipment, and are a key ally in the Middle East.

Paul has repeatedly called for greater scrutiny of the U.S.-Saudi relationship after U.S.-based writer Jamal Khashoggi was killed inside a Saudi consulate in Turkey on Oct. 2.

He also called for cutting off military aid to the country.

A letter sent to President Trump from both Republicans and Democrats on the committee could trigger the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which requires the administration to investigate Khashoggi’s death and report back to Congress within 120 days.

Saudi Arabia could be hit with sanctions if its government officials are found to have violated Khashoggi’s human rights.

Paul called any proposed sanctions a slap on the wrist.

“I think sanctions are a way of pretending to do something. If you sanction the 15 thugs that the crown prince sent to [the consulate in Istanbul], you’re sanctioning 15 thugs and they’ll just get 15 more thugs,” he said.

“I think sanctions are a way of pretending to do something. If you sanction the 15 thugs that the crown prince sent to [the consulate in Istanbul], you’re sanctioning 15 thugs and they’ll just get 15 more thugs.” — U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.

Instead, he is pushing for a vote to block the arms sale.

“Cutting off the arms sales will make them wake up,” Paul told the Hill before he went onstage at the rally. “In fact, their air force would be grounded in two or three months if they didn’t have spare parts.""

Earlier this month President Trump defended the arms deal as an economic boost.

“In terms of the order of $110 billion — think of that, $110 billion — all they’re going to do is give it to other countries and I think that would be very foolish of our country,” he said Oct. 13.

Trump Jr. did not mention Saudi Arabia during Saturday’s rally.

Rather than simply focus on Khashoggi, Paul is also criticizing Saudi Arabia’s support of “violent jihad,” Politico reported.

He reminded the crowd that 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in the 9/11 attacks were Saudis, and accused the kingdom of funding terror activities.

"President Trump addressed a crowd at a rally in Billings, Montana Thursday night in support of GOP congressional candidate Matt Rosendale in his quest to unseat Democratic Sen. John Tester.

Trump kicked off the rally touting the work his administration has done and briefly mentioned the ongoing Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Describing Kavanaugh as ""truly exceptional,"" Trump said he thought the nominee was ""doing really well.""

Separately, likely referring to Democrats on the committee, he said it was ""embarrassing to watch those people make fools of themselves as they scream and shout at this great gentleman.""

The president also referenced a controversial op-ed with The New York Times -- written by an anonymous ""senior official in the Trump administration"" -- and urged the publication to release the author`s name ""for the sake of our national security.""

The president`s trip to Montana came one day after the op-ed`s publishing, in which the official revealed ""that many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.""

The president also made reference at the rally to allegations released earlier this year by Tester regarding Trump`s pick to head the Department of Veteran Affairs, White House physician Ronny Jackson.

Trump said Jackson ""was subjected to horrible lies and smears.""

""What Tester did to Admiral Jackson should never, ever be allowed,"" Trump said.

Jackson ultimately withdrew his nomination to lead the department amid allegations collected by Tester’s office about his prescription-drug practices and use of alcohol.

Trump slammed Tester, accusing him of saying things to his constituents in Montana and then acting differently in Washington D.C., adding that ""he votes like he`s Nancy Pelosi.""

The president painted Democrats as weak on immigration, emphasizing the need, he said, to vote for Rosendale over Tester.

""This election is a choice between Democrats who want to abolish ICE and Republicans who want to abolish MS-13,"" Trump said.

Closing out the rally, Trump urged people in Montana to gather their friends and family in November and ""get out and vote Republican.""

Rosendale and Tester are facing off in a state Trump claimed victory in during the 2016 presidential election, winning by 20 percentage points.

When Trump visited Montana in July, Tester took out full-page ads in several newspapers welcoming the president to the state. Trump proceeded to slam Tester at a rally in Great Falls as an obstructionist who was out of touch with the state`s voters.

Tester, who on Wednesday revealed a new TV ad touting his work with Trump concerning veterans, told The Associated Press Thursday that its never “a bad thing” when a president visits Montana.

“Anytime you get a president of the United States to come to Montana, it`s certainly not a bad thing for Montana,” Tester said. “He`s going to do what he`s going to do. I just hope he uses the trip for more than political purposes, but we`ll see.”

Rosendale dismissed the idea of his opponent and Trump working together as being ""rather amusing.""

“Jon has opposed the president and he`s trying to come back here and say he`s supporting the president,” Rosendale told The Associated Press. “The president, who Jon says he`s working so well with, is going to say, ‘Jon isn`t working with me.’”

"Former President Obama gave the nation some insights into the Democratic Party’s midterm election strategy Friday with a political speech demonizing Americans who elected Donald Trump as president and doubling down on the failed liberal ideology that devastated our economy.

In a moment reminiscent of Hillary Clinton’s outrageous characterization of Trump voters as “deplorable” and “irredeemable,” President Obama said: “I have to say this … Over the past few decades, the politics of division and resentment and paranoia has unfortunately found a home in the Republican Party.”

Labeling the 63 million Trump voters as “deplorable” and “irredeemable” didn’t work out for Hillary Clinton when she ran a failed presidential campaign against Trump in 2016. Labeling the same voters as divisive, resentful and paranoid will not work for Democrats in the November midterm elections.

Democrats continually demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding and active demonization of Trump voters. They are clearly wrong but don’t realize they’re wrong.

I traveled the country in search of the Trump voter for my book, “The New American Revolution: The Making of a Populist Movement.”

Here is what I found: a mother who lost her only son to an illegal immigrant; a wife whose husband died while languishing on a waitlist for health-care from the Department of Veterans Affairs; a mom whose entire family perished in a terrorist attack; factory workers whose jobs went overseas; and so many other great Americans who wanted change – a change from the Obama presidency.

These are some of the millions of Americans who made Donald Trump our president in an election that the liberal media, pollsters, and political elite never saw coming. They never saw it coming because they never took the time to talk to voters and understand their one simple request: “change.”

As I wrote previously: “In every single one of the twenty-seven states where CNN conducted exit and entrance polls during the Republican primaries, more than 80% of the Republican electorate felt angry or dissatisfied with the federal government. In total, just shy of 90% of Republican voters overall expressed a negative view of the federal government.”

In the states where CNN asked the same question of Democrats, an average 61 percent of Democratic voters had a negative view of the federal government! Interestingly, the highest level of Democratic frustration was in the state of Michigan, where 69 percent of voters reported frustration with the federal government. Michigan, of course, voted for Trump after 30 years of going blue.

Election night exit polling once again confirmed voters’ appetite for change. Fox News 2016 exit polling found that a staggering 62 percent of voters thought the country was “seriously on the wrong track.”

In short, the story of the 2016 election was a bipartisan call for change from the failed Obama status quo. So why, then, are Democrats bringing President Obama to the campaign trail?

The Obama presidency delivered the slowest economic recovery since World War II. Economic growth languished at 2 percent each year; wage growth stalled; and the middle class shrank considerably. Perhaps it should come as no surprise then that 71 percent of Americans believed the economy was rigged against them.

In just two years, President Trump completely reversed course.

Now, 85 percent of blue collar workers say their lives are “heading in the right direction,” and 62 percent of voters overall say the economy is “good” or “excellent.” The Trump economy has delivered 4.2 percent annualized economic growth in the second quarter; 3.6 million new jobs; and wages growing at the fastest pace in a decade.

Now, President Obama is desperately trying to take credit for President Trump’s successes, saying “remember when this recovery started” while conveniently failing to note the Obama recovery was the worst since World War II, costing Americans approximately $17,000 in wage growth.

Make no mistake. The windfall of good economic news is precisely because of the Trump presidency reversing Obama’s legacy of high taxes, onerous regulation and job-killing trade deals. It’s why “Economists Credit Trump as Tailwind for U.S. Growth, Hiring and Stocks,” according to a Wall Street Journal survey.

Returning to the status quo political class that oversaw a failing economy is not the answer for Democrats. Sending Obama out on the campaign trail forces every single red state Democrat to defend the failures of the Obama presidency.

Obama’s presence poses quite a challenge for Democrats like North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp and Montana Sen. Jon Tester, who pose as Trump allies while saying Obama will not be welcome to their states.

Obama’s disastrous liberal agenda was rejected in 2016, and it must be rejected in 2018. While Obama, Hillary Clinton and the Democrats ignored the forgotten men and women of this country, President Trump spoke to them. Now, he is acting for them."," Obama tries to demonize Trump voters, following Hillary`s losing strategy ",9-2018
"The failing New York Times confirmed the existence of the Deep State by publishing an anonymous op-ed Wednesday headlined “I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration.”’

As usual, The Times was late in acknowledging the reality of individuals employed by the U.S. government who are actively working against the will of the people and America’s duly elected president.

Once dismissed as a conspiracy theory by the biased liberal media, the Deep State is now exposed for all to see. All Americans should be concerned – particularly the 62 million people who voted for Donald J. Trump for president in 2016.

The people spoke loudly and clearly in November 2016 and they chose President Trump – the ultimate political outsider – to confront the failed Washington status quo and shake it up.

The rise of the dangerous and unaccountable Deep State is a reaction to Trump and his highly successful America First agenda, which could not have been accomplished with business as usual.

The president recently tweeted: “I’m draining the Swamp, and the Swamp is trying to fight back. Don’t worry, we will win!” He’s perfectly on point; swamp creatures don’t like change.

We don’t yet know the motives of the anonymous op-ed writer, who received not one vote at the ballot box, so we can only speculate for now.

The writer clearly yearns for more of the broken status quo policies of the past; the politically correct governing that steered us over the financial cliff in 2008 and paved the way for Barack Obama and our exploding $21 trillion national debt a decade later. The individual in question and other faceless bureaucrats will get smoked out of their cowardly holes before long.

If the “senior administration official” who penned the op-ed turns out to be a low-level actor, The New York Times should go out of business. Regardless, the political grandstanding will backfire because the American people recognize deceit when they see it.

This op-ed is the work of an elitist who doesn’t understand the American people or why they voted for Donald Trump in the first place – just like the New York Times.

To be sure, the actions outlined in this pathetic op-ed are just the rallying cry Trump voters and other outraged Americans need to send yet another message to the desperate defenders of the corrupt and broken Washington establishment in the midterm elections in November.

President Trump spoke in Montana Thursday to rally voters around our tremendous Republican U.S. Senate candidate Matt Rosendale to defeat Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, who is a puppet of Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

The president should educate the American people that Deep State thugs are being paid taxpayer- funded salaries to work against the will of the people! It’s the height of arrogance burrowed in our federal government.

America is exceptional because we have a government ""of the people, by the people, for the people,” in the words Abraham Lincoln, our 16th president. This destructive behavior by the unelected bureaucracy cannot stand.

The people must act and on Election Day Nov. 6 they’ll have their opportunity.

Some 40 million Americans voted for a Republican for the House of Representatives in the last midterm election in 2014. We must do better in 2018 because we can’t let bad actors in the Deep State win. If House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., becomes speaker of the House again in 2019, the swamp will prosper and the Trump agenda will be dead.

Reforming a broken Washington is a healthy and entirely necessary endeavor. President Trump is taking on powerful entrenched interests across the board in his own way and winning the battles one by one.

Trump supporters should thank the president for his herculean efforts and turn out in numbers like it’s a presidential election year because the swamp isn’t drained yet. President Trump isn’t on the ballot but his America First agenda and historic accomplishments are. Vote like it!", Anonymous NY Times op-ed shows Deep State thugs are working against the will of the American people ,9-2018
"For Republicans to win in the midterm elections, they must understand – and make clear to the American people – that Nov. 6 will be a big-choice election, when voters will decide between two competing alternative universes.

If Republicans maintain – or even grow – their majorities in the House and the Senate, America will be operating in a grassroots rebellion-conservative-Republican universe.

That will mean that progress on President Trump’s agenda will continue (and possibly accelerate). More conservative judges will join the federal bench. Our taxes and unemployment figures will remain low, while our jobs numbers, wages and economic growth will continue to increase.

In additions, Republican majorities in both houses will ensure that our borders will be secure, our military will be strong, and our nation will prosper through free, fair and reciprocal trade practices.

If Democrats are able to take the House and gain seats in the Senate, we will be in the media-left-Democratic Party universe. These groups will oppose every Trump-Republican plan that is proposed – and likely try to impeach the president at the first frivolous opportunity.

Every day will be dominated by scandals and defined by identity politics. Nominated judges will sit in limbo as the federal court caseload builds – delaying justice and fair trials for many. Democrats will raise our taxes and reverse the economic gains of the Trump administration – causing unemployment to rise and our economy to stagnate.

I describe this concept in-depth in a political strategy paper I wrote called “The Republican Choice for 2018: Win or Lose.” I wrote this paper because I truly believe every Republican candidate, campaign manager, consultant and political committee member must understand and communicate the stakes of this election. As I explain in the paper:

“A big choice alternative universe campaign requires thinking, planning, and training to make the transition from ‘politics as usual’ to ‘politics as history.’ It is also the only path that will keep a Republican majority in the House.

“The current pattern is a war of district-by-district attrition. The consultants and professionals believe Republicans can outspend Democrats one district at a time and use traditional attack tactics to overcome them even in an unfavorable environment.

“This explains the number of Nancy Pelosi attack ads and the relatively few big picture, big choice ads. It also explains the constant search for personal weaknesses (DUIs, past business deals, etc.). However, in a potential wave election, this kind of district-by-district effort simply gets drowned by the national messages (see 1974, 1980, 1994, 2006, and 2010 for examples).

“Republicans must move from district-by-district attrition to a national message – and do something unexpected. Republicans need a national brand campaign, so Americans actually hear that there are more jobs than unemployed, we have the lowest level of African-American unemployment recorded, the average American family will have $2,000 more in their budgets, retirement savings have increased, wages have gone up, etc.

“In order to define a big choice, we must ensure that people believe the choice we are defining is real. Right now, there is a lack of belief in many of the accomplishments that have been made.

“We need to be defining the value proposition of the Republican Party to the electorate, so we can break from patterns of the past and propose a compelling future.”

President Trump has already intuited that this is a big-choice election, and he has begun using language that defines the two universes from which voters will have to choose.

You saw several examples of this while President Trump was campaigning in Montana last week for Republican Senate candidate Matt Rosendale, who is seeking to take Democratic Sen. Jon Tester’s seat.

Most pointedly, President Trump defined the immigration fight in clear, big-choice terms.

“This election is a choice between Democrats who want to abolish ICE, and Republicans, who want to abolish MS-13,” the president said. “It is very simple.”

President Trump – and every Republican – should continue thinking in these big-choice alternative universe terms.

"We’re taking all bets – put your money down now: Will Republicans hold their U.S. Senate majority after the Nov. 6 midterm elections? My bet is that they do. But the odds that I’m wrong keep going up.

Ever the master of the political expectations game, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., wouldn’t answer “yes” or “no” when asked this week if he thinks his party will hold the Senate come November.

Instead, McConnell said the midterms are going to be “very challenging” for his party and then added that Senate races have turned into “a knife fight in an alley!”

If you believe McConnell, there are “dead even” Senate races taking place in Arizona, Nevada, Tennessee, Montana, North Dakota, Missouri, Indiana, West Virginia and Florida.

“It`s just a brawl in every one of those places,"" McConnell said.

Even if McConnell is spinning to get bigger campaign contributions for his candidates, there is a real question here. Do the Democrats really do have a shot at taking back control of the Senate when voters go to the polls?

It wasn’t that long ago when a Democratic takeover of the upper chamber seemed pie-in-the-sky unlikely. But with less than eight weeks to go before Election Day, things really do seem to be breaking the Democrats’ way.

How did we get here? The Democrats, after all, are still defending 24 seats – including 10 in states that Donald Trump carried in 2016.

To my mind, the tide turned with the surprise victory of Democrat Doug Jones in the special election to fill the Senate seat from Alabama formerly held by Republican Jeff Sessions, who is now attorney general. Republicans now hold a 51-49 Senate majority because they lost that seat.

Moreover, the Jones victory re-energized a Democratic base still depressed over Trump’s victory in the 2016 presidential election. It also showed how a credible, moderate Democrat could overtake a flawed Republican candidate even in the reddest of red states.

Democratic senators once thought to be headed for political death are now somehow full of new life.

Indiana’s Joe Donnelly, West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, Montana’s Jon Tester, North Dakota’s Heidi Heitkamp and Missouri’s Claire McCaskill are all polling ahead or within the margin of error of their Republican opponents, according to the latest Real Clear Politics averages.

At this juncture, what once seemed like a sure thing has turned into a question mark. That means the GOP is spending time, money and resources in places once thought to require no attention to win.

In short, the GOP is now playing defense rather than offense to protect its incumbents. Republicans are defending a president with historically low approval ratings and combatting the daily drip-drip-drip of negative headlines about him.

The negative headlines deal with stories about hush-money payments to women who claim they had affairs with Trump (claims he denies); guilty verdicts against former Trump advisers investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller; and best-selling books accusing the president of corruption, having a limited intellect, and suffering from mental instability. President Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and attacked negative books about his presidency as fiction.

The Democrats need to pick up only two seats to win control of the Senate. Here are four races where they could do it:

Tennessee

Popular former Democratic Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen is polling within three points with his Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, according to a Fox News poll released Wednesday. Blackburn’s 47-44 percent lead is within the poll’s margin of error.

Bredesen is focusing on his own moderate, center-right record as governor and vowing to work in a bipartisan manner in the best interests of his state. He is avoiding mentioning President Trump.

By contrast, Blackburn has become Trump’s most outspoken female supporter in Congress. She is a frequent guest on cable news shows, talk radio and conservative media. The fact that she has not been able to pull ahead of Bredesen in a state that Trump won by 26 points has Republicans nervous, for good reason.

Texas

Texas is the biggest surprise on the midterm horizon. And it is forcing establishment Republicans in Washington to hold their noses and try to save one of their party’s biggest in-house headaches – Sen. Ted Cruz.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., once famously remarked if you killed Cruz on the floor of the Senate and had a trial with only his fellow senators serving as jurors, nobody would vote to convict his killer.

During the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Trump branded Cruz “Lyin’ Ted” and suggested the senator’s father could have been involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

But Cruz has remained a supporter and reliable vote for President Trump in the Senate. His Democratic opponent in his re-election race – U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of El Paso – is getting a ton of national media exposure and reported an impressive fundraising haul earlier this month.

Texas Sen. John Cornyn told Politico that Cruz is in a tight race, explaining that “we’re not bluffing, this is real, and it is a serious threat.” Real Clear Politics shows Cruz leading O’Rourke by just three points in polling.

Nevada

Republican Sen. Dean Heller is running for re-election in a state that went for Hillary Clinton and elected a Democratic Latina to the U.S. Senate in 2016.

Heller tries to portray himself as a moderate on immigration issues. But his association with President Trump and the party of “build the wall” is doing him no favors in a state with a 28 percent Hispanic population.

Heller’s opponent – popular Democratic U.S. Rep. Jacky Rosen – is leading by one point according to a Suffolk University poll last week. The political machine of former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and the strong political influence of unionized workers in Las Vegas and Reno will make it very difficult for Heller to hold on.

Arizona

The Republican Senate candidate, U.S. Rep. Martha McSally, survived a brutal GOP primary against firebrands former Sheriff Joe Arpaio and hard-right former state Sen. Kelli Ward. Polls show McSally tied with a popular, moderate Democratic U.S. Rep. Krysten Sinema.

Trump carried Arizona by less than four points in 2016, down from the nine-point margin of victory for Republican Mitt Romney over President Obama in 2012. This is a seat now held by Republican Sen. Jeff Flake – a stand-out GOP critic of Trump – who is retiring from Congress to avoid having to run as a critic of his party’s troubled leader.

For two years, the question in Washington has been: “What will it take for Republicans to turn on Donald Trump?”

"Two incumbent red-state Democratic senators who have been the targets of some of President Trump`s ire are facing increasingly tough odds to win re-election in November, a new poll shows, underscoring the challenges Democrats face in their bid to retake the Senate in November -- as well as Trump`s continuing presence in key battleground states.

Montana Sen. Jon Tester and Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill are locked in dead heats with their Republican challengers, according to the CBS News poll, with Tester leading Matt Rosendale by only two percentage points and McCaskill tied with Josh Hawley at 45 percent. Both results are firmly within the polls` margins of error, which are 5.2 and 3.3 percentage points respectively.

The results echoed the findings of a Fox News poll last week, showing McCaskill leading by only a whisker. Republicans hold a narrow 51-49 majority in the Senate, and because Vice President Mike Pence could break any potential 50-50 ties, Democrats need to take two seats to seize control of the chamber.

WATCH: TRUMP RIBS MONTANA VOTERS ABOUT TESTER, ASKS `HOW DID HE GET ELECTED?`

But where polls have shown increasing prospects that Democrats may regain control of the House of Representatives, their chances in the Senate have always been lower, owing to the smaller number of seats on the ballot and Trump`s popularity in key states that are holding Senate elections.

Trump has endorsed both Rosendale and Hawley, and plans to attend a rally for Hawley in Missouri this week. The president won both Montana and Missouri by double-digits in the 2016 presidential election, and he has made no secret of his disdain for both Tester and McCaskill, mocking them as ""very dishonest"" and ""phony,"" respectively.

This past April, Trump called for Tester to resign after the White House issued a report disputing his allegations against the president`s pick for the next secretary of Veterans Affairs, Ronny Jackson.

""Jon Tester doesn`t share your values,"" Trump said at a July rally in Montana. ""He showed his true colors with his shameful, dishonest attacks on a great man -- a friend of mine.""

Trump called Rosendale a ""really good man"" and said it is time that Big Sky Country ""retire liberal Democrat Jon Tester.""

Tester responded: ""It`s my duty to make sure Montana veterans get what they need and have earned, and I`ll never stop fighting for them as their senator.""

Outside groups, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), have heeded Trump`s call to oust Tester and have funneled advertising money into the state. But they voiced concern initially that Tester`s rival had limited name recognition.

“Senator Tester has obstructed President Trump at every turn and now he’s paying the price,” Calvin Moore, a spokesman for the NRSC, told Fox News this summer. “These developments really nuke his campaign strategy of trying to cozy up to President Trump, when all he’s really done has been to obstruct, obstruct, obstruct.”

As for McCaskill, Trump tweeted in June that she was ""so phony"" for using a private plane for two of the three days of her supposed campaign RV tour.

""Senator Claire McCaskill of the GREAT State of Missouri flew around in a luxurious private jet during her RV tour of the state,"" Trump wrote. ""RV’s are not for her. People are really upset, so phony! Josh Hawley should win big, and has my full endorsement.""

For her part, McCaskill acknowledged that she had used a private plane, but insisted she had not used office funds and made no apologies for taking trips to see her constituents.

""I added some stops with the use of the plane, but I was on the RV so much that the broken drawer drove me crazy.""

Trump`s popularity and endorsements have been key factors in several races this midterm season, including pivotal contests in Ohio, South Carolina, Georgia and elsewhere.

"A poster for a recent Pearl Jam concert has sparked outrage for depicting the corpse of President Donald Trump.

The band staged a concert to get fans to vote for Democratic Sen. Jon Tester on Monday. To promote the show, bassist Jeff Ament and artist Bobby Draws Skullz drew up some artwork that included graphic imagery of the White House on fire and the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial cracked and breaking.

The artwork also included an image of the corpse of Trump being picked at by a bald eagle while it reaches for a briefcase that appears to have the communist hammer and sickle emblem on it.



In the photo, Sen. Tester is flying above the fray on a tractor while his opponent, Montana Senate Republican candidate Matt Rosendale, is depicted with a lobster claw and holding a sign that reads “Maryland.”

The band shared the poster on its official Instagram page along with a note to fans from Ament endorsing Tester.

“We’re at a tipping point and its [sic] time for action. Jon Tester is the real deal and nobody cares more about our country and especially Montana,” it reads.

Rosendale decried the poster in a statement to Fox News saying, “Once again, Jon Tester has shown he will stand with the far-left over Montanans. This poster from Pearl Jam is disgusting and reprehensible. It depicts a dead President Trump and a burning White House. It’s time for Jon Tester to denounce this act of violence and blatant display of extremism.”

Representatives for Tester did not immediately responded to Fox News’ request for comment.

Fans were quick to express their outrage at the band’s graphic imagery.

“Used to be one of my favorite band and I always knew you guys were a little far left, but this takes it to a whole new level,” one commenter wrote. “I never realized you supported hatred and violence, always thought you were about love and peace.

"Longtime Democratic Rep. Alcee Hastings drew big laughs at a political rally Sunday when he cracked a joke about President Trump drowning in the Potomac River.

The Florida congressman was speaking at a “Stronger Together” Democratic event and underscored some of his Trump warnings by relaying a joke he heard from the son of a former state lawmaker.

It went like this:

“Do you know the difference between a crisis and a catastrophe? … A crisis is if Donald Trump falls into the Potomac River and can’t swim … a catastrophe is anybody saves his a--.”

The story of the joke was met with uproarious laughter and applause – and also uploaded to YouTube.

As reported by the Sen Sentinel, Hastings also said at the rally that “something is tragically wrong” with Trump and quipped that if Special Counsel Robert Mueller doesn’t bring down Trump, “Omarosa will” – in reference to the fired White House aide and reality TV star now shopping her tell-all memoir on her time with the Trump White House and campaign.

The Florida event reportedly was attended by four Democratic gubernatorial candidates as well as Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla.

This is not the first time Hastings has expressed his contempt for Trump in off-color terms. The Sun Sentinel noted in 2016, he called Trump a “sentient pile of excrement.”

Jokes about physical harm to Trump also have become increasingly common.

With just seven primaries left in 2018 we look forward to soon being able to retire – for the time being, at least – from our work of reminding you that candidates count.

It is only too easy to look at elections as marshalled armies of data points arrayed against each other on the ballot box battlefield. Thirty-seven percent of whosits voting at a greater intensity than 41 percent of whatsits, etc.

This version lets both voters and politicians off too easily and unreasonably reduces the importance of quality candidates. The numbers of whosits and the intensity of the whatsits really does depend on who is running. This week’s changes to the Fox News Power Rankings tell that tale quite clearly.

We’re looking at the Senate this week, so first some context is in order. You can click here to see how things stand, but the short version goes like this: Democrats would need to gain two seats to take control of the Senate. There are 36 seats up for grabs this year, but for now only 11 appear to be competitive in any real sense. Of those, Democrats currently control seven and Republicans control four.

For Democrats to take the Senate they need to win nine of the 11 most hotly contested races. So you can see why even in a tough year for the GOP, Republicans remain bullish on their chances to actually expand their narrow majority.

Doing so would be a lot easier, however, if the Red Team can find a way to not give back any seats.

Republicans could take a good step in that direction on Tuesday in Arizona. Republican Sen. Jeff Flake is retiring and his departure touched off what at the outset looked to be one of the worst primary battles of 2018.

Rep. Martha McSally has the backing of the GOP establishment and has shown prodigious fundraising abilities and solid political skills in a state where maverick-y voters tend to defy conventional political definitions. Unfortunately for her, McSally drew former state lawmaker Kelli Ward as her principal primary foe.

Ward gained national attention in 2016 when she tried to unseat Sen. John McCain. She fell short after a nasty race, but demonstrated her powerful connection to the large contingent of Arizona populist nationalists of the Trump variety.

But McSally has caught a couple of breaks. First was the candidacy of former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, recipient of a preemptive pardon from President Trump and a hero to immigration hardliners. Arpaio’s entry meant Ward had to cover her own right flank rather than focusing on McSally. McSally’s other good fortune was that the Trump movement and the president himself opted to stay out of the race all together.

The vote may be Tuesday, but we could have probably declared the race as good as over last week when Ward, who has trailed in every public poll taken since April, invited a notorious figure from the 2016 election – one of the principal abettors of a conspiracy theory which held that Democrats were raping children in the basement of a Washington pizza restaurant – on her bus tour.

Ugh.

For some time it appeared that McSally might go too far in kowtowing to the populist nationalists, but she has mostly kept it together, and looks poised to cruise on Tuesday. That’s bad news for Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema who has, until now, had an open lane to reinvent herself as a moderate in what is still a Republican-leaning state.

As McSally’s first general election ad shows, the free ride is over.

Because of McSally’s surprisingly clear flight path to victory, we are changing the race rating from “Lean Democrat” to “Toss Up.” Let the desert duel begin.

Meanwhile in Montana, we have the battle of the flat tops.

Democratic Sen. Jon Tester was a marked man after he helped scuttle Trump’s nomination of his doctor, White House physician Ronny Jackson, to lead the troubled Veterans Administration. While the president vowed to knock Tester out in retribution, Republicans still needed a vehicle for their revenge.

In June, the state GOP chose state Auditor Matt Rosendale as their man. He’s been in politics in his adopted home state since 2010, using the fortune he made in real estate back East to, with varying degrees of success, push his way into state politics.

But despite a presidential campaign visit and two months to take the fight to Tester, Rosendale appears to still be lagging. They may have the same haircut, but so far Tester seems to have succeeded in setting himself apart.

For that reason, we move the race one notch to the left from, “Toss Up” to “Lean Democrat.”



THE RULEBOOK: ROOM TO GROW

“When the dimensions of a State attain to a certain magnitude, it requires the same energy of government and the same forms of administration which are requisite in one of much greater extent.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 13

TIME OUT: ‘IF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE IT, YOU GET TOUGHER’

Naval aviator John McCain was held as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam from Oct. 26, 1967 until March 14, 1973 – 1,966 days. He endured brutal beatings and abuse for much of that time because he declined to accept the pardon offered to him as the son of the admiral in command of the U.S. Pacific fleet. McCain refused to jump ahead of enlisted men and those who had been imprisoned before him. But his refusal denied the communists a public relations victory, and they spent their fury on the young pilot.

After returning home in 1973, McCain wrote a first-person account of his ordeal for U.S. News & World Report. We encourage you to read it all here. But in light of the announcement from McCain’s family that the 81-year-old senator from Arizona has discontinued medical treatment for the aggressive form of brain cancer with which he was stricken last year, we suggest some special consideration of the following passage:

“I was finding that prayer helped. It wasn’t a question of asking for superhuman strength or for God to strike the North Vietnamese dead. It was asking for moral and physical courage, for guidance and wisdom to do the right thing. I asked for comfort when I was in pain, and sometimes I received relief. I was sustained in many times of trial. When the pressure was on, you seemed to go one way or the other. Either it was easier for them to break you the next time, or it was harder. In other words, if you are going to make it, you get tougher as time goes by.”

So should every believer pray: courage, guidance and wisdom so that we too might get tougher as time goes by.

Amen.

ANOTHER KEY TRUMPWORLD FIGURE CUTS DEAL WITH FEDS

WSJ: “Allen Weisselberg, President Trump’s longtime financial gatekeeper, was granted immunity by federal prosecutors for providing information about Michael Cohen in the criminal investigation into hush-money payments for two women during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Weisselberg was called to testify before a federal grand jury in the investigation earlier this year, The Wall Street Journal previously reported, citing people familiar with the investigation. The decision by prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office to grant immunity to Mr. Weisselberg escalates the pressure on Mr. Trump, whom Mr. Weisselberg has served for decades as executive vice president and chief financial officer of the Trump Organization. After Mr. Trump was elected, he handed control of his financial assets and business interests to his two adult sons and Mr. Weisselberg.”



National Enquirer killed safe’s worth of damaging Trump stories - AP: “The National Enquirer kept a safe containing documents on hush-money payments and other damaging stories it killed as part of its cozy relationship with Donald Trump leading up to 2016 presidential election, people familiar with the arrangement told The Associated Press. The detail comes as several media outlets reported Thursday that federal prosecutors have granted immunity to National Enquirer chief David Pecker, potentially laying bare his efforts to protect his longtime friend Trump. … Several people familiar with the Enquirer’s parent, American Media Inc., who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they signed non-disclosure agreements, said the safe was a great source of power for Pecker, the company’s CEO.”



Continetti: ‘From Reality TV to Reality Politics’ - Free Beacon: “Trump went from star of reality TV to sole practitioner of reality politics. He turned Republican, national, then world politics into a riveting spectacle, a new sort of contest in which the stakes are nothing less than the fate of the United States and the protagonist must face down a staggering number of opponents to win the prize. And Trump had an advantage. He alone was familiar with the contents of the reality politics rulebook. Which meant that his antagonists, from Bob Corker to Robert Mueller, from Chuck Schumer to Elizabeth Warren, from the media to the NFL, from Ayatollah Khamenei to Xi Jinping, were on defense. … I had assumed that Trump`s unusual background would limit his influence over candidate behavior. As Cohen, Omarosa, and Avenatti show, one has to be removed from statehouses and governor`s mansions to practice reality politics. Recent events give me second thoughts. The emergence of these anti-Trumps suggests that there is a future for outsiders versed in tabloids, wrestling, and ‘structured reality.’”



FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS SPLIT ON CONFIRMING KAVANAUGH

Fox News: “Voters are increasingly divided over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court since President Trump announced him as his choice to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. Forty-five percent would confirm Kavanaugh, while 46 percent oppose him, according to the latest Fox News poll. Last month, voters supported him by a 38-32 percent margin. Many voters at that time, 30 percent, had no opinion on Kavanaugh’s nomination. That makes sense, given interviews for the July poll were conducted July 10-11, which was soon after the president’s July 9 prime-time announcement of his selection. Since July, support for Kavanaugh is up 15 points among Republicans (was 70, now 85 percent), while opposition among Democrats is up 20 points (was 58, now 78 percent). There’s a gender gap too, as men (53 percent) are 15 points more likely than women (38 percent) to support his confirmation. Many other nominees received similar mixed support. For example, voters backed the confirmation of President Trump’s first nominee Neil Gorsuch by a 45-39 percent margin (March 2017), and former President Obama’s second nominee Elena Kagan by 38-36 percent (June 2010).”



Kavanaugh takes a step back from presidential immunity - The Hill: “Senate Democrats on Thursday pressed Judge Brett Kavanaugh on how he would view potential obstruction of justice or other possible criminal charges against President Trump if he were confirmed to the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh appeared to walk back some of his earlier claims that the president should be shielded from investigations while in office, Democratic lawmakers who spoke with the Supreme Court nominee told The Hill. Trump has faced heightened legal scrutiny this week after his former longtime lawyer Michael Cohen told a judge that Trump directed him to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in hush money involving two women, in violation of campaign finance law. Senate Democrats say that Kavanaugh`s handling of any case against Trump that could potentially come before the Supreme Court will take center stage when the nominee`s confirmation hearings begin after Labor Day.”



Kavanaugh not involved in report on Ken Starr office leaks - WaPo: “An investigation into alleged leaks to the press from the office of independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr in the 1990s makes no reference to any role played by his one-time associate, Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh. The 1999 report, made public Thursday by the National Archives, cleared Starr’s office of allegations that it improperly leaked grand jury testimony. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee had urged its release in an effort to determine whether Kavanaugh was involved in such leaks. Kavanaugh played a lead role in Starr’s investigation into the death of Clinton White House deputy counsel Vincent Foster and President Bill Clinton’s relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky. He was a go-to source for journalists and authors.”



FLORIDA PRIMARY LEAVING SOME DEEP WOUNDS

Orlando Sentinel: “With Florida voters finally about to decide party nominees on Tuesday, both Republicans and Democrats could find themselves damaged by the fighting and attacks that have marked the race for governor. … On the GOP side, Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam and U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis haven’t let up on each other after weeks of bickering. Most polls suggest DeSantis, an outsider running largely on his endorsement by President Donald Trump, is leading over Putnam, a close ally of many state Republicans. … At the same time, attacks on former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham by fellow Democrats – especially Palm Beach billionaire Jeff Greene – could damage her going forward, especially if progressives backing Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum or Winter Park businessman Chris King find themselves on the losing side again when Bernie Sanders lost to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic race for president.”



It`s official: Balderson wins Ohio special election - Cincinnati Enquirer: “After all votes were counted, Republican Troy Balderson won a surprisingly tight race to replace former U.S. Rep. Pat Tiberi in a closely watched central Ohio district. Balderson, with endorsements from President Donald Trump and Gov. John Kasich, eked out a win over Democrat Danny O`Connor to fill the remaining months of Tiberi`s term. ‘I`m humbled by the support I`ve received from voters and look forward to representing Ohio`s 12th Congressional district in Congress,’ Balderson said in a statement Friday. He added that O`Connor ran a ‘hard-fought race.’ In an unusual turn of events, Balderson and O`Connor will face off again on Nov. 6, fighting this time for a two-year term in Congress. Balderson`s slim victory allows Republicans to maintain control of a seat that hasn`t been ceded to Democrats in decades. Tiberi and Kasich both served the district for years. The race never should have been that close.”



Dem Danny O`Connor flips stance on Pelosi speakership - Free Beacon: “Danny O`Connor, a Democratic congressional candidate in Ohio, said Friday he would not support House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) for speaker after previously saying that if she`s the one the ‘Democratic Party puts forward,’ he would. O`Connor appeared on MSNBC`s ‘Morning Joe’ to discuss his candidacy and answer questions about Pelosi, and he said Washington, D.C. needs ‘new leadership.’ MSNBC guest John Heilemann [said] … ‘My question for you is, what do you think of where the speaker currently is and whether you can envision a world in which Nancy Pelosi is not the speaker of — the potential speaker of the House and the head of your party?’ Heilemann asked. After dodging the question, MSNBC guest Susan Del Percio … repeated Heilemann`s question about whether he will support Pelosi for speaker if Democrats take control of the House. ‘No, I would not,’ O`Connor said. … O`Connor`s response contradicts what he said on MSNBC`s ‘Hardball With Chris Matthews’ on July 24.”



Pence, Scalise raise big bucks in New Orleans - The [Louisiana] Advocate: “Vice President Mike Pence and U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise rallied 140 Republican donors Thursday night in New Orleans by repeatedly warning about the specter of a Congress led by Nancy Pelosi, the former Democratic speaker of the House. … The fundraiser at the National World War II Museum took place at a time when many analysts believe that Democrats can win enough seats… Pence and Scalise told the well-heeled crowd that would be bad for America. … Pence and Scalise credited the tax cuts and other moves by the Trump administration with generating the country’s current strong economic growth, including what they said are record low unemployment rates among African-Americans and Hispanics.”



Trump sticks with establishment in Mississippi - WaPo: “President Trump declared his support Thursday for Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), wading into a closely watched race that has divided Republicans. In a pair of late-afternoon tweets, Trump wrote that Hyde-Smith has helped him ‘put America First!’ and has his ‘complete and total Endorsement.’ Hyde-Smith was appointed earlier this year to succeed Republican Thad Cochran, a longtime senator who stepped down amid health problems. She is running in a special election that will be held on Nov. 6, the same day as the regularly scheduled midterms. … Also in the Mississippi race is Chris McDaniel, an insurgent conservative who has been hostile to Senate GOP leaders and nearly defeated Cochran in 2014. McDaniel was encouraged to run by Stephen K. Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist.”

Biden makes rare endorsement in testy Delaware primary - NBC News: “Joe Biden is endorsing longtime colleague Tom Carper as he faces his toughest primary battle in decades, a rare move by the former vice president to take sides in a primary in his home state. Biden has agreed to record a robocall on behalf of Carper, who is seeking his fourth term as Delaware senator and has served in statewide office continuously since 1977. It will begin reaching state voters next week ahead of the Sept. 6 primary, NBC News has learned. … At first glance Biden`s endorsement of Carper is unsurprising, given the decades-long partnership between the two. But Biden has rarely — if ever — taken sides in Democratic primaries in his state since being elected to the Senate in 1972.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“You made the comment (based, I know on polls) that something better than 80 percent of GOP voters stand solidly behind the president. I am not sure what that ‘solidly’ actually means, but put me in the 20 percent. I feel for every Republican candidate running this year, for I know that at least a few of them must be appalled at, for instance, the remarks about Jeff Sessions, yet have to be afraid ever to hint of any disagreement with the president. Just glad I voted Libertarian so that I could stick to my principles. Cowardly? Maybe, but a bad choice means there was not a good choice. When Trump has done well it has been in areas where any Republican would have done the same.” – John Johnson, Tucson, Ariz.



[Ed. note: One of the most important questions in life, but particularly in politics is always “or what?” And to a certain degree partisan approval or disapproval ratings for sitting presidents are questions relating to voters’ satisfaction with their decisions in the previous election. Many in that 80 percent may not be saying that they are pleased with Trump, per se, but that they are glad that Hillary Clinton is not president. But that will go for 2020 as well, when Clinton is not on the ballot. There’s a great deal of attention paid to these job approval numbers. We do it, as do most of our peers, and they are useful. But in American politics what really matters are choices in binary votes. Of course, many, like yourself opted not to choose the lesser of two evils and excuse yourself from the bloody fray. So far, the Democrats have been the best thing Trump has had going for him. We’ll see if that continues to be the case after 2018 and into Trump’s re-election.]



“‘Who knows what might transpire if members of Congress voted by secret ballot?’ Going out on a limb, I hazard to guess a whole lot of mischief would transpire. We have enough trouble with voice votes. But seriously—as comedians and political pundits are wont to say—why shouldn`t all campaign donations be made anonymously so the politicians are not aware of their specific financiers? Making every constituent a possible, anonymous donor is a much better campaign finance reform than anything Russ Feingold and John McCain ever proposed.” – Michael Friend, Atlanta

[Ed. note: You are certainly right, Mr. Friend, but there are a few considerations to bear in mind. Are we to suppose that the individual’s collection of donations on behalf of campaigns would not find ways to signal to office holders the identities of their most generous friends? When a politician showed up at a party and saw people wearing say white boutonnieres or red armbands, he or she might know who gave what. Or, more simply, fundraisers could just tell candidates that Frank N. Stine or I. P. Freely were very, VERY enthusiastic supporters *wink* and did you know that Messrs. Stine and Freely happen to have applied for a fat government grant for their firm? Also to consider: Voters ought to know where campaigns’ support is coming from. It might be material to you to know that one faction, special interest or pressure group had fallen in with big cash for a particular candidate. There are no easy answers when it comes to campaign finance reform. Virginia’s system is pretty good. It doesn’t limit contributions but it does require instantaneous reporting, which is posted immediately online. As a rule, I tend to think that complexity is the enemy of accountability and understanding.]

PUTTING THE HEAD IN HEADSHOT

UPI: “A Missouri teen`s school photos are going viral after the green shirt he wore on picture day blended in with the photographer`s green screen. Laurel Hutsell said in a Facebook post that her son, Carter, wore a green shirt for his seventh grade picture day, and he came home concerned that the photographer was using green screen effects. Hutsell said she thought ‘maybe they will be OK,’ but when the sample proofs came back Carter appeared as a floating head due to the green screen backgrounds projecting onto his shirt. ‘At least his hair and smile were on point!’ Hutsell wrote. Inter State Studio, the studio behind the now-viral photos, said the proofs don`t go through a human proofing process to allow for a quick turnaround time. The studio said ‘floating head’ incidents like Carter`s occasionally happen, but the photos can be fixed for the final product.”

AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“Then there is John McCain, who is a party unto himself.”– Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post, May 27, 2005.

Chris Stirewalt is the politics editor for Fox News. Brianna McClelland contributed to this report. Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day? Sign up here.", Fox News Power Rankings: Candidates still count ,8-2018
"Candidates expressing strong support for President Trump continued their winning streak in Republican primaries Tuesday, capturing nominations in Florida, Arizona and Oklahoma. The victories confirm the strong approval ratings the president gets from Republicans across the nation.

In Florida, Republican voters nominated U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis to be their candidate for governor. DeSantis, a three-term congressman from the Jacksonville area, won a decisive victory over state Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam.

DeSantis was the underdog in the race until President Trump enthusiastically endorsed his candidacy and became a vigorous supporter. The president’s backing propelled DeSantis, who earned a Bronze Star in the Navy, to an impressive 57 percent to 37 percent victory over Putnam.

DeSantis has earned a reputation as an innovative conservative reformer in Congress and is well-positioned to take on Andrew Gillum, the far-left Tallahassee mayor and Democratic nominee who is backed by democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

Also in Florida, two-term Republican Gov. Rick Scott – another strong supporter of President Trump – easily won the GOP primary to become the party’s U.S. Senate candidate against Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. Scott currently leads Nelson by a margin of 46 percent to 44 percent, according to an average of recent polls.

Nelson, who has enormous name identification as the incumbent, is in a precarious position with such low support in the polls. Growing numbers of voters are seeing him for what he is – an out-of-touch career politician who has held elected office for most of the past 46 years.

Gov. Scott has pledged to help enact President Trump’s “America First” agenda if voters send him to the Senate. This represents a stark contrast to Nelson, who has essentially become little more than an obstructionist, following the lead of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

The run-off election in Oklahoma provided clarity for the fall elections in the Sooner State. Republicans chose political newcomer and businessman Kevin Stitt over former longtime Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett as their candidate for governor.

GOP voters also selected first-time conservative candidate and Trump supporter Matt Pinnell as their candidate for lieutenant governor over state Corporation Commission Chair Dana Murphy. Republicans have a considerable advantage in conservative Oklahoma, a state President Trump carried by a whopping 36 points in 2016.

In Arizona, two-term U.S. Rep. Martha McSally won a primary battle convincingly over former state Sen. Kelli Ward and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. McSally, a decorated retired Air Force colonel, will now square off against liberal Democratic U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema.

In the general election campaign, Sinema will have to explain to Arizona voters why she sided with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California in opposing President Trump’s historic tax cut. The tax cut has paved the way for robust economic growth, millions of new jobs and extraordinarily low unemployment rates – including the lowest Hispanic unemployment numbers ever recorded.

Also in Arizona, Gov. Doug Ducey secured a resounding primary victory after a welcome endorsement push from President Trump.

Senate Races Around the Country

Following Tuesday’s primaries, the stage is finally set in all the critical races around the country that will decide control of the U.S. Senate in the midterm elections.

In West Virginia, Trump-backed state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey will take on two-faced Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. Manchin talks up the Trump agenda on one end of Pennsylvania Avenue and then votes against it when he’s with his pal Chuck Schumer on Capitol Hill.

Morrisey will make the case that the Hillary Clinton-supporting Manchin clearly no longer represents the interests of West Virginia, a state whose citizens adore President Trump and rewarded him accordingly with an astonishing 42-point margin of victory in 2016.

Republican Trump-backed candidates are faring extremely well across the country in states the president won in 2016.

In North Dakota, a state President Trump carried by 36 points, polling indicates that Republican challenger U.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer is running ahead of incumbent Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp.

Similarly in Montana, where Trump cruised to a 21-point victory in 2016, Republican state Insurance Commissioner Matt Rosendale is leading liberal Democratic Sen. Jon Tester according to a recent poll.

Another hotly contested Senate race in the Midwest is in Missouri, where polls indicate conservative Republican state Attorney General Josh Hawley is running neck and neck with Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, another liberal career politician. President Trump is planning another trip to Missouri next month, a state he carried by 19 points in 2016.

And finally, in Indiana conservative outsider Mike Braun is running a very strong race to take the seat of Sen. Joe Donnelly, the incumbent Democrat. President Trump will be returning to Indiana this week – another state he carried by a commanding 19 points in 2016.

It’s clear that the Democrats in the Senate facing re-election in Trump Country are going to have plenty of sleepless nights between now and Election Day.

Will voters choose the Trump-powered Republican agenda of low taxes and less red tape, economic growth, border security and a strong military?

Or will voters choose the Schumer-Pelosi Democratic agenda of tax hikes, open borders and a meritless partisan impeachment witch hunt that will only be a waste of time and money?

The American people will study the issues and the candidates and make their decision. It’s a big one.", Trump-backed candidates keep on winning GOP primaries. Here`s what that means for November ,8-2018
"President Trump held a rally in Montana Thursday night as part of his effort to oust Sen. Jon Tester, one of his most bitter political opponents -- but the president took time to rail against several other big-name critics.

Speaking at the Four Seasons Arena in Great Falls, Trump said ""it`s time to retire"" Tester, a red-state Democrat. He added that Democrats ""actually got their ass kicked"" in 2016, drawing racuous applause as he proceeded to unload on such varied targets as The New York Times, Rep. Maxine Waters and Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

""Pocahontas, to you I apologize,"" Trump said. ""To the fake Pocahontas, I won`t apologize.""

He then joked that he would pull out a heritage kit during a hypothetical presidential debate with Warren and slowly toss it at her, ""hoping it doesn`t hit her and injure her arm, even though it only weighs probably two ounces."" Trump said he would offer to donate $1 million to Warren`s preferred charity if she took the ancestry test.

Warren has long been accused of falsely claiming she is of Native American heritage to help in securing jobs, including one as a Harvard law professor.

""Pocahontas, to you I apologize. To the fake Pocahontas, I won`t apologize."" - President Trump

Trump also took another dig at California Rep. Maxine Waters, whom he called ""the new leader"" of the Democratic party.

""Democrats want anarchy,"" Trump said, saying they would allow gangs like MS-13 ""run wild"" in America. ""And they don`t know who they`re playing with, folks.

""I said it the other day, yes, [Maxine Waters] is a low-IQ individual. Honestly, she`s somewhere in the mid-60s, I believe,"" Trump added.

WATCHDOG SAYS MAXINE WATERS INCITED `MOB VIOLENCE` AGAINST TRUMP OFFICIALS

Waters` vocal calls for public pushback against Trump officials has riled up her base of supporters, although the Democratic leadership has pushed back against calls to intimidate political opponents.

Tester -- the main target of the rally -- outraged the White House after he released disputed accusations that derailed the nomination of White House physician Ronny Jackson to be Veteran Affairs secretary earlier this year, leading Trump to demand Tester`s resignation.

""Jon Tester doesn`t share your values,"" Trump said at Thursday`s rally. ""He showed his true colors with his shameful, dishonest attacks on a great man -- a friend of mine.""

Trump highlighted Tester`s opposition to his travel ban and Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch.

He then commented on the woman escorted down from the Statue of Liberty yesterday following an anti-ICE protest.

""You saw that clown yesterday on the Statue of Liberty?"" Trump asked. ""You see the guys that went up there? I wouldn`t have done it. I would`ve said, `Let`s get some nets and wait until she comes down.`""

Trump also touted his progress with North Korea and vowed to get tough with NATO at this week`s summit in Brussels, saying members of the alliance aren`t paying enough towards their own security and are relying excessively on the U.S.

Trump was in Montana supporting State Auditor Matt Rosendale, who recently won the state`s Senate GOP primary and will face off against Tester in November. Polls show that Tester holds about a seven-point lead over Rosendale, even though Trump carried Montana by more than 20 points in 2016.

Before Trump spoke, Rosendale praised Trump for being a ""voice for the unborn"" and promised to support pro-life causes if elected -- particularly notable comments given expectations that Trump will soon nominate a conservative justice to the Supreme Court.

Tester`s seat is one of a handful that Republicans are hoping to flip as they hold onto a narrow majority in the Senate.

WATCH: JUST HOW VULNERABLE IS TESTER IN NOVEMBER?

Donald Trump Jr. kicked off the Tester tongue-lashing early on in the evening, before his father took the stage. He referred to him as ""two-faced Tester"" and derided his lack of support for the Republican tax overhaul and other key White House policies.

Towards the middle of the wild rally, the president called out critics who say he`s a poor communicator.

""They never say I am a great speaker,"" Trump said, as the crowd began to cheer loudly. ""Then why in the hell do so many people come?"""," Trump claims Maxine Waters` IQ in `mid-60s,` slams `fake Pocahontas` Elizabeth Warren in rally to unseat Jon Tester ",7-2018

""Democrats want anarchy,"" Trump said, saying they would allow gangs like MS-13 ""run wild"" in America. ""And they don`t know who they`re playing with, folks.

""I said it the other day, yes, [Maxine Waters] is a low-IQ individual. Honestly, she`s somewhere in the mid-60s, I believe,"" Trump added.

WATCHDOG SAYS MAXINE WATERS INCITED `MOB VIOLENCE` AGAINST TRUMP OFFICIALS

Waters` vocal calls for public pushback against Trump officials has riled up her base of supporters, although the Democratic leadership has pushed back against calls to intimidate political opponents.

Tester -- the main target of the rally -- outraged the White House after he released disputed accusations that derailed the nomination of White House physician Ronny Jackson to be Veteran Affairs secretary earlier this year, leading Trump to demand Tester`s resignation.

""Jon Tester doesn`t share your values,"" Trump said at Thursday`s rally. ""He showed his true colors with his shameful, dishonest attacks on a great man -- a friend of mine.""

Trump highlighted Tester`s opposition to his travel ban and Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch.

He then commented on the woman escorted down from the Statue of Liberty yesterday following an anti-ICE protest.

""You saw that clown yesterday on the Statue of Liberty?"" Trump asked. ""You see the guys that went up there? I wouldn`t have done it. I would`ve said, `Let`s get some nets and wait until she comes down.`""

Trump also touted his progress with North Korea and vowed to get tough with NATO at this week`s summit in Brussels, saying members of the alliance aren`t paying enough towards their own security and are relying excessively on the U.S.

Trump was in Montana supporting State Auditor Matt Rosendale, who recently won the state`s Senate GOP primary and will face off against Tester in November. Polls show that Tester holds about a seven-point lead over Rosendale, even though Trump carried Montana by more than 20 points in 2016.

Before Trump spoke, Rosendale praised Trump for being a ""voice for the unborn"" and promised to support pro-life causes if elected -- particularly notable comments given expectations that Trump will soon nominate a conservative justice to the Supreme Court.

Tester`s seat is one of a handful that Republicans are hoping to flip as they hold onto a narrow majority in the Senate.

WATCH: JUST HOW VULNERABLE IS TESTER IN NOVEMBER?

Donald Trump Jr. kicked off the Tester tongue-lashing early on in the evening, before his father took the stage. He referred to him as ""two-faced Tester"" and derided his lack of support for the Republican tax overhaul and other key White House policies.

Towards the middle of the wild rally, the president called out critics who say he`s a poor communicator.

""They never say I am a great speaker,"" Trump said, as the crowd began to cheer loudly. ""Then why in the hell do so many people come?"""," Trump claims Maxine Waters` IQ in `mid-60s,` slams `fake Pocahontas` Elizabeth Warren in rally to unseat Jon Tester ",7-2018
"On Monday evening, President Trump nominated D.C. Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, leaving red state Democratic Senators with the dilemma of a lifetime as they approach Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing: betray Chuck Schumer or betray the voters that put them there.

Any legal expert will tell you that Kavanaugh is deserving of resounding confirmation. In fact, Liberal Yale Law Professor Akhil Amar, who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, called President Trump’s entire 25-person Supreme Court nominee list “distinguished” and “impressive.” Monday night, in a piece entitled “A Liberal’s Case for Brett Kavanaugh,” Amar wrote: “I strongly supported Hillary Clinton… [but] it is hard to name anyone with judicial credential as strong as those of Judge Kavanaugh.” thus giving red state Democrats no valid reason to oppose him.

The Supreme Court has given its stamp of approval to more than a dozen of Kavanaugh’s decisions, and more than 210 judges nationwide have cited his most popular opinions. Perhaps most qualifying of all, though, is this singular sentence written by Kavanaugh: “[R]ead the words of the statute as written. Read the text of the Constitution as written… Don’t make up new constitutional rights that are not in the text of the Constitution.”

This incontrovertible statement is precisely the role of a judge and precisely the reason not a single Democrat should oppose the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh, a Constitution-abiding judge with a proven track record.

As November approaches, it should come as no surprise that these vulnerable red state Democrats are now engaging in some fancy political footwork as they desperately try to convince their constituents that they are Trump allies, despite their proven track record of opposing him.

If not out of principle, red state Democrats ought to vote for Kavanaugh based on political fate.

Ten Democratic senators up for reelection this November hail from states that President Trump won, and in many of them commandingly so.

President Trump won Claire McCaskill’s state of Missouri by 19 points; Joe Donnelly’s Indiana by 19 points; Jon Tester’s Montana by 21 points; Heidi Heitkamp’s North Dakota by 36 points; and Joe Manchin’s West Virginia by an eye-opening 42 points.

In each of these states, voters sent an unmistakable message to their elected officials: We support President Trump and his agenda. And yet, in each of these states, their senators talk like Donald Trump – but vote like Chuck Schumer.

As November approaches, it should come as no surprise that these vulnerable red state Democrats are now engaging in some fancy political footwork as they desperately try to convince their constituents that they are Trump allies, despite their proven track record of opposing him.

With a vacancy on the Supreme Court and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell planning a Senate confirmation vote this fall, these faux Trump-supporting Democratic senators now have the opportunity to put their money where their mouth is and vote for President Trump’s highly qualified nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.

Opposing Kavanaugh is fraught with political risks. Voting against Kavanaugh will undoubtedly open Democrats up to attacks from Republican opponents – attacks like those we’ve already seen in Missouri, where Republican opponent Josh Hawley calls out Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill in a new ad over the upcoming Supreme Court vote.

As a confirmation vote on Kavanaugh approaches, every red state Democrat will be forced to answer the following question: are you Trump allies in word or in action?

Senator Jon Tester recently took out a full page ad in 14 Montana newspapers thanking President Trump and touting “Jon’s 16 bills signed into law by President Trump” (this despite his vote against tax cuts and against Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch).

Will Jon Tester’s words be followed by action?

Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia renounced his support for Hillary Clinton and said he would be “open” to voting for Trump in 2020.

Will Joe Manchin’s words be followed by action?

Senator Joe Donnelly brags that he voted with Trump more than every other Democratic senator with just two exceptions (keep in mind they all voted against tax cuts and permitted the government to shut down).

Will Joe Donnelly’s words be followed by action?

Time will tell.

If these vulnerable Democrats do vote for Kavanaugh, they are sure to provoke the ire of the Democratic leadership. Asked about red state Democrats losing elections because of their votes against the nominee, Minority Whip Dick Durbin flatly stated: “They understand it’s an historic decision. It’s about more than the next election.”

In essence, Durbin is perversely suggesting that these red state Democrats put party before people – the very people that made them United States Senators.

Ten Senate Democrats – Claire McCaskill, Heidi Heitkamp, Bill Nelson, Sherrod Brown, Bob Casey, Tammy Baldwin, Debbie Stabenow, Jon Tester, Joe Manchin, and Joe Donnelly – will have to make the choice to stand with Chuck Schumer or to stand with the people of their great states.

People over party should be the easy answer.", Kavanaugh`s nomination leaves red state Democrats with dilemma of a lifetime – betray their party or voters? ,7-2018
"Tuesday kicks off primary elections in multiple states across the country, including Alabama, California, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota.

From close primary races to districts Democrats hope to turn blue in the midterms, read on for a look at five races to watch on Tuesday -- that aren’t in California.

New Mexico governor

Democrats are hoping to turn New Mexico blue with the gubernatorial race this year with an electorate that has been tilting progressive. Susana Martinez, the current Republican governor, cannot seek re-election due to term limits.

For the Democrats, Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, state Sen. Joseph Cervantes and entrepreneur Jeff Apodaca are contending for their party’s nomination. Both Lujan Grisham and Apodaca come from political families in the Land of Enchantment state.

Lujan Grisham, seen as the frontrunner among Democrats, has already secured endorsements from Planned Parenthood, EMILY’s List and a bevy of local labor unions, according to her campaign website. She’s also been endorsed by state Attorney General Hector Balderas.

Lonna Atkeson, a University of New Mexico political science professor, told the Albuquerque Journal that Grisham could have an “edge,” as she`s the only woman in the race.

For Republicans, Rep. Steve Pearce is running unopposed. Pearce is known in Congress as a reserved, “low word-count guy.” He’s voted about 85 percent of time in agreement with President Trump -- although he’s publicly opposed the border wall.

Pearce’s campaign has placed an emphasis on job creation as New Mexico has the second-highest unemployment rate in the nation.

Democrats already control much of New Mexico politics, including the legislature and other statewide offices. A win for Democrats in this race could shut out Republicans from redistricting decisions made in 2021.

Clinton took New Mexico with 48 percent of the vote, compared to Trump`s 40 percent.

Montana Senate

Although incumbent Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat, has emphasized his record of voting for more than a dozen bills signed into law by Trump, November’s general election is considered a toss-up by Fox News.

Four Republicans are vying for the Republican nomination to take on Tester in the fall: combat veteran Troy Downing, Judge Russ Fagg, state Sen. Albert Olszewski and state auditor Matt Rosendale.

All four GOP candidates, even Fagg, who is considered to be a favorite among the more establishment-type Republicans, have aligned themselves with the president.

“It’s all been a competition to see who can be the most aligned with Trump. It’s a reflection of where these candidates think the Republican Party is in Montana,” Dr. Robert Saldin, a University of Montana political science professor, told Fox News.

Trump won Montana with about 56 percent of the vote in 2016. In comparison, 2008 Republican nominee John McCain garnered about 50 percent.

Although none of the four Republican candidates have star name recognition, Saldin said a Tester loss shouldn’t be ruled out.

“Anytime you’re running as a Republican in Montana statewide, you’ve got a shot,” he said.

With endorsements from Sens. Mike Lee, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, Rosendale has emerged as a frontrunner in the primary, Dr. David C.W. Parker, a Montana State University political science professor told Fox News.

South Dakota governor

Rep. Kristi Noem and state Attorney Gen. Marty Jackley are facing off in the Republican gubernatorial primary in South Dakota.

Although it started off cordial, the Republican primary has turned a bit volatile, The Argus Leader reported -- especially in campaign ads and a recent debate. Jackley has painted Noem as a Washington insider, while Noem has touted her relationship with Trump.

The primary is a close one: a recent poll from The Argus Leader and KELO-TV has Noem ahead by only one percentage point.

Whoever wins the GOP primary will likely face state Sen. Billie Sutton, a Democrat who is running unopposed. The seat is currently held by Republican Gov. Dennis Daugaard, who is term-limited.

In the presidential election, Trump won 62 percent of the vote, compared to Hillary Clinton, who won 32 percent.

Iowa congressional race

One of several competitive races where Democrats are hoping to flip a seat is the 1st congressional district in Iowa.

Rep. Rod Blum, a Republican, faces a tough re-election campaign in what Fox News’ has labeled a toss-up election. He’s running unopposed in the primary, but a group of energized Democrats are vying to take him on in the general election. His seat is one targeted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

For Democrats, state Rep. Abby Finkenauer, Thomas Heckroth, Army veteran George Ramsey and aerospace engineer Courtney Rowe will face off in Tuesday’s primary election.

Seen as the frontrunner among Democrats, Finkenauer has already gotten the endorsements of EMILY’s List, NARAL and several state lawmakers. She has also raised the most money with nearly $1.3 million, the Des Moines Register reported. Finkenauer, 28, would be the youngest woman elected to Congress if she wins. (Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., became the youngest woman to be elected in 2014 at the age of 30.)

The Democratic Party is ready and welcoming a challenging race in November, especially after Trump’s election. Linn County Democratic Party Chairman Bret Nilles previously told Fox News that he’s seen “more enthusiasm since the election results than we had prior to” the presidential election.

Nilles also said he hopes Blum’s support for Trump will help Democrats in November. Trump won about 51 percent of the vote in Iowa in the 2016 election -- compared to Clinton’s 42 percent -- but according to the Des Moines Register, “no party” voters make up a huge difference in the 1st congressional district. About 32 percent of voters in the district are registered Democrats, 29 percent are Republicans and the rest aren’t affiliated with a party, the newspaper reported.

""No Party"" voters hold the secret to understanding why incumbents do well in the district and why a conservative Republican continues to win a district in which Democrats outnumber Republicans,” Christopher Larimer, a University of Northern Iowa political scientist, wrote in a book about the district, according to the Des Moines Register.

Blum, 63, was first elected to the seat in 2014.

New Jersey Senate

This Senate seat is almost sure to remain safely in the hands of Democrats -- but expect Sen. Bob Menendez’s corruption and bribery case to play a big role.

Fox News’ ranks the New Jersey Senate race as “likely Democrat.”

Brian Goldberg, a business owner, and Bob Hugin, a former pharmaceutical executive, are facing off in the Republican primary Tuesday in an effort to take on Menendez. Hugin, who is expected to win the primary, has distanced himself from Trump. Goldberg, who unsuccessfully ran for Senate in 2014, has embraced Trump, on the other hand -- even holding a “Supporters of President Trump Rally” in April.

Clinton took New Jersey with 55 percent of the vote; Trump won 41 percent.

Whoever Menendez faces in the general, it’s sure to be a “nasty” election cycle, Peter Woolley, a Fairleigh Dickinson University politics professor, told The Morning Call newspaper.

“When the candidates go negative before the primary is even held, you can look forward to more of the same in the general election,"" he said.

Menendez faces a primary challenger in publisher Lisa McCormick who has said she’s running just to give New Jersey Democrats another option. He is expected to beat her in the primary.

Menendez was accused of accepting a plethora of donations and gifts from a wealthy friend in exchange for political influence. His case ended in a mistrial last year after a jury failed to deliver a verdict. He was formally admonished by the Senate Ethics Committee earlier this year.

On the roster: There’s more to primary day than California - California Dems risk House seat with hateful race - Scouting Report: Bernie’s backing of dubious worth - Trump asserts ‘absolute right’ to pardon himself - **Rubs temples**

THERE’S MORE TO PRIMARY DAY THAN CALIFORNIA

Being the biggest has its privileges. And being the most populous state means that California’s politics get outsized significance.

It’s the political equivalent of the phenomenon that when a blizzard hits New York City and whether you’re sunning your buns in Scottsdale, Ariz. or dining al fresco in Florence, S.C., you are subjected to nonstop coverage of the “snowpocalyspe” or “snowapalooza.”

Media markets and metropolitan size matter a great deal in terms of coverage, but it’s too easy to overlook the stories that affect the 264 million people who live in neither the New York metro area nor California.

So we know you know that California has a very consequential primary coming up Tuesday. And we promise to be back with blowout coverage of the Golden State’s races. They matter so much for what they will say about the direction Democrats are likely to take this fall and in 2020, so we will not skimp.

However…

Today, let’s get up to speed on the other states voting Tuesday: Mississippi, Alabama, Iowa, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota. Put together, that list includes four Senate races, four gubernatorial races and primary contests in nine of the most competitive House districts in the country.

Golden State may be dominating Cleveland so far, but the heartland won’t be getting shut out on Tuesday.



MOUTHY SOUTHIE: S.D. GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY TURNS UGLY

[S.D.] Argus Leader: “The gloves are off in the final days of South Dakota`s GOP primary contest. … It wasn`t always a contentious campaign, but over the last several weeks, Attorney General Marty Jackley and U.S. Rep. Kristi Noem are tirelessly working to convince voters that they`re the best choice to lead South Dakota for the next four years. … Both candidates started airing negative ads about their opponent and releasing daily releases about his or her shortcomings. And in separate interviews with the Argus Leader, Noem and Jackley laid out plans to highlight the nuances that they thought could set them apart in the eyes of voters. The candidates appeared nearly even in an Argus Leader-KELO TV poll published Tuesday, with Noem picking up 45 percent of support from Republican voters likely to cast ballots in the primary while Jackley picked up 44 percent.”

NEW MEXICO FACES TURNING POINT ELECTION

Albuquerque Journal: “A critical election year in New Mexico – one that could establish the political pecking order for years – will begin taking shape Tuesday as voters choose the Democratic and Republican nominees for two open congressional seats, governor and other state offices. … Two members of Congress – Democrat Michelle Lujan Grisham and Republican Steve Pearce – are leaving safe seats to try for the Governor’s Office, where the Republican incumbent, Susana Martinez, cannot run because of term limits. And voters have a broad mix of political veterans and newcomers to choose from as they weigh the nominees to succeed Lujan Grisham and Pearce in the U.S. House. … In the governor’s race, meanwhile, Lujan Grisham faces intense competition just to win the nomination. Pearce is unopposed on the Republican side. Democratic gubernatorial candidates Jeff Apodaca, a former media executive, and state Sen. Joseph Cervantes, a lawyer, are campaigning aggressively in the final days…”

Rivals pounce on Dem frontrunner’s financial disclosure - Politico: “Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham earned more from her role as co-owner of the company that runs New Mexico’s high-risk insurance program than she stated on her congressional financial disclosure forms for 2013, according to a review of the report and newly released tax returns. In annual financial disclosures required for members of Congress, Lujan Grisham initially reported receiving between $50,001 and $100,000 in dividends in 2013 from the Delta Consulting Group, which she co-founded in 2008 with a political ally who went on to get elected to the New Mexico Legislature. But her tax returns show she earned nearly $138,000 in so-called ‘passive income’ from the company that year.”

IOWA GUBERNATORIAL RACE GETS CRAZY EXPENSIVE

Des Moines Register: “Iowans will head to the polls in Tuesday`s primary in what will likely become the most expensive gubernatorial race in the state’s history. Candidates for governor raised roughly $17 million since the start of 2017 — an amount that outpaces what’s been amassed during entire election cycles in recent years. Of that, $12.4 million has already been spent blanketing the airwaves with television ads, hiring consultants and sending mailers. Those massive numbers include through the middle of May and will only grow in the final pre-primary tally. The high spending comes amid higher stakes. Iowa Democrats — facing a volatile primary season, a slew of recent election losses and two years of total Republican control in the Statehouse — say they can’t afford another four years under Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds. Reynolds supporters say the state should stay the course in November and re-elect the first female governor it has ever had.”

CLUB FOR GROWTH MAKES A BIG BET IN MONTANA

Politico: “Club for Growth President David McIntosh thinks Republicans are being far too bearish in their predictions for the Senate this cycle, and he says it will be a complete failure of party leadership if they lose the upper chamber. McIntosh hopes his conservative organization can help sway critical races for its favored candidates, from hard-fought Republican primaries to campaigns against Democratic incumbents in deep-red states. The group`s most notable investment so far has been in Tuesday’s Montana Senate primary, where it has spent $1.7 million backing state Auditor Matt Rosendale, widely viewed as the Republican front-runner, and attacking his chief opponent, former Judge Russ Fagg. The Club started spending in early May, and those investments helped set the tone for the final weeks of the race to take on Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. Montana is just the earliest preview of the Club’s spending plans for this cycle.”

NEW JERSY DEMS EYE LONG-SOUGHT PRIZE

The Trentonian: “A competitive primary between two Democratic rivals on Tuesday will fire up the base as the party seeks to unseat Republican incumbent U.S. Rep. Chris Smith in November. Smith has represented New Jersey’s Fourth Congressional District since 1981, but his prospective challengers say he has lost touch with the constituents of Monmouth, Ocean and Mercer counties. Fellow Democratic candidatesJosh Welle and Jim Keady, however, have to first emerge victorious in Tuesday’s primary in order to challenge Smith in the general election. Only one Democrat can get the party’s nomination to compete in the main event, so Welle and Keady are therefore battling it out to determine which one will appear on the fall ballot.”

IVEY GROWS STRONGER IN ALABAMA

AL.com: “Liz Davis may typify the average Alabama voter ahead of Tuesday`s election: She`s aware of the primary, isn`t sure who all is running and is ‘too busy’ to keep up with the blitz of campaign advertisements promoting statewide and local races. But she has heard the name ‘Kay Ivey,’ and she thinks the current governor is doing a good enough job. ‘I like what that lady has been doing,’ said Davis, 57, of Mobile, during a recent lunch at Hickory Pit Too in Semmes. … Davis` sentiments are shared among almost all Alabama political observers contacted by AL.com in recent days. To the expert, anything less than an outright Ivey win during Tuesday`s Republican primary would be a shocker. Ivey is opposed by three candidates: Birmingham evangelist Scott Dawson, Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle and Alabama State Senator Bill Hightower of Mobile. A runoff, if needed, is July 17.”

MISSISSIPPI NICE?

Fox News: “Mississippi has no shortage of candidates seeking to win its two U.S. Senate elections and a broadly contested 3rd District House race this year, but with only a handful of exceptions, there has been a noticeable lack of fireworks. The relative tranquility in the races has surprised local observers, who say it`s the happy product of strong incumbents, narrowly avoided primary challenges, and policy agreements on key issues. There have been some splashes of unexpected drama. Last month, actors Robert De Niro and Alec Baldwin helped host a pricey cocktail party in Manhattan for a Democrat campaigning in what is widely viewed as a futile effort to unseat Republican incumbent Roger Wicker in the Senate. The party, which had suggested campaign donations ranging from $1,000 to $5,400 per person, benefitted Howard Sherman, one of six Democrats facing off in the June 5 primary, his campaign confirmed to The Associated Press.”

THE RULEBOOK: WHAT HE SAID

“Let us not attempt to reconcile contradictions, but firmly embrace a rational alternative.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 23

TIME OUT: WILTING FLOWERS

Smithsonian: “A new X-ray study confirms … [Vincent Van Gogh’s] paints are fading over time. … In the latest study, reports [The Guardian’s Daniel Boffrey], scientists created a detailed X-ray ‘chemical map’ of one of the sunflower paintings held in Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum, mapping the areas where Van Gogh used the UV-sensitive pigments and areas where he used less sensitive paint. …Van Gogh used the photo-sensitive pigments in about half the painting. Currently, the darkening of the paint and the wilting of the sunflowers is not visible to the naked eye. But researchers are not sure how long they will stay vibrant. The museum has already taken some steps to protect the artwork, like installing smart LEDs last year which allow them to control the light spectrum hitting the paintings and more finely control the brightness and hours of light paintings receive. Despite the effort, there is currently no known way to keep the chrome paints from changing color. And it’s not just the sunflowers at risk—Van Gogh used the light-sensitive paint in many of his other works.”

CALIFORNIA DEMS RISK HOUSE SEAT WITH HATEFUL RACE

Politico: “Gil Cisneros and Andy Thorburn, two millionaire Democratic candidates for a battleground House district in Southern California, had been attacking each other so ruthlessly that party leaders encouraged them to meet at an Italian restaurant in Los Angeles last month to force a truce: Play nice, or risk forfeiting a top district to Republicans. The armistice, brokered by California Democratic Party Chairman Eric Bauman and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, altered the course of one of the stranger primaries of 2018, replete with party meddling and nasty attacks but few policy differences. Looming above it all is the possibility that two Republicans will advance to the general election to replace Republican Rep. Ed Royce in a district Hillary Clinton carried in 2016. The Orange County-based seat tops the nationwide list of Democratic targets, but it became the site of an early, multimillion-dollar rescue operation when it became clear the wide field of Democrats could split their vote enough to land a pair of Republicans atop the all-party primary on Tuesday.”

Riggleman chosen to replace Rep. Tom Garrett - WaPo: “Republican activists chose Denver Riggleman at a meeting Saturday in central Virginia to replace Rep. Thomas Garrett (R) on the November ballot, following a frenzied five-day campaign. The craft distillery owner and former Air Force intelligence officer will face Democrat Leslie Cockburn, a journalist, author and first-time candidate trying to capitalize on opposition to President Trump in Charlottesville and other liberal enclaves in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District. The district is among about 100 nationwide that Democrats are targeting in hopes of taking control of the House in the midterm elections. It is a reliably red seat, but the pressure was on activists to choose a candidate who can unite hard-line conservative, libertarian and moderate Republicans and overcome a blue wave if it materializes. … The nominee was decided after five hours and four rounds of secret balloting that came down to two candidates: Riggleman and Cynthia Dunbar, a national GOP committeewoman with far-right views.”



GOP doubles number of female candidates - The Hill: “House Republicans have doubled the number of female candidates they have recruited to run for congressional seats this year as they seek to hold their majority and counter accusations of a gender gap with Democrats. There are 103 Republican women, including incumbents, running for House seats this election — up from 48 in the previous election cycle, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. The recruitments could be crucial in a year where the majority is likely to be decided in suburban swing districts where college-educated women and independent voters form a crucial voting bloc. Democrats have been busy attracting candidates in those districts, too, as the #MeToo movement and furor surrounding President Trump’s policies energizes the left.”

The Erins tag team Minnesota gubernatorial race - Minneapolis Star Tribune: “Minnesota DFLers wrapped up their hard-fought endorsing convention Sunday by unexpectedly backing lieutenant governor candidate Erin Maye Quade, a rookie legislator whose fight against sexual harassment and sit-in for gun control vaulted her into the spotlight. Minnesota DFLers backed Maye Quade a day after state Rep. Erin Murphy won the gubernatorial endorsement over U.S. Rep. Tim Walz in seven rounds of voting. … This weekend’s Republican and DFL endorsement conventions have set the stage for showdowns this fall. In order for Murphy and Maye Quade to face off with GOP contenders in the November general election, they would first have to beat at least one fellow DFL ticket in the August primary. Walz, of Mankato, and his running mate state Rep. Peggy Flanagan, of St. Louis Park, plan to head to the primary even though they lost the party’s endorsement.”

SCOUTING REPORT: BERNIE’S BACKING OF DUBIOUS WORTH

WSJ: “There is no candidate in the country for whom Sen. Bernie Sanders has expended more political capital this year than Pete D’Alessandro. Mr. Sanders hosted a rally for Mr. D’Alessandro, a U.S. House candidate who ran the Vermont senator’s 2016 presidential campaign in Iowa. He twice emailed his supporters soliciting campaign funds for Mr. D’Alessandro and recorded his only TV ad of the year to urge support for him. Yet Mr. D’Alessandro, a longtime Iowa Democratic political operative, appears from public polling set to place third in Tuesday’s Democratic primary. The Sanders seal of approval, for Mr. D’Alessandro and a handful of other Democrats, isn’t turning out to be a winning one in this year’s congressional elections.”

Biden to decide on run after midterms - NBC News: “The former vice president [Joe Biden] already has been one of the most active Democratic surrogates in 2017 and 2018, and his advisers are hard at work on plans for a busy campaign schedule this fall that could have him appearing at as many as a dozen events each week. At the same time, he and a trusted inner circle have quietly been engaging a wider network of political allies to sketch the outlines of what a Biden 2020 candidacy might look like should he decide to run, multiple sources who have participated in the discussions tell NBC News. Biden himself has only gone so far as to say he’s not ruled out what would be a third run for the White House. He’s also been adamant that while a decision won’t come until after the 2018 midterms, it shouldn’t linger much beyond year’s end — a timetable that would help to bring some order to what could be the largest Democratic presidential field in generations.”

Starbucks boss steps down, hints at possible 2020 run - Fox Business: “Howard Schultz, the Starbucks executive who oversaw the Seattle coffeehouse chain’s global expansion, will step down as the company’s executive chairman of the board, the company confirmed on Monday. Schultz, 64, spent four decades working at Starbucks. … A prominent critic of President Donald Trump, Schultz has long been rumored to have political aspirations. Schultz said earlier this year that the Trump administration ‘is creating episodic chaos’ in the country. ‘I want to be truthful with you without creating more speculative headlines,’ Schultz told The New York Times on Monday. ‘For some time now, I have been deeply concerned about our country — the growing division at home and our standing in the world.’ ‘One of the things I want to do in my next chapter is to figure out if there is a role I can play in giving back,’ he added. ‘I’m not exactly sure what that means yet.’”



TRUMP ASSERTS ‘ABSOLUTE RIGHT’ TO PARDON HIMSELF

Fox News: “President Trump sought to settle the widespread weekend chatter over whether he’d consider pardoning himself if charged in the Russia probe – tweeting Monday that he has the ‘absolute right’ to do so, but wouldn’t have to since he’s ‘done nothing wrong.’ ‘As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong? In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats (& others) continues into the mid-terms!’ the president tweeted. Moments later, the president decried the investigation as ‘UNCONSTITUTIONAL’ -- the latest swipe at Special Counsel Robert Mueller amid negotiations over a possible interview with the president. … Trump weighed in after legal team member Rudy Giuliani fielded numerous questions on the self-pardon scenario on the Sunday shows. ‘The president of the United States pardoning himself would just be unthinkable. And it would lead to probably an immediate impeachment,’ he said bluntly on NBC’s ‘Meet the Press.’”



Giuliani says Mueller needs to ‘man up’ - Fox News: “Special Counsel Robert Mueller is sensitive to pulling ‘another Comey’ as the Russia probe enters its final months, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani said in an interview Sunday. Calling the investigation a ‘long nightmare with the American people,’ Giuliani also issued a challenge directly to Mueller`s team, telling investigators to ‘man up’ rather than seek to subpoena President Trump. ‘They have to make a decision without it,’ Giuliani said on ABC`s ‘This Week,’ noting that the Trump team has already made available several witnesses and turned over more than a million documents. ‘So, come on, man up and make your decision.’ Meanwhile, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told ‘Fox News Sunday’ that President Trump’s legal team will ‘take it to court’ if Mueller subpoenas him as part of the Russia probe.”

GOP LOOKS BEYOND MCCARTHY FOR SPEAKER CHOICES

WSJ: “House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Majority Whip Steve Scalise are the lawmakers to beat to replace the departing House Speaker Paul Ryan. But their status as the frontrunners to succeed Mr. Ryan, who plans to leave office in January, hasn’t quelled chatter on Capitol Hill of who else might become a contender. And a brewing fight over immigration could foment angst within the House GOP, leading to unpredictable outcomes. … Still, it’s not clear that conservatives would want to push Mr. Ryan out early—and none of the candidates to succeed him has enough support to force him to leave. Many House Republicans are consumed by their own re-election races, with relatively few weeks of legislating in Washington scheduled before the midterms. … Most of those being discussed as potential GOP leadership candidates already flex some power, including Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina… Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden of Oregon; Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul of Texas; and Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma…”



McCarthy still defending tariffs - Politico: “House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Sunday defended the administration for leveraging tariffs on close allies as ‘standing up’ for free trade. ‘We are in the middle of a trade discussion. Nobody wants to be in a trade war. Nobody wins a trade war,’ the California Republican said on CNN’s ‘State of the Union.’ ‘But we are standing up for the process of where we`re moving forward that we have fair trade. President Donald Trump last week announced tariffs on metal imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union, prompting each to announce they are considering retaliatory tariffs. Other Republicans have attacked the tariffs, including Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.)… McCarthy pointed to specifics in the trade imbalance, even with one of America’s closest allies.”

SUPCO SIDES WITH BAKER WHO SHUNNED GAY WEDDING

Fox News: “The Supreme Court ruled Monday in favor of a Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, in one of the most closely watched cases of the term. In a 7-2 decision, the justices set aside a Colorado court ruling against the baker -- while stopping short of deciding the broader issue of whether a business can refuse to serve gay and lesbian people. The opinion was penned by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is often the swing justice in tight cases. The narrow ruling here focused on what the court described as anti-religious bias on the Colorado Civil Rights Commission when it ruled against baker Jack Phillips. ‘The Commission’s hostility was inconsistent with the First Amendment’s guarantee that our laws be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion,’ Kennedy wrote in his majority opinion.”

David French: How Kennedy did it - National Review: “No, the Court did not issue the sweeping free-speech ruling that many advocates hoped for and others feared. Instead it issued a ruling that reminded state authorities that people of faith have the exact same rights — and are entitled to the exact same treatment — as people of different faith or no faith at all. … The Lord works in mysterious ways, and it is no small irony that the same justice who just struck a blow for the dignity of the faithful is also the man most responsible for creating the constitutional right to same-sex marriage. State bullies beware, when Justice Kennedy declared in Obergefell that the First Amendment still protects religious people as they seek to teach and uphold those “principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths,” he meant what he said. Tolerance, it appears, is not a one-way street.”

BILL CLINTON IN BREAKDOWN LANE

NYT: “Former President Bill Clinton celebrated the #MeToo movement in an interview that aired on Monday, but said that it would have done little to change his response to the scandal that prompted his impeachment. ‘I don’t think it would be an issue because people would be using the facts instead of the imagined facts,’ he said in the interview on NBC’s ‘Today’ show. When asked whether he would handle the response to his affair with Monica Lewinsky, then a White House intern, any differently, Mr. Clinton said, ‘If the facts were the same today, I wouldn’t.’ … In the run-up to this year’s midterm elections, Mr. Clinton has been virtually invisible on the campaign trail because of new scrutiny of his past treatment of women, including Ms. Lewinsky. For years, he had deflected allegations of sexual harassment and assault from several women, but several of his accusers have felt empowered recently as the #MeToo movement gained momentum. Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones, three of the women who have accused Mr. Clinton of sexual harassment, said in November that they felt newly vindicated.”

Yglesias: Democrats struggle with re-evaluation of Clinton misdeeds - Vox: “Of course, Democrats aren’t going to travel back in time to force Bill Clinton to resign in the late 1990s. But it also now seems clear that Clinton won’t be able to avoid answering these questions in future public appearances, which may well make him less likely to want to make public appearances in the future. There is also a strong likelihood that Clinton, who has been a mainstay of Democratic National Conventions for decades, won’t be speaking in 2020 or deployed as a campaign surrogate this fall for the first time in a generation. Yet it’s also clear that another cohort of Democrats — especially those on the older, maler side — are uncomfortable with the direction Gillibrand is going. That’s in part a disagreement about political tactics, with some seeing it as foolish for Democrats to try to hold themselves to a high standard of conduct when Republicans hold Trump to no standard at all. But it’s probably better to think of it as primarily a disagreement about substance and the still-ambiguous legacy of #MeToo.”

HOUSE GOP FACE PRESSURE TO MAKE IMMIGRATION DECISION

The Hill: “House Republicans are facing a make-or-break moment on immigration as they return to Washington this week. GOP members will huddle in the Capitol on Thursday for a two-hour conference meeting designed to reach a consensus on the hot-button issue. If none emerges, then more Republicans are expected to sign on to a discharge petition that would force a series of contentious immigration votes on the House floor as early as June 25. Before lawmakers left town for the Memorial Day recess, two more Republicans endorsed the petition — meaning just two more GOP signatures are needed to reach the magic number of 218 if all Democrats sign on. ‘We`re adding votes every single day. We`re engaged in conversations to figure out, is there another path? I don`t believe there is,’ Rep. Will Hurd (Texas), one of the moderate Republicans leading the discharge petition effort, told CBS`s ‘Face the Nation’ on Sunday.”



Cruz, Alexander conducting poll for Senate agenda - Politico: “Republican senators aren’t sure what to do between now and the November elections. So they’re conducting a poll — of themselves. Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee have been quietly circulating an unusual ‘survey’ of their colleagues in recent weeks asking about their level of support for dozens of legislative proposals, some of them highly controversial. The areas under consideration include taking another stab at repealing and scaling back Obamacare; trying for Round 2 of tax cuts; eliminating or reining in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; defunding Planned Parenthood and other anti-abortion rights measures; instituting work requirements for federal welfare programs; expanding gun rights; instituting budget reforms; and dozens more. Yet the Cruz-Alexander poll will likely show that Obamacare repeal still can’t get 50 GOP votes, according to Republican sources who’ve already taken the temperature of the caucus, and that any proposal to make the Trump tax cuts permanent couldn’t clear the 60-vote filibuster bar.”

**RUBS TEMPLES**

Harper’s Bazaar: “In a turn of events that read like an episode of Charmed, it`s been revealed that Louis Vuitton employs a professional shaman (or wizard of good and evil spirits) from Brazil to ensure the weather at their [annual outdoor fashion shows] always remains impeccable. Who would`ve thought? According to The Guardian, the unidentified shaman also commanded the weather at LV`s Cruise shows in Rio and Kyoto. While menacing clouds threatened for the duration of the show, rain did indeed hold off—unlike Dior`s outdoor Cruise 2019 show in Chantilly, which fell victim to an unfortunate downpour. Vogue Runway also reported that the Brazilian-based shaman flies only private, and commands a six-figure fee for ensuring the weather remains precipitation-free. And, just when we thought we`d heard it all, the shaman reportedly worked his magic at Meghan and Harry`s Windsor Castle nuptials last month (resulting in beaming sunlight all day long).”

"The battle for control of the U.S. House of Representatives began in earnest Tuesday as voters in California – America’s most populous state – joined voters in seven others states to cast ballots in primaries to pick nominees for the Nov. 6 general election.

California currently is represented by 39 Democrats and 14 Republicans in the House, making it the biggest electoral prize in the nation. But races in the other states where primaries were held Tuesday – Alabama, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota – could also help determine whether the House and Senate have Democratic or Republican majorities in 2019. The GOP currently has majorities in both chambers.

If one or both houses of Congress pass from Republican to Democratic control, President Trump would have a much harder time winning approval for his legislative agenda, and could be faced with a threat of impeachment by the House.

California is not just the state with the biggest congressional delegation, but the state with an unusual primary setup, where the top two vote getters in each contest – regardless of party – will face one another in November. That means in some races up and down the ballot voters could have two Democrats or two Republicans on the general election ballot.

If one or both houses of Congress pass from Republican to Democratic control, President Trump would have a much harder time winning approval for his legislative agenda, and could be faced with a threat of impeachment by the House.

The Democrats’ hopes to regain control of the House, which they lost in 2010, rest in no small part on how they do in the nation’s biggest state.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s Democratic Party needs to flip a net of at least 24 House seats across the nation to make the California representative speaker of the House once again. Events in her home state are key to what happens in the fall for several reasons.

First, there are seven House seats spread across the state currently represented by Republicans that Hillary Clinton carried in the race for president in 2016. Democrats are eager to capture them in the general election.

If some congressional districts select two Democrats as the top finishers, that will put Democrats closer to their goal of recapturing the House. That’s possible, for example, in the open Anaheim-area 39th District held for many years by retiring Republican Ed Royce.

Equally of interest is how the two slots for California’s November gubernatorial contest will be filled. One will almost certainly go to current Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom. The polls suggest the race for the other slot is tight between a Democrat and a Republican.

The Republican who could get on the ballot for governor is businessman John Cox, who had the endorsement of President Trump. The Democrat is former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa who, late in the primary cycle, began to draw support from a few high-profile Republicans who find him preferable to Newsom – and think Cox can’t beat Newsom.

The possibility of ending up with two Democrats in the California gubernatorial contest does not bode well for the GOP. Most surveys show voters think the vote for governor is the most important ballot they cast after their vote for president. So it will be hard to motivate Republicans to turn out in November when they can’t really make a difference in the state’s most important race.

If Republican voters stay home, they won’t be casting votes the GOP needs to win critical congressional races in the Golden State.

Meanwhile, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein looks to be cruising to a strong first-place finish in the primary to keep her seat against her expected opponent, former State Senate President Kevin de Leon, also a Democrat. De Leon could give Feinstein a tough race in November, coming at her from the Bernie Sanders’ left.

In other states:

ALABAMA

Alabama interim GOP Gov. Kay Ivey – who took office upon the resignation of her Republican predecessor – looked to be headed to an easy win in the race for her party’s nomination. She will go into the general election a heavy favorite against the Democrat picked to run against her.

A closely watched congressional race in Alabama is the Republican primary in the state’s 2nd District, which runs from Dothan and the Gulf Coast up to the suburbs of Montgomery.

Incumbent Martha Roby – who upset some Republican voters after she condemned President Trump for his “Access Hollywood” tape – was fighting to keep her seat in what has turned out to be a strong challenge from the man she beat when first elected, former Democrat turned Republican Bobby Bright.

IOWA

In Iowa, interim Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds – who replaced Terry Branstad as governor when President Trump appointed Branstad U.S. ambassador to China – ran unopposed for the GOP gubernatorial nomination and is a heavy favorite to win a term on her own.

The Hawkeye State has no U.S. Senate race this year. Only one of the state’s four incumbent House members – Republican Steve King – is considered safe. GOP incumbents David Young in the 3rd District (in the southwestern corner of the state) and Rod Blum (in northeastern Iowa’s 1st District) may have tough contests in the fall, even though both were unopposed in the primary.

In the 2nd district, which is in the southeastern part of the state and includes Iowa City, Democrat Dave Loebsack – who, like his Republican general election challenger Chris Peters ran unopposed it the primary – will have to contest with an electorate that sent him to Washington for sixth time, while Donald Trump carried for the district by just over 4 points.

MISSISSIPPI

Mississippi has two U.S. Senate seats to be decided in November, but only the seat held by Republican Roger Wicker was affected by Tuesday’s primary. Early returns indicated Wicker easily prevailed in his primary and enters the race favored to win against whichever Democrat wins the primary. The contest for the seat that came vacant upon the retirement of longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran will be decided at a later date.

MONTANA

In Montana there were four Republicans on the ballot seeking the right to take on two-term incumbent Democrat Jon Tester in the race for U.S. Senate, with state Auditor Matt Rosendale considered by many to be the favorite.

President Trump carried the state in 2016 by more than 200,000 votes and has singled out Tester as someone he’d like to see replaced. But Tester’s numbers are good. Reports Tuesday that absentee balloting and turnout in the primary were both high, meaning voter enthusiasm may be carrying forward from the last election to the next.

NEW JERSEY

In New Jersey, Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez was projected to win nomination for another term, probably against pharmaceutical executive Bob Hugin running for the Republicans.

Menendez may be tainted by ethics problems that should render him vulnerable, but the state GOP is still in disarray after the drubbing it took in last year’s gubernatorial elections. It also doesn’t help that there are at least 10 seats in the U.S. Senate currently held by Democrats that are just better targets.

The Garden State is also home to a seat which went one way for Congress and the opposite way for president in 2016: the 5th District, in the northern part of the state, went for Trump by 1 point while sending Democrat Josh Gottheimer to Congress.

In the 7th District in 2016, Republican Leonard Lance won his seat on the Pennsylvania side of the state by 11 points as Clinton was carrying it 48.6 to 47.5 percent. How those seats go in November, as well as the outcome in the race in northern New Jersey’s open 11th Congressional District, could depend heavily on the outcome of Tuesday’s primaries.

NEW MEXICO

In New Mexico, Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce from the 2nd Congressional District, which covers the southern half of the state, and Democrat U.S. Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham from the Albuquerque-centered 1st District will likely face one another in the fall contest to replace term-limited GOP Gov. Susanna Martinez, the nation’s only currently serving Hispanic chief executive.

The seats Lujan Grisham and Pearce are vacating are reliably partisan, so the outcome of the congressional primaries will likely determine who the winner will be in November.

SOUTH DAKOTA

Finally, in South Dakota, voters will be picking a new governor in the fall. On the GOP side the choice is between Kristi Noem, the state’s lone member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and state Attorney General Marty Jackley in a race that started ugly and ended even uglier.

Democrat Billie Sutton ran unopposed for his party’s nomination for governor, as did the party’s congressional candidate, Tim Bjorkman. There are three candidates in the Republican primary to replace Noem in a House seat the GOP is favored to retain, given that Trump carried the state by better than 30 points and 100,000 votes in 2016.", Will Tuesday`s primaries (especially in California) break Democrats` hearts or leave Republicans in tears? ,6-2018
"Neither party managed to land any knockout blows in California Tuesday as voters went to the polls there and in seven other states to pick candidates who will face off in the Nov. 6 midterm elections, when control of the U.S. House and Senate will be up for grabs.

The fate of President Trump’s legislative priorities will hang in the balance in November. Right now Republicans control both the House and Senate, but a swing of just 23 seats would give Democrats a House majority. The GOP holds a narrow majority of 51 seats in the Senate, with Democrats controlling 47 seats and independents who caucus with Democrats holding two seats.

California, home to the nation’s largest congressional delegation with 39 Democrats and 14 Republicans, has a so-called “jungle primary.” All candidates initially competed on a single ballot Tuesday. The two who come out on top go on to the general election, regardless of political party. This makes it possible for two Democrats or two Republicans to face each other in November.

The Democrats had hoped the jungle primary might give them a leg up on their campaign to win back control of the U.S. House of Representatives by capturing at least a few of the 14 seats the GOP currently holds in California – half of which Hillary Clinton carried in the 2016 presidential contest.

What analysts have missed all over the country is that while the Democrats are able to maintain political power in places like the Golden State, they’ve not be able to stop the state’s slide into economic and social oblivion.

Going into Tuesday it looked like there might be a few seats – notably the Anaheim-area seat of retiring Republican Ed Royce – where the Republicans might be shut out of the general election.

That appears not to have happened – not in the Royce seat, not in the San Diego-area seat of retiring GOP Rep. Darrell Issa, and not in Huntington Beach where Republican Dana Rohrabacher, a former speechwriter for President Reagan seeking a 16th term, easily made it into the next round.

The failure to achieve what some were calling a “big, blue shutout” also didn’t extend to the gubernatorial contest. Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom easily advanced to the second round of balloting as did Republican businessman John Cox, who had the endorsement of President Trump.

Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa – whom some hoped might make it into the runoff in place of Cox, setting up an all-Democratic general election contest that could have had a depressive affect on GOP turnout statewide – drew only about half as much support as Cox and finished a distant third.

This is quite a turnaround from what people were expecting even just months ago. The Trump presidency, in the considered opinion of some political experts, should have been the final nail in the coffin of the once robust, Reagan-producing, California GOP.

It might still. The latest figures show there are more voters in the state who’ve chosen to register as unaffiliated than who signed up as Republicans, with people blaming everything from the national party’s stance on immigration and abortion to the Trump tweets for the GOP’s weakness.

What analysts have missed all over the country is that while the Democrats are able to maintain political power in places like the Golden State, they’ve not be able to stop the state’s slide into economic and social oblivion.

Another factor is President Trump himself. His national approval numbers in polls have risen to a point somewhere in the mid-to-upper 40s, much higher than many analysts thought and most Democrats believed he’d ever be.

That means the suburban, college-educated, mostly white, Republican married women who appeared to desert Trump in droves in November 2016 (and who either voted for Clinton or just didn’t vote) may be starting to come home to the GOP, at least as far as voting for other Republicans is concerned.

This analysis is supported by two other figures, both of which presage a competitive, perhaps even victorious national GOP effort in the fall. The Real Clear Politics average has nearly 40 percent of those surveyed saying the country is “on the right track.” That’s about 13 points better than what it was during President Obama’s last year in the White House.

The number of people who say America is “headed in the wrong direction” is also down by about a third from where it was at the end of the Obama era.

That’s not a ringing endorsement for things as they are, but it does suggest the next national election will not be a “change” election like the last one was. Voters seem to like their tax cut and approve of the fact the country’s economic engine has restarted.

People are going back to work, the unemployment rate among all Americans is the lowest in decades and the black and Latino unemployment rates have never been this low since statistics have been compiled.

All that news helps incumbents, which this year means the GOP. The generic ballot test, where voters are asked whether they intend to vote for a Republican or a Democrat in the next election, is now just about even. Several months ago, before the tax cut passed and in the thick of unending daily chaos coming out of the White House, the Democrats had a double-digit advantage.

All this carries over into other states that held primaries on Tuesday. This was true in places like New Jersey, where the president has problems, and in the “Trump Country” states of South Dakota, Alabama and Montana.

In other states:

ALABAMA

Alabama interim GOP Gov. Kay Ivey – who took office upon the resignation of her Republican predecessor – easily won nomination for her own term. She goes into the general election a heavy favorite against Democrat Walt Maddox.

In the closely watched Republican primary in the state’s 2nd District, which runs from Dothan and the Gulf Coast up to the suburbs of Montgomery, incumbent Martha Roby – who upset some Republican voters after she condemned President Trump for his “Access Hollywood” tape – was forced into a runoff against the man she beat when first elected, former Democrat turned Republican Bobby Bright.

IOWA

In Iowa, interim Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds – who replaced Terry Branstad as governor when President Trump appointed Branstad U.S. ambassador to China – ran unopposed for the GOP gubernatorial nomination and is a heavy favorite to win a term on her own.

The Hawkeye State has no U.S. Senate race this year. Only one of the state’s four incumbent House members – Republican Steve King – is considered safe. GOP incumbents David Young in the 3rd District (in the southwestern corner of the state) and Rod Blum (in northeastern Iowa’s 1st District) may have tough contests in the fall, even though both were unopposed in the primary.

In the 2nd District, which is in the southeastern part of the state and includes Iowa City, Democrat Dave Loebsack – who, like his Republican general election challenger Chris Peters ran unopposed it the primary – will have to contest with an electorate that sent him to Washington for sixth time, while Donald Trump carried for the district by just over 4 points.

MISSISSIPPI

Mississippi has two U.S. Senate seats to be decided in November, but only the seat held by Republican Roger Wicker was affected by Tuesday’s primary. Wicker easily prevailed in his primary and enters the race favored to win against either Democrats Howard Sherman or David Baria, who will fight it out in a runoff election later this year.

The contest for the seat that came vacant upon the retirement of longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran will be decided at a later date.

MONTANA

In Montana, state Auditor Matt Rosendale emerged from a field of four to win outright the chance to take on two-term incumbent Democrat Jon Tester in the race for U.S. Senate.

President Trump carried the state in 2016 by more than 200,000 votes and has singled out Tester as someone he’d like to see replaced. But Tester’s numbers are good. Absentee balloting and turnout in the primary were both high, meaning voter enthusiasm may be carrying forward from the last election to the next.

NEW JERSEY

In New Jersey, Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez won renomination, taking 62 percent of the vote against a relative unknown. He’ll face Republican pharmaceutical executive Bob Hugin in the fall.

Menendez may be tainted by ethics problems that should render him vulnerable, but the state GOP is still in disarray after the drubbing it took in last year’s gubernatorial elections. It also doesn’t help that there are at least 10 seats in the U.S. Senate currently held by Democrats that are just better targets.

The Garden State is also home to two seats which went one way for Congress and the opposite way for president in 2016. In one, the 5th District, which sits like a cap across most of the top of the state, Trump beat Hillary Clinton by a single point while Democrat Josh Gottheimer was picked to go to Congress. This time Gottheimer will face Republican John McCann, who won the GOP primary 53 to 47 percent.

In the 7th District in 2016, Republican Leonard Lance won his seat on the Pennsylvania side of the state by 11 points, as Clinton was carrying it 48.6 to 47.5 percent. In November he’ll face Democrat Tom Malinowski.

These seats are on the watch list kept by both parties, at least for now, as is northern New Jersey’s open 11th Congressional District. That’s a longtime GOP stronghold where voters picked former state Republican Chairman Jay Webber and Democrat Mikie Sherrill as the nominees for November.

NEW MEXICO

In New Mexico, Republican Rep. Steve Pearce from the 2nd Congressional District, which covers the southern half of the state, and Democrat Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham from the Albuquerque-centered 1st District will face one another in the fall contest to replace term-limited GOP Gov. Susanna Martinez, the nation’s only currently serving Hispanic chief executive.

The seats Lujan Grisham and Pearce are vacating are reliably partisan, so the outcome of the congressional primaries will likely determine who the winner will be in November. The U.S. Senate race, where Democrat Martin Heinrich is seeking a second term, is not expected to develop into much of a contest.

SOUTH DAKOTA

Finally, in South Dakota, GOP voters picked Republican Kristi Noem, the state’s lone member of the U.S. House of Representatives as their candidate for governor. Noem easily defeated state Attorney General Marty Jackley in a race that started ugly and ended even uglier. If elected she would become the state’s first woman governor.

Democrat Billie Sutton ran unopposed for his party’s nomination for governor, as did the party’s congressional candidate, Tim Bjorkman. Looking to replace Noem in the House is Republican Dusty Johnson, who starts the race a prohibitive favorite, given Trump carried the state by better than 30 points and 100,000 votes in 2016."," California breaks Democrats` hearts: `Big, blue shutout` fails and other takeaways from Tuesday`s primaries ",6-2018
"The results in Tuesday`s primaries in eight states are an early indication that President Trump`s ""America First"" agenda and accomplishments are winning the support of the American people. This is good news for Republicans running in the Nov. 6 midterm elections.

The Trump agenda of economic growth, job creation, border security, and peace through strength abroad is causing voters to seriously consider the consequences of supporting candidates who carry the Democratic mantle of tax hikes, protecting sanctuary cities, and the hyper-partisan and baseless impeachment witch hunt.

In California, it will be hard for Democrats to point to evidence that a blue wave is coming in November. In congressional districts 39, 45 and 48 – all key pieces of the puzzle for a Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives – Republican candidates received over 50 percent of the vote in the “jungle primary” system.

With Democrats clinging to a meager 3 percent advantage in generic ballot polling averages, picking up the 23 House seats necessary to win a Democratic majority looks like it will be more difficult than expected.

Fresh off one of the best jobs reports in years, voters came to the polls in the eight states where primaries were held with growing optimism and a feeling that there is reason to feel good again in America.

Democrats also failed in their quest to send two open-border liberals to the general election in the California gubernatorial contest. Republican businessman John Cox captured second place, due to strong support from President Trump.

Cox will be a strong advocate for the president`s pro-growth economic record in California. This will be a sharp contrast to Democrat Gavin Newsom`s ultra-liberal objectives, which will only continue California`s charge into the abyss.

Also worth noting is that a Democratic state senator in California was recalled for voting for gas tax increases, costing California Democrats the supermajority in the Legislature necessary to raise taxes even more.

Fresh off one of the best jobs reports in years, voters came to the polls in the eight states where primaries were held with growing optimism and a feeling that there is reason to feel good again in America.

Hardworking Americans understand full well that voting for a Democrat for the U.S. House or U.S. Senate is a vote against the Trump prosperity and security agenda that has paved the way for the lowest unemployment rate in 18 years (3.8 percent), the highest consumer confidence in 17 years, the decimation of ISIS, and the return of American respect around the globe.

When folks consider the fact that nearly 3 million jobs have been created since President Trump took office, they are rightly nervous to give House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the chance to once again become speaker of the House with a Democratic majority.

In the Republican Senate primary in Montana, conservative state Auditor Matt Rosendale prevailed in a crowded field. Rosendale, a statewide elected official and strong supporter of President Trump`s agenda, will give Montanans a clear choice in November in a state that President Trump carried by a whopping 20 points in 2016.

The people of Montana can re-elect anti-Trump Democratic Sen. Jon Tester – who has become Cryin` Chuck Schumer`s puppet in the D.C. swamp – or vote for Rosendale, a reform-minded Washington outsider.

In New Jersey, Republicans nominated Republican businessman and Washington outsider Bob Hugin. He will be a formidable candidate matched up against ethically challenged career politician Bob Menendez.

A contested Senate race in deep blue New Jersey is something that national Democrats did not count on and will certainly make their pathway to a Senate majority that much more difficult.

The Tuesday primary results from California to Montana to New Jersey are cause for concern for the Democrats.

Voters showed that they appreciate it when politicians make promises and keep them. President Trump is making good on his campaign pledges. Voters are happy with our nation`s economic outlook and want it to continue. And they are tired of the two-year, $17 million phony Russia collusion investigation.

As a result, Washington Democrats with no positive agenda for the American people will have a very hard time convincing voters to overturn the Republican majorities in the House and Senate.

If Bill Clinton is asked what matters most to voters on his book tour, he would undoubtedly say that it`s still ""the economy stupid!""

President Trump and the Republicans in Congress understand this and are focused like a laser beam on continuing the unprecedented progress that`s been made. The Democrats, on the other hand, are in the wilderness with no plans of turning back."," David Bossie: Sorry, Democrats, primary results prove that Trump’s agenda is a smash hit ",6-2018

It was only the Senate which canceled the August recess. And the Senate only eliminated part of the recess. It’s far from clear what the Senate may accomplish. And, not everyone in Washington is even convinced the Senate will linger in session in August much at all.

Most voters don’t check the Senate’s webpage to see what cloture petitions are ripening and which nominations are in the queue for Senate business on a given day. They don’t watch gavel-to-gavel coverage of the Senate on C-SPAN2. Many can’t even tell you the names of both of their senators.



But the the public hears that Congress is working. And that’s all that matters. Senate Republicans may have already won the optics war when it comes to “cancelling recess.”

To be clear, it was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who decided that the Senate - not the House – would forgo four of the five weeks designated for the hallowed “August recess.”

“Due to the historic obstruction by Senate Democrats of the president’s nominees, and the goal of passing appropriations bills prior to the end of the fiscal year, the August recess has been canceled. Senators should expect to remain in session in August to pass legislation, including appropriations bills, and to make additional progress on the president’s nominees,” said McConnell.

“I’m damn glad,” opined Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., about the schedule change. “Louisianans understand that good things come to those who work their ass off. I’m ready to work nights. Weekends. All of August. Christmas. Whatever it takes.”

But some are unsure whether the “August recess” gambit is really about getting work done or not. Democrats note that of the 33 Senate seats up this year, 24 fall on their side of the aisle. Meantime Republicans must only defend nine seats.

Many of the Democratic seats are in battleground or GOP-leaning states like Indiana, West Virginia and Montana. Most of the Republican seats are in solid conservative states. So, leashing vulnerable Democrats to Washington to prevent them from campaigning may not be a bad strategy if you want to boost a narrow 51-49 GOP seat advantage in the Senate…if that’s in fact the tactic.

Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, suggested none of this matters. The politics. The perception. He says there’s actual work to do.

“Other than perhaps us here inside the Beltway, folks back home really couldn’t give a flip,” said Cornyn.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, embraced the new schedule. He said Democrats would use the time to wrestle with health care and rising premiums.

“We welcome the opportunity to address it and we’re going to work very hard in August to require our Republican colleagues to do something about it,” said Schumer.

Such a path could be fraught with peril. First of all, Democrats don’t control the Senate floor. Secondly, health care polls highly as an issue important to voters. Democrats may want to fix some of the problems. But it’s risky for Democrats to overplay their hand on this. After all, it was Democrats who passed Obamacare – the root of many problems in the current health care system. Forcing a debate about health care just before the midterm elections could rekindle negative views voters still harbor about the Affordable Care Act.

That could spark a backlash against Democratic senators who voted for the law like vulnerable Democrats like Sens. Jon Tester, D-Mont., Bill Nelson, D-Fla., Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who voted for the health care law. Moreover, a debate on health care could help boost a last-ditch effort by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Bill Cassidy, R-La., to fully repeal and replace Obamacare. Graham and Cassidy tried their health care maneuver last September. The rejuvenation of the health care debate could prompt a similar scenario this year just before the midterms if Democrats overplay their hand.

It was President Trump who demanded the Senate labor in Washington this August. And so Schumer turned the tables on the President.

“Now that the Majority Leader has acceded to President Trump’s demands on the August schedule, We want the President to be here in Washington working with us as well because he has caused a lot of these problems, said Schumer. “We presume he won’t be jetting off to Bedminster or Mar-a-Lago or spending countless hours on the golf course.”

Whether Mr. Trump acquiesces to Schumer’s request is unclear. But Democrats created an interesting political wedge to deploy against the President and Republicans. And despite all of the breathlessness about August, many aren’t sure how much the Senate will truly be here.

Last year, McConnell announced in mid-July the Senate would remain in session for half of the August recess. They wound up working three and a half days and then bolted for the month after senators reached a deal to confirm a slate of 77 nominees.

McConnell made the announcement about August this year in early June. The decision was a GOP shot across the bow of Democrats: back off their requirement that the Senate burn inordinate hours each week on routine nominations. Relent and perhaps you won’t have to hang out in Washington come August.

Schumer argues Democrats aren’t making life difficult for GOP nominees.

“Mitch McConnell can’t have it both ways. He spends all of his time bragging to his base that they’ve confirmed more judges than anyone else and now he’s saying they haven’t confirmed enough,” said Schumer.

Still, McConnell’s announcement in June about the August threat gives leaders nearly two months to reach a pact on nominations. Or, they may even forge an arrangement where the Senate appears it’s in session a lot in August - and it is. But the Senate only convenes with a skeletal staff with most senators only returning once or twice a week to cast roll call votes.

This is why the August plan may just be about optics.

“Congress needs to do its job,” said Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., the most-vulnerable Republican senator this midterm cycle.

If there’s a GOP senator who needs to spend time campaigning this year, it’s Heller. Still, saying the right things about working in Washington in August resonates with voters.

“If that means we that we need to remain on the floor of the U.S. Senate on the weekends, overnight and through the month of August to make more progress, then we should do it,” said Heller.

But retiring Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., was more skeptical of the purported August workaholicism.

“I doubt we’ll be there the whole time,” said Flake. “Typically when people smell jet fumes, they find a way to be a little more cooperative.”

In other words, senators will get an itch to run to the airport and fly home to campaign, go on family vacations or work stateside on important issues. That’s why the dam broke last year. Senators reached an accord and remained in Washington less than a handful of days rather than 14.

So McConnell cancelled the August recess. It’s off in the minds of most people even if the reality doesn’t match the rhetoric. We’ll know soon if it’s a mirage. A political illusion caused by light refraction superheated by the sweltering asphalt of the nation’s capital in August.

"Donald Trump Jr. headlined Montana`s Republican Party convention on Friday, stumping for state auditor Matt Rosendale, a former state lawmaker now running for a U.S. Senate seat.

The seat is currently held by Sen. John Tester, a Democrat who drew President Donald Trump`s ire earlier this year by criticizing Dr. Ronny Jackson, the former presidential physician whom the president had nominated to head the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Jackson ultimately withdrew his nomination after facing allegations of misconduct and mismanagment. Soon after, he also ceased being the president`s physician.

On Friday, the president`s son told the convention gathering in Billings that Rosendale was the best choice to replace Tester.

""I`m the son of a billionaire from New York City and I have much more of a Montana platform than the senator, the senior senator from this state. That doesn`t make much sense,"" Trump Jr. told the crowd of several hundred Republicans.

""I`m the son of a billionaire from New York City and I have much more of a Montana platform than the senator, the senior senator from this state. That doesn`t make much sense."" - Donald Trump Jr., campaigning for Matt Rosendale, a U.S. Senate candidate in Montana

Rosendale prevailed June 5 in a four-way primary election after outside political groups spent several million dollars promoting his candidacy and attacking his Republican opponents.

In a Twitter message earlier this month, Trump Jr. wrote that Rosendale would back President Donald Trump`s “America First agenda 100%.”

In 2016, candidate Donald Trump captured Montana by 20 percentage points.

The president’s son was joined onstage by U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte and Rosendale.

Tester has not backed away from the actions he took against Jackson and said in a recent interview that he would welcome a trip by the president to Montana.

""I did my job as a U.S. senator. We vetted him (Jackson) we asked questions, we didn`t get any answers and he pulled out,"" Tester said. ""I hope (President Trump) comes to Montana. I really do. I hope he comes and looks at some of the veterans clinics we have, here some of the infrastructure needs and some of the border security challenges we have on our Northern border.""

Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, has defended how Tester handled the release of the allegations against former VA nominee Jackson, according to the Hill.

"Nearly a dozen people suspected of traveling through Mexico to the U.S. border as part of the immigrant ""caravan"" from Central America are now facing new complaints for immigration-related violations, including entering the U.S. illegally.

A federal law enforcement official told Fox News on Monday that the Justice Department has filed complaints against 11 suspected members of the caravan.

MEMBERS OF MIGRANT CARAVAN REMAIN DEFIANT AFTER US AGAIN DENIES BORDER ENTRY

Most of the defendants allegedly entered the U.S. illegally, which is a misdemeanor. One defendant is accused of having entered the U.S. after having previously been deported, which is a felony.

Defendants, according to the probable cause statement, were seen near an area known to border patrol agents as ""Goat Canyon,"" roughly four miles from the San Ysidro port of entry in San Diego, California.

Two of those facing new complaints are Salvadorans, six are Hondurans and three are Guatemalans.

The ""caravan"" of Central Americans started moving toward North America on March 25. The group of around 200 immigrants traveled through Mexico to the U.S. in an effort to seek asylum at the American border.

Most of those who have been trying to enter the U.S. remain stalled in Mexico after Customs and Border Protection said Sunday that the agency ""reached capacity at the San Ysidro port of entry for CBP officers to be able to bring additional persons traveling without appropriate entry documentation into the port of entry for processing.""

President Trump, who has often tweeted about the immigrants, said Monday night that the ""`caravan` that is openly defying our border shows how weak & ineffective U.S. immigration laws are.""

He added that ""Democrats like Jon Tester continue to support the open borders agenda – Tester even voted to protect Sanctuary Cities. We need lawmakers who will put America First.""

Trump called for Tester, the Montana seantor, to resign on Saturday following a White House report disputing his allegations against the president`s pick for the next secretary of Veterans Affairs, Adm. Ronny Jackson. Jackson ultimately withdrew.

On the roster: Roseanne Barr and the new political correctness - Garrett drops re-election bid due to alcoholism - Bipartisan lawmakers in talks to revive DACA bill - Trump accuses Mueller’s Dems of meddling - Bro…

ROSEANNE BARR AND THE NEW POLITICAL CORRECTNESS

Who knew that making a professional vulgarian and an infamous kook a face of your political movement could be so risky?



There will be many millions of pixels wasted in the name of debating whether ABC was right or wrong to terminate Roseanne Barr’s eponymous sitcom after the comedian likened a former White House official of black ancestry to an ape.

If you feel obliged to have an opinion on that subject your view is likely shaped by your politics and is therefore something of a foregone conclusion. The same goes for your estimation of her show in the first place.

So powerful is the draw of political tribalism that people are now increasingly able to turn their tastes on a dime in order to conform with what is politically correct.

Barr’s act in the show that it produced is all about being shocking. It was shocking when she spit and grabbed her way through the national anthem and it was shocking when she and her TV character so brutally assaulted conventional norms about middle class marriage and family.

A generation ago she was admired on the left for skewering June Cleaver expectations for media moms. This time around her admirers have been mostly on the right since she has adopted her support for President Trump as her preferred outraged generation device.

Like a lot of middle aged white dudes who suddenly started appreciating Kanye West’s rhymes, Trump supporters were excited to see someone who unabashedly rooted for the president, even if it was just an exercise in trolling liberals. After all it seems like that’s the point of a lot of what Republicans do these days. It tends to matter less whether something is good or bad or even congruent with a philosophy as much as it matters that something will “make heads explode.”

Similarly, Democrats express strange new respect for ultra conservative Republicans, like Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., or even Attorney General Jeff Sessions when they bedevil Trump. And political correctness in cultural choices has a much longer history on the left side of the aisle. Surely no living human could endure a set of Kathy Griffin’s comedy unless they believe they were doing it for a political cause.

But now, Republicans are fully engaged in the act. This isn’t just the wistful nostalgia of Pat Boone or Wayne Newton from the Reagan era. This is full blown art as cultural weapon.

If you are fool enough to allow strangers to dictate your likes or dislikes in music, movies, books and television there’s not much we can tell you. You drank the Kool-Aid and are mixing up another pitcher.

We don’t know whether or not the president will stay strong with Barr in light of her racist remark. Her comment came in support of the kind of batty conspiracy theories in which some in the president’s orbit – and sometimes the president himself – have trafficked.

Trump has in the past defended racists and kooks who were part of his broader political tribe. This is, after all, a guy who gave an interview to Alex Jones.

And it’s potentially useful for Trump to embrace the idea of Barr as a victim. This would work well with his general narrative that middle class white voters are being persecuted. There are obvious down sides in aligning oneself with someone with a record like Barr’s, but the president has already taken that leap with her. If whole controversy creates an enormous, divisive uproar, then it would fit very well with the president’s overall political style.

It is too late to try to get politics out of art and popular culture. When you are at a point where Taylor Swift is criticized for not taking political positions, you know that we are not going back to the old, more pleasant arrangement where people did not much know or care about the political views of their preferred entertainers.

Politics and culture are kind of like government and religion: Both are harmed by their co-mingling.

It`s fine to debate whether or not Barr is too nasty to be on prime time television. It’s even possible that some good might come from such a discussion.

And it’s understandable that people feel greater sympathy for those who feel sympathy for them. But what makes no sense is ever giving up your own taste in art to meet the expectations of your fellow partisans.



THE RULEBOOK: IT’S IN THE DETAILS

“Sense, perception, judgment, desire, volition, memory, imagination, are found to be separated by such delicate shades and minute gradations that their boundaries have eluded the most subtle investigations, and remain a pregnant source of ingenious disquisition and controversy.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 37



TIME OUT: ‘THEY CALL ME BABY DRIVER…’

WSJ: “Over time, many other antiquated auto features have been ruthlessly abandoned—hand-crank starters and windows, carburetors and cassette decks. But stick-shifting has defiantly stuck around, joining ax throwing, rock climbing and ultramarathons as an activity people stubbornly enjoy despite its needless difficulty. … Thomas Plucinsky, a company representative for BMW, ‘There is no longer a logical reason to shift manually.’ Cars with automatic transmissions accelerate faster, drive more smoothly and get better fuel economy than stick shifts, he pointed out. One could argue that manually shifting a modern car makes about as much sense as milling your own flour, building a fire to heat your home or drawing water from a well. Even many pro drivers race automatics these days. … But many people still buy stick shift cars for ‘emotional reasons,’ Mr. Plucinsky said. ‘They enjoy the mechanical feedback, which is part of the fun of driving even if they are just commuting to work.’”

GARRETT DROPS RE-ELECTION BID DUE TO ALCOHOLISM

WaPo: “Rep. Thomas Garrett (R-Va.) announced Monday that he is struggling with alcoholism and will abandon his run for a second term in Congress so he can focus on recovery and his family. Garrett, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, is the 48th Republican to retire or announce they will not seek reelection to the House this year, according to a list maintained by the House Press Gallery. Many are leaving in anticipation of a strong Democratic performance in congressional races this fall and out of frustration with partisan politics in Washington. Garrett, 46, was facing a robust challenge from his Democratic opponent, journalist and author Leslie Cockburn, who had raised more money and had more cash on hand than he had. In recent days, unnamed former staffers had accused him and his wife of mistreating staff who worked in his congressional office. But in a videotaped statement, Garrett, a former Virginia state senator, said his departure from politics was spurred by his addiction.”

Distillery owner first to enter race to replace Garrett - WaPo: “Hours after Rep. Tom Garrett (R-Va.) made the surprise announcement that he will not seek reelection in central Virginia, potential candidates began jockeying to replace him and one officially entered the race. Denver Riggleman, a former Air Force intelligence officer and distillery owner who ran a short-lived campaign for governor last year, said he is seeking the Republican nomination to help pass President Trump’s agenda in Congress. ‘As we have all seen over the past few years, it takes a real outsider with real world experience to drag the swamp monsters to dry land,’ he said in a statement. ‘As a veteran and small business owner, I am perfectly suited for that task.’ Riggleman is the first candidate to publicly confirm he will run after Garrett announced his struggle with alcoholism, but there is a long list of other potential candidates, including four from the General Assembly.”

Trump to hold rally in Nashville tonight - AP: “Trump is traveling to Nashville, Tennessee, on Tuesday to raise campaign cash for Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn, the party’s leading U.S. Senate hopeful in Tennessee, and to headline a rally with his most loyal supporters. Blackburn is expected to face Democratic former Gov. Phil Bredesen to replace Republican Sen. Bob Corker, who is retiring. The Tennessee campaign is among several races crucial to Trump’s plans to maintain control of the Senate, where Republicans are defending a narrow two-seat majority. Trump is planning a series of political rallies and events in the coming months to boost Republicans and brand Democrats as obstructionists to his agenda.”

Montana Senate race gets boost from outside cash - AP: “Outside money is pouring into Montana’s U.S. Senate race even before Republicans settle on a nominee to challenge Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, who has become a leading target of the GOP after drawing the fury of President Donald Trump. Four Republicans are jockeying for a last-minute advantage ahead of the June 5 primary. Their ambitions to topple the two-term incumbent were buoyed after Trump — who won in Montana by 20 percentage points — unloaded on Tester for releasing allegations that the president’s pick for head of the Department of Veterans Affairs loosely handed out prescription drugs and got drunk on duty. Among Tester’s would-be challengers, state auditor Matt Rosendale has emerged as the favorite of deep-pocketed conservative donors. Outside groups including two bankrolled by Illinois billionaire Richard Uihlein have spent $1.8 million pumping Rosendale’s candidacy. That’s almost twice as much as he’s raised himself.”

Vulnerable Dems say banking law is proof of their ‘independence from Washington’ - The Hill: “Three vulnerable Senate Democrats hailing from states President Trump won in the 2016 election are touting their work on a new bipartisan banking law, portraying it as proof of their independence in Washington. Democratic Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), Jon Tester (Mont.) and Joe Donnelly (Ind.) co-authored the bipartisan legislation, signed by Trump on Thursday, that eases the regulatory oversight imposed on banks and credit unions by the Dodd-Frank Act. The senators say their bill is a prime example of their ability to work across party lines and solve problems, a message they are eager to bring back to voters in their home states. … Yet whether the law will turn into electoral gold remains to be seen. The banking industry remains deeply unpopular, and liberal activists have assailed the new law as a giveaway to the financial industry.”

Gov. Hogan releases first ad in reelection campaign - WaPo: “Gov. Larry Hogan released the first television advertisement of his reelection campaign Monday, part of a $1.3 million advertising blitz ahead of the gubernatorial primary that is costing substantially more than some of his leading Democratic opponents have in the bank. With four weeks until the June 26 primary, Hogan and Lt. Gov. Boyd K. Rutherford have $9 million cash on hand and no Republican primary opponents. Their first television ad, which will air on broadcast and cable stations, highlights Hogan’s record on the economy and environmental issues, including efforts to improve the health of the Chesapeake Bay.”

Millennial midterm candidates starting strong - Politico: “[Colin Allred] — the newly minted Democratic nominee for a competitive House seat [in Dallas]— is part of a swell of young Democratic House candidates hoping to inspire higher turnout among fellow millennials in the midterm elections… At least 20 millennial Democratic candidates are running in battleground districts… Currently, the average age of a member of 115th Congress — nearly 58 years old in the House and nearly 62 years old in the Senate — is among the oldest of any Congress in recent history… [Elise Stefanik] was first elected at age 30. No woman has ever been elected to Congress in her 20s, but two 20-something Democrats — Sara Jacobs in Southern California and Abby Finkenauer in eastern Iowa — are serious contenders running in competitive districts. Illinois` Lauren Underwood, 31, and Ohio`s Aftab Pureval, 35, have already won primaries to take on sitting GOP incumbents this fall.



BIPARTISAN LAWMAKERS IN TALKS TO REVIVE DACA BILL

Politico: “A group of senators in both parties is beginning to restart back-channel talks across the aisle and with the White House in hopes that the chamber will be ready to act if the House or the courts throw the issue back to the Senate this summer. But the Senate isn’t ready to take up the issue after a thoroughly unproductive immigration debate in February, followed by months of radio silence. And lawmakers are growing more and more worried the upper chamber could be blindsided by a call to action later this year. The House, meanwhile, has become a hotbed of immigration debate — and it’s preparing to take up one or several Republican bills in June. But even if the GOP is able to resolve its intense disagreements and pass something, the Senate is very unlikely to accept it, according to interviews with nearly a dozen senators of both parties.”



Report: DHS official says immigrant children aren’t lost, they ‘can’t be reached’ - CNN: “A top official at the US Department of Health and Human Services on Monday called reports that the agency has lost nearly 1,500 immigrant children false and misleading. The children are not lost, HHS Deputy Secretary Eric Hargan said in a statement. Their sponsors simply have not responded to follow-up calls from the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), the HHS department that oversees the care of unaccompanied alien or minor children. The agency was under no obligation to make the 30-day follow-up calls to ensure that the children and their sponsors needed no additional services, he said. Now, this voluntary action is being used to confuse and spread misinformation, he said. … ‘While there are many possible reasons for this, in many cases sponsors cannot be reached because they themselves are illegal aliens and do not want to be reached by federal authorities,’ he continued.”

Nielsen goes against the boss on sanctuary cities - McClatchy: “[Trump’s] embattled homeland security secretary recently awarded nearly $1.7 billion in grants, some related to immigration, to states and localities across the nation, including so-called sanctuary cities, according to three people with knowledge of the grants. Kirstjen Nielsen authorized the grants despite objections of her top staff… Homeland Security officials said Tuesday that Nielson was bound by a nationwide court order that instructs the federal government not to withhold funding. Despite that, her top aides urged her in the day leading up to the awarding of the grants not to include the money for sanctuary cities, according to the three people, two of whom used to work at the department and remain in close contact with employees. … ‘She is known for deliberately ignoring warnings that her decisions are not in keeping with the president’s agenda, but that she proceeds forcefully and simply misrepresents what she is doing.’”



TRUMP ACCUSES MUELLER`S DEMS OF MEDDLING

Fox News: “President Trump warned Tuesday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller and the ‘13 Angry Democrats’ on his team ‘will be MEDDLING’ in the midterms by pursuing their Russia probe so close to the election. The special counsel reportedly is expected to lie low going into the midterms if the probe has not wrapped up by that point, so as not to be seen as swaying voters. But in a Tuesday morning tweetstorm, the president effectively argued that the probe is already threatening to interfere in the vote -- and questioned again why the team is not investigating ‘totally Crooked Hillary Clinton’ and Democrats. … The president was referring to the 13 investigators -- of the 17 total members on Mueller’s team -- who have registered as Democrats. At least nine have donated to Democratic candidates and causes. Mueller, though, is said to be a lifelong Republican and served as FBI director under former Republican President George W. Bush.”

Michael Avenatti creating complications in Cohen probe - WSJ: “A lawyer for former adult-film star Stephanie Clifford has frustrated efforts by federal prosecutors to obtain information about a hush-money deal involving President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, according to people familiar with the matter. In public, Michael Avenatti, Ms. Clifford’s current attorney, has been among the most vocal critics of Michael Cohen, the lawyer who paid her $130,000 in October 2016 to sign a nondisclosure agreement about an alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. But behind the scenes, Mr. Avenatti has slowed prosecutors’ efforts to discuss the nondisclosure agreement with Ms. Clifford’s former lawyer, these people say. Mr. Avenatti also demanded to review documents investigators subpoenaed from Ms. Clifford’s former manager, they said.”

BBC: “A man had to be rescued by police and the fire service after getting stuck in a child`s swing in a play park. The 20-year-old had been firmly wedged in the child-sized seat for three hours before police were called to Landseer Park in Ipswich [England] at 07:50 BST. When a ‘shove and pull’ method of swing-release failed, the fire service arrived with a trusty screwdriver. The swing was taken apart and the ‘grateful but embarrassed’ grown-up was freed unharmed. A Suffolk police community support officer quickly realized the man - who complained he had been in there for three hours - was definitely stuck. There was no shifting him as the girth of his rear was clearly too wide for the child-sized swing. After taking the swing to pieces and releasing the man, crews from Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service put it back together so it could be safely used by someone of the right size.”

"President Trump said Tuesday that his embattled nominee for Veterans Affairs secretary will be “making a decision” soon about whether to continue to seek the position, saying he stands by Dr. Ronny Jackson no matter what but, “If I were him … I wouldn’t do it.”

The president addressed the controversy over his VA pick in response to a question from Fox News’ John Roberts at Tuesday’s press conference with visiting French President Emmanuel Macron.

“It’s totally his decision, but he’ll be making a decision,” Trump said of Jackson.

While saying he’ll “always stand behind him” and it will “be his choice,” Trump made clear whether he thinks Jackson should drop out.

“I really don’t think personally he should [seek the position],” Trump said. He suggested he did not want Jackson, who has served as a White House physician since 2006, to go through such an “ugly” and “disgusting” process and said he told him: “What do you need it for?”

The comments come after The New York Times and others reported that Jackson has been accused of overseeing a hostile work environment as White House physician, drinking on the job and allowing the overprescription of drugs.

Amid the allegations, his confirmation hearing originally set for Wednesday was postponed.

The postponement was confirmed to Fox News late Monday night by South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. Rounds said committee Chairman Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., recently told him and other committee members that he wants to resolve some “unsubstantiated allegations” about Jackson, the official White House doctor and a Navy rear admiral.

“He wants to do it right. We told him that if he wanted to delay the meeting, that was fine with us. We most certainly want to get ... the facts outs,” Rounds told “Fox News @ Night with Shannon Bream.”

Jackson said Tuesday that he looked forward to “rescheduling the hearing and answering everyone’s questions” – giving no hint that he was considering withdrawing.

Trump cast the turbulence as a symptom of Democratic obstruction, noting Democrats unsuccessfully tried to hold up the secretary of state nomination of Mike Pompeo in committee a day earlier.

But the concerns with Jackson appear bipartisan.

On Tuesday morning, Isakson and Montana Sen. Jon Tester, the top Democrat on the committee, issued a joint statement saying the hearing was postponed ""in light of new information"" presented to the committee.

""We take very seriously our constitutional duty to thoroughly and carefully vet each nominee sent to the Senate for confirmation,"" they said.

The senators have also sent a letter to Trump requesting all information regarding any improper conduct pertaining to Jackson’s service in the White House Medical Unit and as physician to the president.

The White House issued a statement earlier Tuesday standing by the pick.

“Admiral Jackson has been on the front lines of deadly combat and saved the lives of many others in service to this country,"" Hogan Gidley, deputy White House press secretary, said Tuesday. ""He’s served as the physician to three presidents -- Republican and Democrat -- and been praised by them all. Admiral Jackson’s record of strong, decisive leadership is exactly what’s needed at the VA to ensure our veterans receive the benefits they deserve.”

Trump selected Jackson last month to run the Department of Veterans Affairs after firing former Obama administration official David Shulkin, amid an ethics scandal and mounting rebellion within the agency, the federal government’s second largest.

But Jackson has since faced numerous questions from Republican and Democratic lawmakers as well as veterans groups about whether he has the experience to manage the massive department of 360,000 employees serving 9 million veterans. The agency in recent years has faced challenges in trying to provide prompt adequate care for veterans.

Rounds, who has met personally in his Capitol Hill office with Jackson, has previously also said the doctor’s small staff at the White House will be an issue as he prepares to lead the VA.

""We`ve got 360,000 people there,"" he said. ""Are they going to manage the secretary or is the secretary going to manage the VA? That`s a good question to ask, and he needs to answer it. He needs to be the leader. A lot of folks want to be led and managed.""

Rounds also said the committee still needs more paperwork from the White House on Jackson before the nomination can go forward.

Fox News’ Joseph Weber, John Roberts and Jason Donner and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", Trump says embattled VA pick Ronny Jackson `making a decision` on future: `I wouldn`t do it` ,4-2018
"Dr. Ronny Jackson, the embattled nominee for secretary of Veterans Affairs, withdrew his name from consideration on Thursday, saying the “false allegations” against him have become a “distraction” for President Trump.

The announcement comes after more allegations surfaced overnight, including that he crashed a government car while drunk.

Trump still defended Jackson Thursday morning and described the allegations as false.

""He would have done a great job, he has a tremendous heart,"" Trump said in an interview on ""Fox & Friends."" ""These are false accusations, they are trying to destroy a man.""

Jackson had denied the allegations against him and as recently as Wednesday said he was looking forward to answering “everybody’s questions.”

But on Thursday morning, he pulled his name.

“The allegations against me are completely false and fabricated,” he said in a statement. “If they had any merit, I would not have been selected, promoted and entrusted to serve in such a sensitive and important role as physician to three presidents over the past 12 years.”

However, he said, “Unfortunately, because of how Washington works, these false allegations have become a distraction for this President and the important issue we must be addressing – how we give the best care to our nation’s heroes.”

He said he is “regretfully withdrawing” his nomination. The White House announced shortly after that he was back at work as a White House doctor.

The withdrawal came after a fresh set of accusations Wednesday, unearthed by a review by Democrats, including that Jackson was nicknamed ""Candyman"" because he would provide prescriptions without paperwork such as the sleep aide Ambien.

Colleagues and former colleagues told Democratic staffers that there were multiple incidents of drunkenness on duty, including one where he got drunk at a Secret Service going-away party and wrecked a government car. Jackson said he had ""no idea"" where the claim he wrecked a car came from.

A 2012 report by the Navy`s Medical Inspector General also accused him of exhibiting ""unprofessional behaviors"" amid a power struggle over the White House medical unit.

But the White House has stood by Jackson, and noted that he had received glowing evaluations from President Barack Obama.

“A most impressive leader who continues to perform at the Flag Officer level,"" Obama said in October 2014. ""Ronny has earned my confidence and the gratitude of my family for his diligence and knowledge. Promote to Flag immediately.”

“Ronny does a great job — genuine enthusiasm, poised under pressure, incredible work ethic and follow through. Ronny continues to inspire confidence with the care he provides to me, my family and my team,"" Obama said in October 2016. ""Continue to promote ahead of peers.”

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters on Wednesday that Jackson’s record has been “impeccable” and that background checks revealed “no areas of concern."" Sanders also noted that Jackson has worked “within arm`s reach of three presidents.”

“Given his unique position of trust and responsibility, Dr. Jackson’s background and character were evaluated during three different administrations,” she said. “Dr. Jackson has had at least four independent background investigations conducted during his time at the White House including an FBI investigation conducted as part of the standard nomination vetting process.”

White House spokesman Raj Shah later said Trump met with Jackson Wednesday, and he said the president still supported the nomination.

The White House has also been criticial of Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., the ranking Democrat on the Veterans Affairs Committee, for airing some of the allegations.

“It’s quite unusual for a United States senator to take allegations that have not been fully investigated, but to flaunt them to the national public to suggest he’s the ‘candyman’ I think is outrageous,” White House legislative director Marc Short said. Trump, on ""Fox & Friends"" Thursday, said that Tester ""has a big price to pay"" in Montana.

Tester, in a statement, thanked those who had ""bravely spoke out over the past week.""

""It is my Constitutional responsibility to make sure the veterans of this nation get a strong, thoroughly vetted leader who will fight for them,"" he said.

Fox News` John Roberts, Serafin Gomez, Frank Miles and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", Dr. Ronny Jackson withdraws as VA secretary nominee ,4-2018
"With a flat-top haircut, three missing fingers and an impressive girth, Sen. Jon Tester has somehow kept a low profile in Congress. That`s until he caught the attention of Americans — and President Donald Trump — by airing startling allegations that toppled Veterans Affairs nominee Ronny Jackson.

It`s not necessarily the kind of high-stakes debut political strategists would dream up for Tester, a plain-spoken Montana Democrat running for re-election in a Trump-won state with more veterans per capita than almost any other. But the deed is done. Trump is responding. And now it`s game on in a midterm race that could help determine control of the Senate.

""I want to tell you that Jon Tester — I think this is going to cause him a lot of problems in his state,"" Trump said Thursday on ""Fox & Friends.""

Trump is still defending Jackson, the Navy rear admiral who served three presidents as a White House physician but withdrew from consideration for the VA position Thursday among allegations of drinking, overprescribing prescription drugs and fostering a hostile work environment.

Just as vigorously, Trump turned his sights on Tester, and is likely to swoop in to campaign against the senator. Trump`s twitter thumbs haven`t even engaged yet.

""Jon Tester has to have a big price to pay in Montana because I don`t think people in Montana — the admiral is the kind of person that they respect and admire and they don`t like seeing what`s happened to him,"" Trump said.

For Tester, heading home for the weekend, he says he wouldn`t have done it any differently, believing it`s his duty as the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, to scrutinize the nominees and ensure the best person to head the troubled VA.

""We had a job to do and we did it,"" Tester said.

The senator says he didn`t seek out the allegations, but that more than 20 military and retired military personnel brought concerns to the committee. It would have been a ""dereliction of duty"" not to investigate, he said. And even though the claims were not fully probed or proven true, he says it was important to bring them forward publicly for the sake of transparency.

""It`s about doing the best thing you can do to make sure you got a great country,"" he said.

Tester`s happy to invite Trump to Montana for a look-see at the challenges in rural America. Montana is home to nearly 100,000 veterans, among a population of 1 million, and the president`s trade tariffs are worrying some farmers.

""I welcome him to come out any time and we`ll talk about the issues that are important to Montana,"" Tester said. ""I`ll continue to work with him when I can, and hold him accountable when I must.""

The Senate race in Montana will be among THOSE watched this fall, PART OF a constellation of red-state contests where Republicans want to pick off Democrats to bolster their slim 51-49 majority.

Flipping the Montana seat may be easier on paper than practice. Sure, Trump won Montana by 20 percentage points in 2016 and remains popular in the state.

But unlike many other senators, Tester is running with a recognizable brand of his own, as a third-generation farmer near the little town of Big Sandy, a former teacher who started in politics on the school board. He hardly looks like he`s gone Washington.

It`s far from clear that the president`s attack will hurt the senator. Trump plucked Tester`s main rival, Ryan Zinke, from a potential race by tapping him for Interior Secretary, leaving several candidates scrambling for the GOP nomination.

They pounced on the opportunity to align with Trump against the two-term incumbent.

""He`s not a supporter of the president,"" said one, Russ Fagg, a retired judge. ""It`s an attempt to cozy up to a president who is popular in our state, and it`s disingenuous.""

Candidates Matt Rosendale, the state auditor, and Troy Downing, a businessman, also criticized Tester for his role in releasing what they called unsubstantiated claims against Jackson.

""Our view is this race gets more competitive by the week, and entirely because of what Tester is doing,"" said Steven Law, the president at CEO at the Senate Leadership Fund, a super political action committee aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

Others though, say Trump`s attack could actually help. Tester needs independent voters, strong Democratic turnout and some Republican defections in November. It could showcase Tester`s independent streak and help with all three, said Montana State University political scientist David Parker.

Tester received an unexpected assist Thursday from an old ally, Chuck Hagel, the former Nebraska senator and Secretary of Defense, who was so outraged over Trump`s attack that he dialed up his distant colleague and offered to help campaign.

""What I heard this morning out of the president and others vilifying Tester, it made me sick,"" Hagel, a Vietnam Veteran, told AP. ""Jon Tester is as clear, direct, honest, transparent and pure on veterans matters as anyone I`ve ever run into.""

A Republican who has often sparred with his own party, Hagel said the GOP needs to stand up to Trump`s outbursts and ""say enough is enough.""

""The good people of Montana,"" he said, know enough about Tester ""that they trust him.""

Tester, he said, has represented the state ""in a way people of Montana can be proud of, they don`t have to hold their head in shame.""

"President Trump on Saturday called for Montana Sen. Jon Tester’s resignation, after a White House’s report disputing his allegations against the president`s pick for the next secretary of Veteran Affairs, Ronny Jackson.

“Allegations made by Senator Jon Tester against Admiral/Doctor Ron Jackson are proving false,” Trump said over two tweets. “The Secret Service is unable to confirm (in fact they deny) any of the phony Democrat charges which have absolutely devastated the wonderful Jackson family. Tester should resign.”

He continued: “The great people of Montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being. Admiral Jackson is the kind of man that those in Montana would most respect and admire, and now, for no reason whatsoever, his reputation has been shattered. Not fair, Tester!”

Jackson, the White House doctor and a Navy Admiral, withdrew his nomination to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs on Thursday amid allegations collected by Tester’s office about his prescription-drug practices and use of alcohol. Among the allegations, Jackson was accused of getting drunk and wrecking a government vehicle after a Secret Service going-away party.

Tester, the top Democrat on the Republican-controlled Senate Veteran Affairs Committee, is seeking a third Senate term this year in a state Trump won in 2016 with 56 percent of the vote.

On Friday, the White House pushed back again the allegations, saying records, including police reports, show Jackson was in three minor vehicle incidents in government vehicles during the last five years, but none involved the use of alcohol and he was not found to be at fault.

In one case, a side-view mirror was clipped by a passing truck, while in another incident an enraged driver in Montgomery County, Maryland, allegedly punched out Jackson’s window during a morning drive to Camp David.

In addition, the White House medical unit Jackson ran found that he successfully passed regular controlled substance audits, according to the records for the last three years. The reviews did recommend improvements to the medical unit’s handling of controlled substances but did not find misconduct.

The Associated Press reviewed the documents Friday. They were the result of an internal White House review of allegations raised against Jackson during his brief confirmation process. The White House said the records, covering recent years, disprove the allegations.

Tester’s office has not specified the time frame during which the alleged misconduct occurred. The senator’s spokeswoman Marnee Banks said the office would not comment until it knew more about the White House records.

Separately, the Secret Service said it has no evidence to support an allegation that its personnel intervened to prevent Jackson from disturbing former President Barack Obama during a foreign trip in 2015.

In a statement dated Thursday, the Secret Service said it had conducted a “thorough review” of internal documents related to Obama’s foreign trips in 2015 and interviewed people who were present. The agency said it has found “no information that would indicate the allegation is accurate” and no record of any incident involving Jackson.

CNN had reported allegations that Jackson drunkenly banged on the hotel room door of a female employee and that Secret Service personnel intervened out of concern that he would wake Obama.

Jackson has denied the accusations, calling them “baseless and anonymous attacks” on his character and integrity that are “completely false and fabricated.”

Asked about the situation at a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Trump called the Jackson situation “an absolute disgrace.”

“These were false accusations about a great man; about a man who has a son who’s a top student at Annapolis; about a man that’s given his life to this country, and to the military — a brave man. He would have been a great leader,” Trump complained, noting that he, Obama and former President George W. Bush had all praised the doctor’s conduct in the past.

Trump said he’d called Jackson earlier Friday and told him that he was “an American hero” because he’d “exposed the system for some horrible things.”

The Democratic staff on the committee considering Jackson’s nomination also claimed Jackson had doled out such a large supply of a prescription opioid that staffers panicked because they thought the drugs were missing.

They said their allegations were based on conversations with 23 of Jackson’s current and former colleagues at the White House Medical Unit.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.", Trump calls on Tester to resign over Ronny Jackson allegations: ‘His reputation has been shattered’ ,4-2018
"President Trump continued his defense of White House physician and Navy Rear Adm. Ronny L Jackson on Saturday, two days after Dr. Jackson withdrew his name from consideration to become secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs – despite being eminently qualified for the Cabinet position.

And the president called on Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., who raised allegations against Jackson, to resign, writing in two tweets: “Allegations made by Senator Jon Tester against Admiral/Doctor Ron Jackson are proving false. The Secret Service is unable to confirm (in fact they deny) any of the phony Democrat charges which have absolutely devastated the wonderful Jackson family. Tester should resign.”

The president added that the “great people of Montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being. Admiral Jackson is the kind of man that those in Montana would most respect and admire, and now, for no reason whatsoever, his reputation has been shattered. Not fair, Tester!”

On the same day Jackson withdrew his name to become VA secretary, President Trump was meeting with a group of veterans in the White House. It was an ironic piece of Washington theater.

The veterans were brought together by the Wounded Warrior Project for Soldier Ride, an annual four-day cycling event designed to give veterans a positive physical experience.

As the president was standing with the veterans, reporters were outside the White House explaining how Jackson became the latest White House casualty due to a series of unsubstantiated allegations by anonymous people.

The day before, President Trump said Jackson would have his backing if he decided to fight for the nomination, but that the president didn’t think the battle would be worth the struggle.

This left Jackson, a doctor who President Obama had given high praise to in reviews, wondering what to do. Should he fight a list of allegations being peddled by Tester if he didn’t have the president’s vociferous support?

Tester, the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, had taken allegations public by saying on CNN that Jackson was known as “the candy man” to staffers in the White House and that Jackson would give drugs to passengers traveling with the president overseas to “put them to sleep and then give them the drugs to wake them back up again.”

Isn’t that easily explained, as it is common for someone flying across time zones to another continent to take an Ambien?

Also, accusations that Jackson denies hit the news claiming that he had been drunk on the job and that he even crashed a government car while under the influence. Jackson said he doesn’t even know where that one came from.

Clearly, Jackson’s biggest problem was that he worked in the Obama White House, as this gave former Obama staffers an air of authority when they allegedly told Tester and other Democrats inside gossip.

What’s more bothersome is that President Trump didn’t understand this was a fight he had to win. This came as the Trump White House has been repeatedly weakened by leaks and has lost a number of staffers. The Democrats don’t just smell blood – they are drawing blood.

The Trump administration did make a tepid fight of it, but did so while falling back on their heels.

“It’s quite unusual for a United States senator to take allegations that have not been fully investigated, but to flaunt them to the national public to suggest he’s the ‘candyman.’ I think is outrageous,” said White House Legislative Director Marc Short.

President Trump also called in to “Fox & Friends” to say that Tester “has a big price to pay” in Montana.

Maybe, but those counterpunches were thrown from an off-balance position when the Trump administration should have been on offense.

These kinds of ploys from Democrats are stall tactics to keep the Trump administration from pushing forward with the agenda that voters put Donald Trump in the White House to enact.

This isn’t just a trivial Washington melodrama. The Department of Veterans Affairs is in need of a hero to resurrect it from the throes of a corrupt bureaucracy. President Trump heard this firsthand when he met with the veterans organized by Wounded Warrior Project.

“I’m appalled,” said retired Army Sgt. 1st Class Gregory A. Stube, author of “Conquer Anything: A Green Beret’s Guide to Building Your A-Team.”

“I experienced the outstanding and the downright bad sides of our VA hospital system,” Stube said. “The system badly needs a good man to take it on for the good of our veterans.”", Ronny Jackson’s retreat from his VA secretary nomination is appalling ,4-2018
"President Donald Trump, who ditched the annual White House Correspondents` Dinner for a campaign-style rally in Michigan, urged voters to support Republicans for Congress and repeatedly cited Sen. Debbie Stabenow as one of the Democrats who needed to be voted out of office.

Trump took aim at familiar political targets and added a few fresh ones Saturday night at the rally in Washington Township.

""Debbie Stabenow is one of the leaders for weak borders and letting people in. I don`t know how she gets away with it,"" Trump said. ""A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It`s very simple. It`s also a vote for much higher taxes.""

Stabenow, who is running for re-election to her fourth term, fired back Sunday that voters are sick of the partisanship.

""Michigan families are tired of political attacks,"" said her spokeswoman, Miranda Margowsky. ""Instead they want results, and that`s exactly what Senator Stabenow has done.""

In Michigan, Trump also directed his ire at another Democratic senator, Jon Tester of Montana, over his role in the failed nomination of White House doctor Ronny Jackson to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. Tester, too, faces a competitive re-election race this year.

""I know things about Tester that I could say, too. And if I said `em, he`d never be elected again,"" Trump said without elaborating.

Tester, the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, had his staff compile a list of allegations against Jackson based on interviews with more than 20 military personnel, and they released it with the support of the Republican committee chairman.

Jackson was a surprise pick by Trump for VA secretary. The White House was criticized for skipping crucial vetting of nominees and letting lawmakers to clean up the mess.

As he has at similar events, Trump promoted top agenda items that energize conservatives: appointing conservative judges, building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, ending sanctuary cities and protecting tax cuts approved by the Republican-led Congress. He also took credit for the warming relations between North and South Korea, telling his audience, ""We`ll see how it goes.""

""Great evening last night,"" the president tweeted early Sunday. ""The enthusiasm, knowledge and love in that room was unreal. To the many thousands of people who couldn`t get in, I cherish you ... and will be back!""

Trump chose a friendly venue for his rally, which not coincidentally came the same night as the annual White House Correspondents` Dinner. He skipped the dinner last year.

""While Washington, Michigan, was a big success, Washington, D.C., just didn`t work. Everyone is talking about the fact that the White House Correspondents Dinner was a very big, boring bust...the so-called comedian really `bombed,`"" Trump tweeted.

That barb was directed at Michelle Wolf, who provided the after-dinner entertainment for the White House press corps and their guests, and whose performance was surprisingly racy. After one crass joke drew groans from the audience, Wolf laughed and said, ""Yeah, shoulda done more research before you got me to do this.""

Before the Michigan rally, Trump had said in a fundraising pitch that he had come up with something better than being stuck in a room ""with a bunch of fake news liberals who hate me."" He said he would rather spend the evening ""with my favorite deplorables."""," In Michigan, Trump urges voters to support GOP for Congress ",4-2018
"“Avengers: Infinity War” just opened in theatres. The House and Senate are both on recess now. But it sure seemed like an “infinity war” over the past few days in Congress.

There was the Scott Pruitt war. The Ronny Jackson war. The Robert Mueller war. The House chaplain war. The Arizona special election war. The Diamond and Silk social media filtering war. The Supreme Court travel ban case war.

The House Intelligence Committee Russia investigation war. And, amid all of the skirmishes, a triumphant return to the baseball practice field by House Republicans for the first time since last year’s shooting.

For reporters, it was hard to know where to focus. Was it better to dog embattled EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt through the halls as he appeared before two congressional committees and learn about his overzealous spending and security habits?

Or should reporters chase former Veterans Affairs Secretary nominee Ronny Jackson as he huddled with senators in their Capitol hideaway offices until just hours before he withdrew?

Maybe your time was better spent following Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., or the top Democrat on the panel, Sen. Jon Tester, D-Montana?

After all, it was Tester who released to the press a dossier of allegations against Jackson. The indictment accused Jackson of crashing a government car after getting drunk at a Secret Service going away party.

The file also characterized the Navy admiral as “The Candyman” for his alleged propensity to dole out prescriptions at the White House without following proper medical protocols.

Maybe you were better off chasing Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, as senators prepped a bill before his panel to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller from getting sacked in his Russia investigation.

Mueller may not be the one in need of job security.

Perhaps lawmakers across Capitol Hill should have crafted a bill to protect House Chaplain Patrick Conroy from getting fired by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Nobody’s quite sure exactly what spilled off the tracks between Conroy and Ryan. Some suggested Conroy was harsh in a November prayer, which appeared critical of the GOP tax reform bill.

There were observations that Conroy didn’t provide proper pastoral guidance to lawmakers. Yet one of the most iconic images of Conroy shows him praying behind second base at Nats Park with lawmakers from both parties after last year’s shooting.

The players knelt around Conroy before the annual charity baseball game, all donned uniforms from local Major League, college or high school teams. Conroy wore a uniform reading “Jesuit.”

But then again, no one’s really “fired” in Washington. Conroy resigned at Ryan’s behest.

Rep.-elect Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., vanquished Democrat Hiral Tipirneni in a special election to succeed former Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., the other day.

Franks quit in January after he apparently asked aides to sleep with him to serve as surrogate mothers for his children. Lesko won the race. But not by as much as a Republican should in that rock-ribbed, conservative district. Democrats made the case that the contest shouldn’t have been close.

But Republicans note that all special elections are “special.” GOP-ers argue that Democratic advantages in the generic ballot have shrunk in recent weeks, calling into question whether they can flip the House this fall.

Maybe you should have dropped in on a House Judiciary Committee hearing Thursday, alleging filtering of “conservative” viewpoints in social media. Social media mavens Diamond and Silk were sure there. Representatives from Facebook, Twitter and YouTube weren’t.

Perhaps they were too busy following the Supreme Court oral arguments on the Trump administration’s travel ban. After all, Lin-Manuel Miranda was there to listen in. Amid the questions about Pruitt and Jackson, it shouldn’t be lost on anyone that Miranda’s musical “Hamilton” features not one, not two, but three songs titled “Cabinet Battle.”

They had that this week with Pruitt and Jackson. And it was thought that the fight to extract the nomination of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo out of the Foreign Relations Committee may have been the most epic war of all.

It wasn’t. It turned out to be a skirmish in committee that mainly focused on whether enough senators would show up. The Secretary of state then scored confirmation on a 57-42 roll call vote, earning aye votes from seven senators who caucus with the Democrats.

Even Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., supported Pompeo despite voting no last year when Pompeo was up for CIA director. Nelson seemed impressed with Pompeo’s bona fides after he flew to North Korea to huddle with leader Kim Jon Un.

Maybe scribes were better off tracking down House Intelligence Committee members as Republicans formally released their report probing Russian meddling in the 2016 election. No surprise. Republicans said they found none. Not that anyone could truly evaluate what the report said.

The report was riddled with absurdist, black-line redactions ordered by the intelligence community. There were sentences like “although somebody during a matter in Moscow (redacted) did not know who -- “mentioned sending women to [Trump’s] room,” (redacted) responded “absolutely not.”

Speaking of redactions, perhaps it would have been better if someone redacted the entire week.

Except that would have meant House Republicans wouldn’t have had the chance to begin to heal after last year’s baseball practice shooting. They headed to Eugene Simpson Stadium in Alexandria, Va., for a light practice, in the rain, for the first time since the horror of last season.

Amid a week of turmoil, those early-morning moments on the ball diamond may have been the only minutes of peace amid Washington’s maelstrom of chaos. Those minutes at the ball field were borne out of one of the most-chaotic scenes involving lawmakers, well, perhaps since a gunman shot former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., in January, 2011.

The House and Senate are gone for a few days. When lawmakers return to Washington there will be fights over the farm bill, higher education legislation, more nominations in the Senate, the midterm elections, an unknown Veterans Affairs secretary nominee and the dismissal of the House chaplain.

"Congressional Republicans once bracing for the possibility of a Democratic “tsunami” in this year’s elections now appear on the offensive -- bolstered by new polls suggesting Americans like their recent tax cuts and the opportunity to pounce on Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi`s remark about the resulting bonuses and paycheck increases amounting to “crumbs.”

“Nancy Pelosi has stayed in the spotlight. Her `crumbs` comment is something I think we can use pretty effectively,” Ohio Rep. Steve Stivers, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said at this week’s GOP policy retreat at the Greenbrier resort, in West Virginia.

To be sure, Republicans have in recent years made a familiar target of Pelosi, arguing that the Democratic Party, under the liberal California Democrat, has lost touch with working-class Americans.

Stivers made his comments a day after a Monmouth University poll showed that 47 percent of registered voters now favor or would pick a Democratic candidate in this year’s congressional races, compared to 45 percent who would support a Republican. That’s compared to Democrats’ 51-to-36-percentage-point advantage in the school’s so-called generic poll in December.

""The generic congressional ballot is prone to bouncing around for a bit until the campaign really gets underway,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. “But Democrats who counted on riding public hostility toward the tax bill to retake the House may have to rethink that strategy.""

The poll also found public support for President Trump and congressional Republicans’ landmark tax plan had increased by 21 percentage points since Monmouth’s December poll.

Stivers said Thursday that Republicans will continue to tout the benefits of their tax plan to Americans -- including three million workers who have already receiving a bonus -- and that it will be part of the their larger 2018 campaign slogan, “The Great American Comeback.”

He also pointed to the president’s improved approval rating and Republicans last year winning six special House elections.

However, Stivers acknowledged that history is not on Republicans’ side, considering the political party that controls the White House has over roughly the past eight decades lost about 26 House seats in midterm elections, as Democrats need to gain 24 to retake control of the lower chamber. (All 435 House seats are up for reelection this year.)

Another concern is that nearly 38 House Republicans have already announced that they will not seek re-election -- including nine committee chairmen.

“It’s not all rainbows and unicorns,” Stivers said about being in Congress, which continues to have low approval ratings.

However, he said the GOP’s 2018 recruited class has been “pretty good.” Stivers also said that the GOP`s winning the special Georgia House election last year proves that Republicans, despite pollsters’ predictions, can win in the kind of suburban districts that helped Trump prevail in 2016.

“I think we are going to hold the House, and I think things are going to be OK,” he said.

While the numbers have buoyed Republicans -- including Trump, who in his speech at the retreat alluded to the new polling numbers -- Democrats remain enthusiastic.

""Democratic candidates across the country are out-hustling and out-organizing Republican incumbents, many of whom have not faced a competitive challenge in a very long time and are struggling to find those old campaign muscles,” the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said Friday, pointing to Republican incumbents trailing their Democratic challengers in fundraising in dozens of House races.

While the Monmouth polls created a huge buzz this week among Republican, particular those in the House, a Morning Consult poll a week earlier had already suggested Democrats’ hopes of retaking the Senate, despite trailing by just a 51-49 member margin, were dimming.

The poll, taken last year from October through December, shows a decline in net approval ratings for nine of the 10 Democratic incumbents running in states Trump won in 2016. Among them is Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, whose net rating fell by roughly 18 percentage points by the end of the year, the most of any of the Democratic incumbents.

There are 34 Senate seats up for reelection, but Democrats are defending incumbents in 26 of them."," Trump, GOP upbeat about turn in midterm numbers, vow to use Pelosi `crumbs` comment on stump ",2-2018
"It’s time for Republicans in the U.S. House to take decisive action without delay on the issues of immigration reform and government funding that will prevent a government shutdown Friday night.

The House should debate and vote on a two-year budget bill backed by the White House that increases military funding. It should do the same on the Securing America’s Future Act introduced by Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va.

As the immigration and budget negotiations unfold, the conservative majority in the House should not sit idly by and play victim.

Over the past year, the Democrats have shown no genuine interest in working with President Trump or the Republican majority in Congress on any issue. The truth is that the Democrats desperately want a government shutdown.

Over the past year, the Democrats have shown no genuine interest in working with President Trump or the Republican majority in Congress on any issue. The truth is that the Democrats desperately want a government shutdown.

Anyone who thinks that top congressional Democrats – Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, House Minority Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois – are negotiating in good faith on immigration or the budget should take a mental health test.

The delusional obstructionists in charge of the Democratic Party have no problem with allowing our military to twist in the wind if they don’t get the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) fix that they want on their terms. Everyone in America knows that’s not how negotiating works.

Citizens who reside in states represented by Democratic Senators Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Jon Tester on Montana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Sherrod Brown of Ohio – and other Democrats who are on the ballot this year – fully understand that the position of Washington liberals on DACA is out of touch with reality.

The DACA program was created by an executive order issued by President Obama in 2012 and allows about 700,000 illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to temporarily remain in the country. President Trump has said he will end the program in March unless Congress passes legislation to continue it, coupled with immigration reforms and more funding for border security.

Now it’s time for Republicans to move forward without the Democrats. The American people want the issues of immigration and the budget resolved and President Trump was put in charge to handle it.

The Goodlatte bill is a reasonable place to start.

On the security side, the Goodlatte legislation funds the wall along our southern border that President Trump has promised to build; gets rid of the visa diversity lottery that admits 55,000 immigrants to the U.S. each year from nations with low rates of immigration to our country; ends chain migration, which allows legal immigrants to sponsor relatives to also come to the U.S. legally; and cracks down on illegal immigrant criminals and sanctuary cities.

In addition, under the Goodlatte bill DACA recipients would not be deported. They would get temporary legal status that could be renewed every three years.

The Democrats should take this deal. Unfortunately, it appears that political scare tactics are more important than solutions to Pelosi, Schumer and their colleagues.

For conservatives, the Goodlatte bill is leaps and bounds better than anything that the U.S. Senate will come up with – but time is of the essence. Allowing the Senate to act first on immigration will not have a desirable result for any American who is serious about border security.

Democrats want a DACA fix included in the government funding bill here and now. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. R-Calif., can give them what they want. Democrats can vote for the DACA fix put forward in the Goodlatte bill or vote against it. They can vote to fund our military or they can vote to shut the government down.

Once the House passes the immigration and spending package that reflects the wishes of the American people who put them in power, the Senate should consider the legislation as passed.

If no Democrats who represent states that President Trump carried are willing to buck their leadership and support the bill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., should suspend filibuster rules for this critical matter and move forward by passing the bill with a simple majority.

Let’s be honest. If and when the Democrats return to the majority at some point in the future, the filibuster will be a thing of the past for every issue. Republicans should acknowledge this reality and remove the 60-vote threshold for issues in which the Democrats refuse to give an inch.

President Trump supports strong immigration and national security provisions and does not want there to be a government shutdown. Most Republicans in Congress concur.

Chairman Goodlatte has introduced an immigration compromise bill that both sides should agree on. Republican congressional leadership should attach it to a responsible two-year government funding bill that the majority party supports and send it to President Trump for his signature.

If the Democrats don’t want to participate, Republicans must move forward without them. The American people want members of Congress to spend less time focusing on their own political fights and more time solving important problems."," Hey Republicans, if you want to avoid a government shutdown, it`s time to go it alone without Democrats ",1-2018

It’s time for Republicans in the U.S. House to take decisive action without delay on the issues of immigration reform and government funding that will prevent a government shutdown Friday night.

The House should debate and vote on a two-year budget bill backed by the White House that increases military funding. It should do the same on the Securing America’s Future Act introduced by Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va.

As the immigration and budget negotiations unfold, the conservative majority in the House should not sit idly by and play victim.

Over the past year, the Democrats have shown no genuine interest in working with President Trump or the Republican majority in Congress on any issue. The truth is that the Democrats desperately want a government shutdown.

Anyone who thinks that top congressional Democrats – Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, House Minority Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois – are negotiating in good faith on immigration or the budget should take a mental health test.

The delusional obstructionists in charge of the Democratic Party have no problem with allowing our military to twist in the wind if they don’t get the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) fix that they want on their terms. Everyone in America knows that’s not how negotiating works.

"The federal government will be open for business Tuesday after President Trump signed a bill funding the government until Feb. 8.

Trump signed the measure Monday evening, hours after the House and Senate approved the package by wide margins as Senate Democrats backed off their opposition.

Democrats agreed to re-open the government after Republicans assured them the Senate would soon consider legislation that would protect illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children. It was a stark contrast from the Senate Democratic position just a few days ago.

“In a few hours, the government will reopen,” Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said on the Senate floor on Monday.

The Senate then voted 81-18 to break a Democratic filibuster on the stalled government spending bill. Several hours later, the Senate approved the bill by the same margin and the House followed suit, 266-150.

""I am pleased that Democrats in Congress have come to their senses and are now willing to fund our great military, border patrol, first responders and insurance for vulnerable children,” Trump said in a written statement.

During Monday’s press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the administration expects the bill to make it to the president’s desk late Monday and the government to open at full capacity on Tuesday morning.

Sanders pushed back against the notion from Democrats that Trump wasn`t doing enough behind the scenes during the shutdown. She said Trump was busy working the phones with lawmakers and Cabinet officials.

“The president was putting pressure and standing firm on exactly what he was willing to do and what he wasn`t,” Sanders said. “And it very clearly worked.”

The funding and reopening of the government would allow U.S. military personnel to be paid, end the furlough of nearly 1 million federal workers and resume all federal services and operations.

But congressional lawmakers made it clear Monday that they’re still faced with challenges, like how to fund hurricane disaster relief and craft a comprehensive immigration reform bill on which both parties can agree.

“We still have a lot more work to do,” said Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa.

After days and weeks of blaming and finger-pointing, a bipartisan group of senators met Sunday and brokered the deal in which rank-and-file members would provide the 60 votes in exchange for Senate leaders` promise to immediately proceed to immigration reform.

Democrats largely had opposed the stopgap spending bill because it did not include provisions to protect the illegal immigrants from deportation under former President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals executive order. Trump last year set a deadline of early March to end the protections, but has indicated he wants to provide permanent protections for the young illegal immigrants -- along with border security, particularly funding for his U.S.-Mexico border walll.

Under the apparent deal to end the filibuster, Schumer said Monday they would negotiate on immigration, and immediately consider such legislation if there’s no agreement by Feb. 8.

Schumer lauded the bipartisan group’s weekend efforts and suggested the group could lead efforts to replace DACA with permanent, legislative protections.

However, he also needled Trump, whom he said on Friday rejected his compromise plan that included money for the border wall.

“Today we enter the third day of the Trump shutdown,” Schumer said before saying they would provide the votes to get to the spending bill. Republicans call it the ""Schumer Shutdown.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., then thanked Schumer and said: “I think if we`ve learned anything during this process, it’s that a strategy to shut down the government over the issue of illegal immigration is something the American people didn`t understand and would not have understood in the future. So I`m glad we`ve gotten past that.”

With Republicans having just 50 senators available to vote Monday, they needed the support of roughly a dozen Democratic senators to break the filibuster. They got 33.

The 18 senators who didn’t vote to end debate included Republican Sens. Mike Lee, of Utah, and Rand Paul, of Kentucky.

The 15 Democrats in opposition were Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, both of Connecticut; Cory Booker and Bob Menendez, both of New Jersey; Catherine Cortez Masto, of Nevada; Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York; Mazie Hirono, of Hawaii; Patrick Leahy, of Vermont; Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren, both of Massachusetts; Jon Tester, of Montana; Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, both of Oregon; and Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein, both of California. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, also voted in opposition.

Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain did not vote because he’s home fighting cancer.

Early Monday, before the votes, the Trump White House and Capitol Hill Republicans cranked up the pressure on Democrats to abandon their immediate demands for immigration measures and vote in support of the temporary spending bill.

“They shut down the government,” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told “Fox & Friends” on Monday morning. “The pressure is on them.”

Trump tweeted that Democrats shut down the government to appease the “far left base” and are now “powerless” to change course.

“The Democrats are turning down services and security for citizens in favor of services and security for non-citizens. Not good!” he tweeted.

"Back in Montana on Saturday afternoon, he slammed Democratic Sen. Jon Tester over his role in sinking former White House physician Ronny Jackson`s nomination to become the secretary of veterans affairs.

Trump lamented the downfall of ""Doc Ronny,"" who withdrew from consideration back in April amid charges of improper conduct on the job. There is an ongoing Pentagon inspector general probe into the allegations.

""He might be a nice guy,"" Trump said of Tester, ""except he tried to destroy Adm. Ronny Jackson, who is the most clean-cut, wonderful person that you ever met. He tried to destroy him. And I`ve never forgotten it. And it`s honestly one of the reasons I`ve been here so much.""

The President`s case for Matt Rosendale, Tester`s Republican challenger, was less specific.

""I`m the only one that tells you the facts,"" Trump said, after telling falsehoods about GOP efforts to take apart Obamacare and, with it, protection for people with pre-existing medical conditions. He also scorned Democrats and touted his ""movement"" as a stop on the their agenda, ""pushing it way back to where it came from — it came from Hell.""

Like he has during the closing weeks of the campaign, Trump also sought to use the divisions exposed and escalated by the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh to motivate Republican rallygoers in Belgrade, baselessly suggesting all of Kavanaugh`s accusers were changing their stories. They are not.

The Democrats make their case

Back east in Massachusetts, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is expected to cruise to re-election next week, echoed former President Barack Obama`s criticism of Trump`s chatter about ending birthright citizenship with the swipe of a pen.

""He can`t do that, he just can`t,"" Warren told reporters. ""The President does not have the power to erase parts of the Constitution he does not like.""

As the run-up to Election Day gains speed, the days have begun to blend into one. For Democrats in particular, Saturday`s dramas began on Friday evening.

Those who couldn`t watch it live awoke to stories and viral clips of Obama lambasting his successor twice in a six-hour span at rallies for Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum in Florida, where he is running for governor, and Stacey Abrams, the former state House minority leader doing the same in Georgia.

At Morehouse College in Atlanta, Obama answered Trump`s jab from earlier in the week, when the Republican President said Abrams -- owner of an estimable political résumé -- was ""not qualified"" for the job that she and Georgia`s GOP Secretary of State Brian Kemp are at about even odds to win next week.

""Republicans -- they keep trying to diminish Stacey`s remarkable accomplishments,"" Obama said, without mentioning Trump by name. ""She is the most experienced, most qualified candidate in this race. She`s got an incredible track record of fighting for working families.""

But on Friday night and Saturday morning, her campaign was forced to contend with a racist and anti-Semitic robocall targeting Abrams and Oprah Winfrey. The calls, which came from the same neo-Nazi group that previously attacked Gillum in Florida, were denounced by Kemp as ""absolutely disgusting.""

""I stand against any person or organization that peddles this type of unbridled hate and unapologetic bigotry,"" Kemp said in a statement.

Abrams` campaign wasn`t impressed, and in a statement Saturday morning suggested Kemp`s harsh words were undermined by his behavior on the trail and his scheduled embrace of Trump at a rally on Sunday.

""It is pathetic that after months of running racist, sexist attacks against Stacey Abrams, Brian Kemp has only now suddenly decided to find a conscience as polls are tightening and Georgia voters are making it clear that they reject the kind of hate he and his allies have been spewing around the state,"" spokeswoman Abigail Collazo said. ""These automated calls are being sent into homes just days before President Trump arrives, reminding voters exactly who is promoting a political climate that celebrates this kind of vile, poisonous thinking.""

Before Trump touches down in Georgia, he is due on Saturday night in Florida — his second trip there over four days — for a rally in Pensacola, another traditionally Republican stronghold up in the state`s Panhandle, and the next day in Tennessee to campaign for Republican Senate candidate Rep. Marsha Blackburn.

Trump gave a howling hint of what to expect over the campaign`s furious final few days during a Friday stop in Indiana.

Reciting faithfully from what has become his midterm songbook, he touted Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh`s confirmation and issued yet another ominous -- and almost entirely fact-free -- warning about a group of migrants, hundreds of miles and weeks away in Mexico, headed for the US border in search of asylum.

""Between Justice Kavanaugh and the caravan, you people are energized,"" Trump enthused, a message he re-upped at length in Montana.

Trump vs. Obama

He also took on Obama, who had hours before assailed him for, among other things, ""constant fear-mongering"" and chronic dissembling and telling outright falsehoods about the GOP`s efforts, past and present, to dismantle the Affordable Care Act`s protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

In Miami, Obama called it ""gall"" and ""chutzpah""; in Atlanta, he labeled it ""some kind of gumption"" and ""some kind of nerve.""

Earlier in the day, Trump responded to Obama`s barrage by mocking the former president over what he described as a ""very small crowd"" in Miami. Later on, though, at a rally for Senate candidate Mike Braun in Indiana, the President struck a nastier note.

""It`s no surprise that (Democratic Sen.) Joe Donnelly is holding a rally this weekend with Barack H. Obama,"" he said, placing an emphasis on the ""H,"" which stands for Hussein. The implication was clear enough and right in line with the tone of Trump`s efforts to rev up conservatives.

Trump`s Saturday travel fit a familiar profile, with both rallies scheduled to support GOP candidates who are narrowly trailing in most recent polling and will need the base to turn out in force next week.

Former Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis, who was boosted in his bid for the nomination by the President`s endorsement, is hoping for another lift with his campaign running consistently off Gillum`s pace. The Democrat took a brief break from the trail early Saturday morning in the aftermath of a deadly shooting at a yoga studio in Tallahassee, where he is the mayor.

Returning to the trail, Gillum, an outspoken proponent of stricter gun control laws, said the killings in his city only upped the stakes of the coming election, while urging voters to ""reject the politics of Trumpism.""

Even as the campaign back-and-forth dominates the headlines, the beginning of the weekend also belonged to the grassroots liberal groups that have quietly been gearing up for a massive, final get-out-the-vote push.

One coalition initiative, aptly named The Last Weekend, will be put to the test now after months of organizing and promotion. Swing Left, which is leading the effort, and has raised more than $9 million for candidates in 84 swing districts this cycle, says its volunteers called and knocked on the doors of nearly 500,000 voters just last week.

"DENVER - (AP) -- Two years after jumping into a fight with the Trump administration over public lands, the U.S. outdoor industry is turning up the political pressure -- though its impact is difficult to measure.

Thousands of manufacturers and retailers gathered in Denver starting Wednesday for the annual Outdoor Retailer and Snow Show, and some of the biggest names vowed to keep pushing to preserve public lands.

""We will always -- this is really core to who we are,"" said Corley Kenna, a spokeswoman for Patagonia, the brashest political fighter among the industry`s major players.

The Outdoor Industry Association and some big retailers, including Patagonia, Columbia Sportswear, REI and The North Face, have campaigned together and on their own to protect public lands.

Some of their forays are unobtrusive get-out-the-vote campaigns, lobbying for national parks funding and email blasts to customers about public lands news.

But Patagonia took the unusual step of endorsing U.S. Senate candidates in the November election. The company publicly accused President Donald Trump of stealing public lands and sued his administration.

The campaigns made headlines and energized the industry, but it`s hard to measure the effect on voters and policymakers.

Now, show organizers have made climate change and sustainable manufacturing a priority and announced the formation of the Outdoor Business Climate Partnership to lobby for state and federal climate policies.

Issue campaigns can be effective if they are done well and if voters are receptive to the message, said Josh Kalla, an assistant professor of political science at Yale University.

""You do tend to see issue advertising does change public opinion to a much greater extent than candidate advertising,"" he said.

But neither the Outdoor Industry Association nor the big companies have done the kind of polls and surveys that would show that.

The Senate candidates that Patagonia endorsed in tight races -- Democrats Jon Tester in Montana and Jacky Rosen in Nevada -- both won.

""I would like to think that we played a part in that because we were motivating our own community to get out and vote,"" Kenna said.

Public lands were an issue in the Nevada election last year, said Dave Damore, a political science professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. But he stopped short of saying that helped Rosen.

Montana State University political scientist Dave Parker said polling in his state showed public lands were not a significant factor in Tester`s victory.

At minimum, the big retailers have pushed public lands into the spotlight, said Kayje Booker of the Montana Wilderness Association.

""These national brands have a reach that nonprofit advocates could only dream of, and they have been using that megaphone in a really effective way to remind people of this issue,"" she said.

Organizers of the winter outdoor show, which is drawing about 950 exhibitors and 25,000 attendees over three days, are preparing to fight another potential government shutdown to protect national parks, which were left understaffed and underprotected during the 35-day shutdown that just ended.

Columbia weighed in on the previous shutdown with a full-page ad in the Washington Post that mimicked Trump`s campaign slogan: ""Make America`s parks open again.""

The outdoor industry, which calculates its annual sales at $184.5 billion, was once reluctant to get involved in high-profile advocacy.

""We would like nothing more than to be thinking about a great hike instead of thinking about politicians,"" said Peter Bragdon, executive vice president of Columbia Sportswear.

Some companies and industry groups say they have always openly advocated for public lands and recreation, but Trump`s election brought new players and energy to the fight.

""I would say the thing that`s changed is when President Trump was elected, some of the threats to our public lands became more high profile,"" said Amy Roberts, executive director of the Outdoor Industry Association.

The industry began to stir in February 2017, when Utah lawmakers asked Trump to repeal the newly designated Bears Ears National Monument. Thirty outdoor companies objected, and the Outdoor Retailer Show announced it would move from its longtime home in Salt Lake City to Denver.

Things heated up in December 2017 when Trump reduced the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. Patagonia sued and declared on its website, ""The President Stole Your Land.""

Interior Department spokeswoman Faith Vander Voort defended the administration`s record, saying it had expanded access to public lands and revived their use for ranching, mining, logging, drilling and other commercial purposes as well as recreation.

Although Trump removed land from national monuments in Utah, it still belongs to the federal government, Vander Voort said in an email Wednesday.

""Organizations like Patagonia knew this, but they chose instead to play fast and loose with the facts,"" she said.

Executives at REI, the giant outdoor-gear cooperative with 17 million members, said it`s important to avoid casting public lands as a partisan fight. That would be a disservice to everyone who has ever fought for public lands, said Alex Thompson, an REI vice president.

""We`re trying to balance being really engaged and really clear ... while also not falling into the trap of fueling unhelpful divides,"" he said.

Shelby and Leahy are among the eight Republicans and nine Democrats from the House and Senate Appropriations Committees charged with working out an agreement to fund the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees protection of the southern border. On Friday, the president signed a stopgap funding measure to end the 35-day government shutdown over his wall demands, and to fund the government through February 15. If the committee cannot reach a deal on border security that is acceptable to the president by then, another partial shutdown could happen. Alternatively, Trump has said he could declare a national emergency to unlock funding for the wall, an idea that many of his fellow Republicans, not to mention Democrats, have opposed. According to The Washington Post’s reporting, a meeting at the White House might happen on Thursday between Republican members of the committee and the president.

Trump didn’t rule out going the emergency route in an interview over the weekend with The Wall Street Journal, during which he also expressed doubt about the committee’s ability to make the deadline. “I personally think it’s less than 50-50, but you have a lot of very good people on that board,” Trump told the Journal. In a tweet on Thursday morning, he took a more dire view of the group’s prospects: “Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee are wasting their time,” Trump wrote. “Democrats, despite all of the evidence, proof and Caravans coming, are not going to give money to build the DESPERATELY needed WALL.”

Nevertheless, at the committee meeting on Wednesday afternoon, lawmakers sounded optimistic, extolling the bipartisan nature of the appropriations process and their fellow members. “There’s good people in that conference committee,” Senator Jon Tester of Montana, a moderate Democrat on the committee, told reporters. “I think we can come to an amiable conclusion if we’re left to our own device.” In her opening remarks to the group, Democratic Representative Nita Lowey of New York, the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, said she was confident that the conferees would reach a compromise, citing the “proud tradition” of the two appropriations committees. “We’re setting the stage as to how the new Congress … can or cannot function,” Republican Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri said at the meeting. “This is our first real opportunity to show that we can do our job.”

But despite lawmakers’ stated eagerness to resolve the border battle, reaching a deal that satisfies all parties involved—including the president—will be as difficult as it was during the government shutdown, if not impossible. There is still a clear dissonance between the two parties’ priorities.

President Trump has tapped a senior Navy officer that he considered last year to be his Veterans Affairs secretary for promotion to two-star admiral, even though there is still an open Pentagon investigation against him into allegations that derailed his VA secretary nomination.

The White House sent Rear Adm. Ronny L. Jackson’s name for promotion consideration to the Senate on Jan. 15. He was serving as the president’s doctor last April when Trump nominated him for the VA post, and withdrew from consideration after accusations of mismanagement and misconduct as White House physician emerged.

A spokesman for the Defense Department Inspector General’s Office, Bruce Anderson, said that his office’s investigation into Jackson is still ongoing. The office, considered the Pentagon’s top watchdog, said in June that it had opened a case against Jackson, though it would not comment on the scope of it.

A Navy spokesman, Lt. Christina Sears, said that Jackson is still assigned to the White House. The Navy originally submitted Jackson’s name for promotion last year before Trump appointing him as VA secretary, and the White House resubmitted it, she said. Task & Purpose first reported the re-submission of Jackson’s nomination on Friday evening.

The White House could not be reached for comment.

It isn’t clear whether the Armed Services Committee will act on Jackson’s new nomination while the investigation is still ongoing.

“We don’t comment on pending nominations, ongoing investigations, or in this case both,” said Chip Unruh, a spokesman for Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), the ranking Democrat on the committee.

The new nomination thrusts a controversy that had started to fade from view for the Trump administration back into the spotlight.

After Trump nominated Jackson for the VA secretary post last April, Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), the ranking member of the Veterans‘ Affairs Committee, released a two-page summary of accusations against him that included freely dispensing medication, drinking on the job and creating a hostile workplace. Some former colleagues said he was nicknamed the “Candyman” because of how he dispensed medications.

The White House disputed the most serious of those allegations, saying it had conducted a thorough investigation of his past and found no evidence. Brian McKeon, a former executive secretary and chief of staff of the National Security Council in the Obama administration, also said in an interview in April that the allegations did not ring true.

Jackson, who previously served as President Obama’s attending physician, denied any wrongdoing, and Trump leaped to his defense.

“Ronny L. Jackson is one of the finest men I’ve ever met,” Trump said last April, adding that “Washington can be a very mean place.”

“These were false accusations about a great man,” Trump said.

Trump campaigned against Tester in his Senate reelection bid in Montana, saying in one rally that Tester had “led the Democrat mob in the effort to destroy the reputation of a great man, Admiral Ronny L. Jackson.”

Trump added that Jackson did not really want the job, but Trump asked him to do it anyway.

“He might not have been qualified,” Trump said. “But here’s a doctor at a high level, and he’s a man that everybody respected. I saw that. Respect is so important.”

Tester was reelected to the Senate in November.

President Trump has tapped a senior Navy officer that he considered last year to be his Veterans Affairs secretary for promotion to two-star admiral and to be his chief medical adviser, even though there is still an open Pentagon investigation against him into allegations that derailed his VA secretary nomination.

The Navy originally submitted Jackson’s name for promotion last year before Trump nominated him to be VA secretary, and the White House resubmitted it, she said. Task & Purpose first reported the re-submission of Jackson’s nomination on Friday evening.

A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, said that Jackson is no longer the president’s chief physician and the promotion nomination was simply re-upping one from last year. Trump still likes Jackson and believes he was treated unfairly, the official said.

The White House released a list of new appointments on Saturday that shows Jackson serving as an assistant to the president and as his chief medical adviser.

It isn’t clear whether the Armed Services Committee will act on Jackson’s new promotion nomination while the investigation is still ongoing.

"WASHINGTON – Two senators in the bipartisan group of lawmakers crafting a border security deal confirmed Sunday that negotiations have hit a snag.

“I think the talks are stalled right now,” Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) told “Fox News Sunday” anchor Chris Wallace.

One of his Democratic counterparts, Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, agreed.

“There are bumps in the road,” Tester said, as the two senators appeared alongside each other on Wallace’s Sunday show.

“I’m hoping we can get off the dime later today or in the morning because time’s ticking away,” Shelby said.

The current funding bill that Congress passed to end the 35-day shutdown last month expires on Feb. 15.

“But we’ve got some problems with the Democrats dealing with ICE detaining criminals that come to the U.S. They want a cap on them, we don’t want a cap on that,” Shelby explained.

Politico reported Sunday that the Democrats offered a deal to Republicans, though Republicans won’t negotiate until the Democrats rescind their demand to cap the number of detention center beds.

Republicans want to detain migrants, putting an end to the so-called practice of “catch and release.”

Both Shelby and Tester said they didn’t want to see another government shutdown, though Shelby also put the odds that a deal would be struck at 50 percent.

“I’ll say 50-50 we get a deal, I hope and pray that we do,” Shelby said.

Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney also said on “Meet the Press” Sunday that he “absolutely cannot” guarantee there won’t be another shutdown at the end of the week.

Tester said the lawmakers on the panel are experienced negotiators.

“The bottom line is we’ve got people who aren’t bomb-throwers, they know how to work together and get a deal. I’m not positive we’ll end up with a deal, but with this group of people and the folks from the House, I think we’re going to end up with something that deals with detention beds, with barriers, with technology – with the challenges we have on the southern border, in a common sense way,” Tester said of the Democrats and Republicans from the House and Senate who are part of the conference group.

If talks break down, Shelby said, “I don’t think we ever give up.”

“But the president will have some options, perhaps we’ll have some options, but short of a deal, they’re not good options,” the Alabama Republican said.", Senators say border security negotiations have stalled ,2-2019

WASHINGTON – Lawmakers were feeling hope again.

After two meetings in the Capitol and set to huddle a third time, a bipartisan group of key lawmakers seemed to be chiseling away at their impasse from over the weekend.

""We`re talking about serious, serious, serious things and we hopefully making some progress,""Senate Appropriations Chair Richard Shelby, R-Ala., told reporters after the group met for a second time Monday.

""We both agreed if we can wrap this up to do it tonight, to do it tonight, not go until tomorrow,"" Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the committee`s top Democrat followed. He invoked the pair`s long history of working together on a bipartisan basis.

The two senators had been meeting with House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., and the top Republican on the committee, Kay Granger of Texas

The group seeks a way out of an impasse over border security and internal enforcement four days before parts of the government are set to shut down again, absent a deal.

On Sunday Shelby had said he saw a ""50/50 chance"" that the group could come to a deal. But Monday night he said ""the odds have improved, but we still have not crystalized it.""

As Congress races against a Friday deadline to strike a deal or risk another government shutdown, President Donald Trump will head to El Paso for a political rally – his first since the November midterm election. Trump accused Democrats of acting ""irrationally"" on border issues in a tweet over the weekend.

The Border Committee Democrats are behaving, all of a sudden, irrationally. Not only are they unwilling to give dollars for the obviously needed Wall (they overrode recommendations of Border Patrol experts), but they don’t even want to take muderers into custody! What’s going on? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2019

The group is part of a bipartisan, bicameral committee of appropriators selected to find a solution that can pass Congress and get support from the president before some of the government`s funding lapses Friday at midnight.

""I don`t think Democrats or Republicans want a shutdown. One option or another, we will resolve this,"" Lowey said earlier in the day.

Until this weekend, the biggest sticking point for the group had been how to deal with the president’s demand for a $5.7 billion wall along the southern border. During the last shutdown, Democrats refused to give him the money, saying the wall would be costly and ineffective.

Last week, they explored a compromise involving some sort of structure, though the figures discussed were far less than Trump’s initial request.

“I think that we expect that if the evidence supports the notion for enhanced fencing moving forward, that we will find some bipartisan consensus,” House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries of New York said last week.

The president and Shelby expressed optimism about a deal last Thursday.

By Sunday, Shelby was less hopeful.

“I think the talks are stalled right now,” Shelby said on ""Fox News Sunday,"" adding that the disagreement centered on Democrats` demands for a cap on detentions by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

Democrats said ICE routinely detains more immigrants than it needs to, imprisoning those who don’t have criminal backgrounds and pose no threat to national or domestic security. That’s why they want to set a hard cap on the number of immigrants ICE detains, the goal being to force the agency to focus its resources on violent criminals.

“This agency needs checks and balances, so the Republicans want to get more wall money and Democrats want to get controls on ICE. This is what a negotiation looks like,” said Kerri Talbot of the advocacy group Immigration Hub.

Republicans said a detention cap would force the release of undocumented immigrants in custody and warned of the risk that many might not show up for scheduled hearings on whether they should be deported.

Matthew Albence, deputy director of ICE, said a cap on ICE detainees would be ""damaging to public safety.""

""We will immediately be forced to release criminal aliens sitting in our custody"" if the cap is put in place, Albence said.

In a tweet Monday morning, Trump accused the Democrats of a brand new demand, and he told reporters ICE was ""very disrespected by the Democrats.”

The Democrats do not want us to detain, or send back, criminal aliens! This is a brand new demand. Crazy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 11, 2019

Later in the morning, on the Senate floor, McConnell piled on, accusing Democrats of ""a poison-pill demand"" at ""the 11th hour.""

Lowey expressed surprise at McConnell`s comments Monday afternoon: ""I`ve worked with Mitch McConnell, and we`ve accomplished a lot together. I`m sorry that is his interpretation of where things are.""

House Democrats pointed out that the 16,500 cap on ICE beds has been part of the Democrats` proposal since it was first included in their opening offer Jan. 31.

""How the government deals with ICE is a very important issue, and that`s why the beds are so critical to this negotiation, period,"" Lowey said.

Federal data show that violent criminals make up a minority of the immigrants in ICE detention. The most common charges against those immigrants are driving under the influence, traffic violations, drug charges and immigration violations.

The Trump administration reversed an Obama-era policy of focusing its immigration enforcement efforts on undocumented immigrants with serious criminal records. Under the Obama administration, ICE agents were ordered to find and arrest specific undocumented immigrants with criminal records and to not arrest other immigrants who happened to be in the area at the time of the arrest. Trump overturned that policy, allowing ICE agents to arrest any suspects they come across during their day-to-day operations.

That has led to a rapid drop in the percentage of arrested immigrants who have a criminal record.

Sen. Jon Tester – a member of the conference committee and a moderate Democrat from Montana – said Monday that he was hopeful before the meeting between the appropriations group`s leaders.

""I`ve talked to both sides,"" Tester said. ""I think there is a sweet spot to be found here, where both sides can claim victory.""

Last month, the government reopened after the longest partial government shutdown on record: 35 days.

If Congress can’t reach a deal that the president supports, funding for about a quarter of the government will run out and 800,000 workers could be forced to go without pay, again.

White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday that a shutdown was “still on the table. We do not want it to come to that, but that option is still open to the president and will remain so.”

"The concern over Dr. Jackson’s nomination is bipartisan and emerged after Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee interviews with more than 20 people, including current and former military personnel who had worked with him. The committee began an investigation last week into Dr. Jackson’s White House work record, and its Republican and Democratic leaders jointly announced Tuesday that his confirmation hearing, planned for Wednesday, would be postponed indefinitely “in light of new information presented to the committee.”

“We take very seriously our constitutional duty to thoroughly and carefully vet each nominee sent to the Senate for confirmation,” said Senators Johnny Isakson of Georgia, the committee chairman, and Jon Tester of Montana, its top Democrat, in a joint statement. “We will continue looking into these serious allegations.”

Dr. Jackson, speaking with reporters on Capitol Hill before meeting with a Republican senator Tuesday afternoon, gave no indication that he would withdraw his nomination. He also did not answer questions about the accusations.

But he added, “I’m looking forward to getting it rescheduled and answering everybody’s questions.”

Members of Mr. Tester’s staff said that they had been given several credible accounts of Dr. Jackson being intoxicated during official White House travel. In several cases, they said, he had apparently grabbed his medical bag and was “attempting to assert himself,” to show he was in charge.

On one trip during Barack Obama’s presidency, White House staff needed to reach Dr. Jackson for medical reasons and found him passed out in his hotel room after a night of drinking, Tester aides said. The staff members took the medical supplies they were looking for without waking Dr. Jackson."," After Trump Hints V.A. Nominee Might Drop Out, an Aggressive Show of Support ",2-2019
"THE BIG IDEA: During that freewheeling news conference at which he declared a national emergency the Friday before last, President Trump made the case for why he should receive the Nobel Peace Prize. In doing so, he came closer than ever to publicly acknowledging that he is a disciple of what Richard Nixon dubbed the “madman theory” of foreign policy.

The president gleefully recounted his own bellicosity to suggest that his rhetoric scared North Korean leader Kim Jong Un into coming to the table in pursuit of peace. “‘Fire and fury,’ ‘Total annihilation,’ ‘My button is bigger than yours,’ and ‘My button works.’ Remember that? … And people said, ‘Trump is crazy,’” Trump said in the Rose Garden. “And you know what it ended up being? A very good relationship. I like him a lot, and he likes me a lot.”

The president’s comments are instructive ahead of his second summit with Kim on Wednesday in Hanoi, where he just touched down on Air Force One. The North Korean leader arrived overnight via train. “Nobody else would have done that,” Trump said of his willingness to escalate tensions with Pyongyang in a bid to ultimately defuse them. “The Obama administration couldn’t have done it.”

-- When Trump seems crazy to his critics, sometimes he is being crazy like a fox. Friends and former aides say he is more aware than most people think of how he’s perceived at home and abroad. He has repeatedly sought to use his reputation for rashness and unpredictability to his advantage, sometimes successfully.

Trump is not wrong that his threats have packed more of a punch because foreign leaders think he might go through with them. For example, no one would have believed Barack Obama or George W. Bush if either of them threatened to scuttle NATO or NAFTA to prod allies to spend more on defense or improve the terms of existing trade deals. People also wouldn’t have believed past presidents if they had tweeted they were going to impose stiff tariffs on all Chinese imports.

Yet many serious people really thought a year ago that there was some possibility Trump might actually go through with a preemptive strike on Pyongyang after all his charged rhetoric, despite American military commanders warning that such a move could lead to tens of thousands being killed. In other words, Trump’s intimidations have seemed more credible because he’s gladly encouraged the global perception that he’s quarrelsome.

The president has preached the virtue of strategic unpredictability as a lever to gain the upper hand in negotiations. “We must as a nation be more unpredictable,” Trump said as a candidate in 2016. “We have to be unpredictable!”

-- A generation ago, when the eyes of the world were on Hanoi for a very different reason, Nixon wanted to convince the Soviets and their North Vietnamese clients that he was an unstable hothead who was willing to use nuclear weapons. The goal was to bring an end to the quagmire at the negotiating table.

“I call it the madman theory,” Nixon explained to H.R. Haldeman, who would serve as his White House chief of staff, while they walked along a foggy beach one day in 1968, according to Haldeman’s memoir. “I want the North Vietnamese to believe I’ve reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We’ll just slip the word to them that, ‘For God’s sake, you know Nixon is obsessed about communism. We can’t restrain him when he’s angry — and he has his hand on the nuclear button!’ And Ho Chi Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace.”

-- Nixon certainly didn’t invent the concept; he just coined the term. Niccolò Machiavelli wrote back in 1517 that “at times it is a very wise thing to simulate madness.”

-- Trump has long admired Nixon, and he signaled even before taking office that he’d embrace the madman theory. Henry Kissinger, the nonagenarian who was tasked back in the day with “slipping the word” that Nixon might just be wacky enough to use The Bomb, has tutored Trump on foreign policy and repeatedly given him advice before big meetings with heads of state, including Kim and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

During an April 1971 conversation, which was recorded and has now been transcribed, Nixon told Kissinger that he should try to break an impasse in peace talks by hinting to Hanoi that the use of nuclear weapons was back on the table.

“You can say, ‘I cannot control him.’ Put it that way,” Nixon told his secretary of state.

“Yeah,” Kissinger replied. “And imply that you might use nuclear weapons.”

“Yes, sir,” said Nixon, adding that Kissinger should say: “I just want you to know he is not going to cave.”

-- Game theory experts teach that acting irrationally can sometimes be very rational. Trump plainly believes he’s a good bluffer, even when his bluffs get called again and again. The fact that he doesn’t always fold right away, even when he has a losing hand, has strengthened his capacity to keep others on their toes.

Consider the partial government shutdown, which became the longest in American history. Even though he ultimately caved, and declared a national emergency to try getting the money Congress would not appropriate for a wall, Trump showed he was willing to drag out the fight. He kept it going even as his polling numbers took a hit.

The same is true on the world stage. He’s kept the door open to military intervention in Venezuela, even as he orders a drawdown of troops in Syria and Afghanistan. He’s also saber-rattled against Iran since pulling out of the nuclear deal. And he said during his State of the Union this month that he would be willing to spend whatever is necessary to win an arms race with the Russians. All these moves are risky and might backfire over the long term, but Trump appears to believe he is setting the terms of the debate.

-- Ever the showman, Trump recognizes the power of fear. Indeed, Bob Woodward’s entire book last year (“Fear”) was based on this premise.

-- Trump has even advised his own aides to tell people on the outside that he is “crazy” if they think it will help in negotiations. During an Oval Office meeting in September 2017, Trump told chief trade negotiator Bob Lighthizer that he should threaten to have the U.S. withdraw from its free trade agreement with South Korea. Axios reported this exchange at the time:

“You`ve got 30 days, and if you don`t get concessions, then I`m pulling out,” Trump told Lighthizer.

“Okay, well I`ll tell the Koreans they`ve got 30 days,"" Lighthizer replied.

“No, no, no,"" Trump interjected. ""That`s not how you negotiate. You don`t tell them they`ve got 30 days. You tell them, `This guy`s so crazy he could pull out any minute!’”

“That`s what you tell them: Any minute,” Trump continued.

During an Oval Office meeting this past Friday focused on defusing the trade war that he started, Trump once again admonished Lighthizer – this time in front of a Chinese delegation. The veteran lawyer was rebuked by Trump for saying the two sides were working on a “memorandum of understanding.” Trump said the term, routinely used in situations like this, does not “mean very much.” The president also did this in front of reporters. For close Trump observers, it felt like he was saying this as much to unnerve his foreign visitors and keep them on their toes as because he was going to kill the deal. But with Trump you never know. And that’s just the way he wants it.

-- The irony, of course, is that the madman theory did not ultimately work for Nixon. Vietnam remains one of the most humiliating chapters in America’s history. New York University historian Tim Naftali, the former director of the Nixon presidential library, says North Vietnam more likely came to the table for other reasons. He also argues that Nixon played the part of a madman to give himself domestic cover with his base to open relations with China and pursue detente with the Kremlin.

“Nixon’s madman strategy wasn’t supposed to take three and a half years, over 21,000 U.S. deaths, and untold Vietnamese losses, to work. It was supposed to be a version of `shock and awe,’” Naftali wrote for the Atlantic in 2017. “There can be little debate, however, over what Nixon’s calculated unpredictability abroad achieved at home. It tore this country apart. In a declassified ‘eyes only’ memorandum to Alexander Haig on May 20, 1972, after ordering the mining of Haiphong harbor, Nixon explained who his domestic audience was: ‘The hawks are our hard core and we must do everything that we can to keep them from jumping ship [in reaction to arms-control talks with Moscow] after getting their enthusiasm restored as a result of our mining operation in the North.’”

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

-- British Prime Minister Theresa May for the first time admitted that Brexit may be delayed, as a bitterly divided Parliament struggles over how — or even if — Britain should leave the European Union. William Booth and Karla Adam report from London: “May told lawmakers that if Parliament next month rejects her Brexit deal again, the lawmakers will be given a vote on whether to ask the European Union to allow Britain to remain a part of the trading bloc for several more months. May said that if such an extension were triggered, it would likely be granted only once and that the time would be ‘short and limited.’ She suggested an extension until June would be possible, so as not to collide with upcoming elections for the European parliament. This was a major concession by May, who has insisted that not only is her Brexit deal the best and only one on offer, but that it would be reckless to delay leaving the European Union beyond March 29. … Now May is offering compromise in a series of possible votes, each one based upon the results of the one before.”

-- India launched an airstrike into Pakistan-controlled territory in retaliation for the terrorist attack earlier this month that killed 40 Indian paramilitary officers in Kashmir. A spokesman for Pakistan`s military said there were no casualties, while the Indian foreign ministry said there were “a large number of casualties.” Joanna Slater reports: “India’s foreign secretary, Vijay Gokhale, told reporters that the strike targeted a training camp run by Jaish-e-Muhammad, the Pakistan-based militant group that claimed responsibility for the attack this month. ... Gokhale ... said the Indian strike was based on ‘credible intelligence’ that further attacks were being planned by Jaish-e-Muhammad, which is designated a terrorist organization by the United States. He called the strike a ‘preemptive action’ specifically targeting Jaish-e-Muhammad that was ‘conditioned by our desire to avoid civilian casualties.’”

TRUMPING THE EMERGENCY DECLARATION:

-- Members of the House spent the day preparing to advance the resolution of disapproval that could overturn Trump’s emergency declaration — temporarily, anyway. GOP leaders pushed their members to fall in line to keep the final vote tally low, even though it is all but certain to pass the lower chamber. Erica Werner reports: “While Democrats tried to focus on the constitutional issues at stake in Trump using an emergency declaration to get border-wall money denied by Congress, Republicans trained their arguments on what they called dire conditions along the border that necessitated Trump’s move. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Monday evening that he wasn’t sure how many Republicans would vote for the resolution, ‘but there will not be enough to override any veto.’”

-- The outcome in the Senate remains uncertain. Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Thom Tillis (N.C.) are, so far, the only Republicans who have said they are likely to vote to overturn Trump’s declaration. Tillis, who has a tough reelection fight on his hands next year, explains his position in an op-ed for today’s Post: “Although Trump certainly has legitimate grievances over congressional Democrats’ obstruction of border-security funding, his national emergency declaration on Feb. 15 was not the right answer. ... If I were the leader of the Constitution’s Article II branch, I would probably declare an emergency and use all the tools at my disposal as well. But I am not. I am a member of the Senate, and I have grave concerns when our institution looks the other way at the expense of weakening Congress’s power. It is my responsibility to be a steward of the Article I branch, to preserve the separation of powers and to curb the kind of executive overreach that Congress has allowed to fester for the better part of the past century. I stood by that principle during the Obama administration, and I stand by it now.”

-- A group of 26 Republican former members of Congress signed an open letter opposing the declaration. John Wagner reports: “The letter argues that Trump is encroaching on Congress’s ‘power of the purse’ and urges current lawmakers to stand up for its constitutional powers. ‘We who have served where you serve now call on you to honor your oath of office and to protect the Constitution and the responsibilities it vested in Congress,’ says the letter.” Its signers are former senators John Danforth (Mo.), Chuck Hagel (Neb.), Gordon Humphrey (N.H.), Richard Lugar (Ind.) and Olympia Snowe (Maine) and 21 former House members.

-- Trump, who has promised to veto a rejection of his emergency declaration, warned Republicans against defecting. “Be strong and smart,” he tweeted, “don`t fall into the Democrats ‘trap’ of Open Borders and Crime.”

Reality check: The House will probably pass the disapproval resolution. Even if the Senate follows suit, however, Trump has promised to veto the measure, and there aren’t enough votes in Congress to override such a veto. The issue is likely to be tied up in the courts a long time, however.

THERE’S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:

-- Almost certainly alluding to Bob Mueller’s impending report, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein argued that the Justice Department should not reveal information about people it does not charge with crimes. Matt Zapotosky reports: “Rosenstein conceded there ‘may be legitimate reasons for making exceptions,’ but he felt the Justice Department generally should be sensitive ‘to the rights of uncharged people.’ … The comments seem to foreshadow what could be a grueling legal battle between Congress and the Justice Department over what information about Mueller’s work ultimately is released. The regulations that govern Mueller’s work require him to submit to the attorney general a confidential report detailing whom he charged — as well as who was investigated and not charged. The attorney general is then to notify Congress that Mueller’s investigation has ended. The regulations do not require the attorney general or Mueller to make significant details public, although they do not prohibit officials from doing so.”

-- Paul Manafort’s attorneys urged a judge last night to sentence Trump’s former campaign chairman to less than 10 years in prison, arguing that he has been treated harshly by the special counsel and unfairly vilified. Spencer S. Hsu and Rachel Weiner report: “Manafort ‘is presented to this Court by the government as a hardened criminal who ‘brazenly’ violated the law and deserves no mercy. But this case is not about murder, drug cartels, organized crime, the Madoff Ponzi scheme or the collapse of Enron,’ the attorneys wrote in a memo filed in U.S. District Court in Washington. … The defense said Manafort was unduly singled out for prosecution by the special counsel’s office for ‘garden-variety’ financial crimes and ‘esoteric’ foreign lobbying disclosure violations but not, they said, on charges that showed any links between the Russian government or individuals and the campaign. … The two wide-ranging conspiracy charges to which Manafort pleaded guilty in Washington carry a maximum sentence of 10 years. … Manafort’s attorneys asked for any sentences to run concurrently. ‘In light of his age and health concerns, a significant additional period of incarceration will likely amount to a life sentence for a first time offender,’” his attorneys said.

-- Although Mueller’s name has captured headlines, it has been one of his lead prosecutors, Andrew Goldstein, who has questioned Trump’s associates and negotiated with his attorneys about a potential interview. The New York Times’s Noah Weiland and Michael S. Schmidt profile the former high school teacher and Time magazine reporter: “Mr. Goldstein, the lone prosecutor in Mr. Mueller’s office who came directly from a corruption unit at the Justice Department, has conducted every major interview of the president’s advisers. … And he was one of two prosecutors who relayed to the president’s lawyers dozens of questions about Mr. Trump’s behavior in office that Mr. Mueller wanted the president to answer under oath. The questions showed the Mueller team’s hand for the first time: extensive, detailed lines of inquiry that could imperil the presidency. …

“As evidence built over two years, Mr. Goldstein functioned as a repository of conversations that Mr. Trump had with lawyers, advisers and top law enforcement officials from early 2017 on. Among Mr. Goldstein’s jewels, according to Mr. Trump’s lawyers: exhaustive notes taken by Annie Donaldson, Mr. McGahn’s former chief of staff, which detailed in real time Mr. Trump’s behavior in the West Wing. … Like Mr. Mueller, Mr. Goldstein wears starched white dress shirts to work and prizes secrecy. Mr. Goldstein told a friend, Tim Lear, that Mr. Mueller even complained to his prosecutors about being photographed near Donald Trump Jr. at an airport.”

Michael Cohen, Trump`s former personal attorney, leaves Capitol Hill on Thursday. (Susan Walsh/AP)

-- Michael Cohen plans on telling lawmakers that Trump repeatedly asked him about a skyscraper project in Moscow long after securing the Republican nomination, Reuters’s Nathan Layne and Ginger Gibson report: “Cohen’s assertion that Trump was inquiring about the project as late as June 2016, if true, would show Trump remained personally interested in a business venture in Russia well into his candidacy. Cohen, scheduled to report to prison in May, has already said he briefed Trump on the project in June 2016. ... In addition, Cohen will offer new information on Trump’s financial statements that ‘have never been produced before’ relating to how Trump represented the values of his assets in financial transactions and other matters,” according to a person familiar with the matter.

-- Here are some other questions Cohen might answer during his testimony on Wednesday, as compiled by Matt Zapotosky and Rosalind S. Helderman:

Who are the “White House-based staff and legal counsel” to Trump that Cohen remained in contact with, and what instruction did they give him about his testimony in Congress, in which he ultimately lied to lawmakers?

Did Trump personally direct Cohen to lie, and did he tell that to the special counsel’s office?

Does Cohen believe Trump obstructed any investigation, and does he have evidence to prove that?

Was Cohen ever offered a pardon in exchange for being silent?

To Cohen’s knowledge, was Trump informed by his son Donald Trump Jr. or anyone else before his son took a meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016?

Did Cohen discuss payments to Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels with other members of the Trump family? With other campaign officials?

Does Cohen believe that Trump or anyone associated with his campaign coordinated with a Russian effort to interfere in the U.S. election?

-- House investigators are probing the president’s contacts with then-acting attorney general Matt Whitaker after reports that Trump asked Whitaker whether U.S. attorney Geoffrey Berman could un-recuse himself to intervene in Cohen’s case. The Wall Street Journal’s Rebecca Ballhaus and Dustin Volz report: “There is no sign Mr. Whitaker acted on any request from Mr. Trump … But the House Judiciary Committee is investigating whether Mr. Whitaker may have perjured himself in his appearance before the panel earlier this month, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Mr. Whitaker told the panel: ‘At no time has the White House asked for nor have I provided any promises or commitments concerning the special counsel’s investigation or any other investigation.’ Any evidence that Mr. Trump sought to intervene in the federal prosecutors’ probe could propel further lines of inquiry by lawmakers into whether he has tried to obstruct the investigation into his business dealings.”

-- The Trump Organization asked the House Judiciary Committee to stop investigating the company, accusing the panel of hiring a lawyer with a conflict of interest. John Wagner and Tom Hamburger report: “In a letter Monday to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), Trump Organization lawyer Alan S. Futerfas objected to the committee’s hiring of Berry H. Berke on the grounds that his law firm, Kramer Levin, has represented the Trump Organization on an array of issues. ‘This state of affairs violates recognized ethical obligations and irreparably taints the Committee’s work,’ Futerfas wrote … In a statement, Kramer Levin called the Trump Organization’s letter to Nadler ‘baseless’ and said Berke’s consulting work for the Judiciary Committee ‘complies fully with all applicable ethical rules, does not pose any conflicts of interest and respects any obligations the firm may have.’”

-- Trump has asked his outside legal team to remain with him as investigations continue to unfold. The Daily Beast’s Asawin Suebsaeng and Erin Banco report: “The president broached the topic of keeping his team together starting late last year, according to two sources familiar with the exchanges, by discussing other legal woes he might face after the Special Counsel’s Office submits its report to the Department of Justice. Trump’s focus at the time? The Southern District of New York. … Despite all the bustle surrounding the submission of a Mueller report, sources close to the president say Trump’s legal team remains focused on pending matters in New York, as well as preparing for whatever other legal fallout could come stemming from Mueller’s Russia investigation.”

-- Washington’s Prettyman Courthouse has become a public stage for the Mueller investigation. On days when Trump associates are questioned, more than a hundred people routinely line up to catch a glimpse of the action. Avi Selk reports: “The people came for Roger Stone’s hearing, as they have been coming to other Trump confidant hearings in this building for months — sleuthing for clues, or awaiting grand jury smoke signals, or simply compelled to be proximate to what could be the most potent criminal case since Watergate. … There were people in matching blue suits, in sloganed sweatshirts and sneakers. One man brought a guitar case for reasons unknown. Court security guards impersonated bouncers, snatching forbidden camera phones out of the queue and turning handbags inside out. Snippets of hazy, speculative chatter issued from the queuers, as if they were in line at a movie theater discussing the fate of some character: ‘I hope Roger gets a taste.’ ‘Roger is looking for the next piece.’ … The courthouse is also where Mueller’s grand jury regularly convenes behind closed doors with no public warning, weighing evidence the public may never see, making decisions that could affect the United States for years to come.”

ANOTHER ACCUSER:

-- A former staffer on the president’s 2016 campaign has filed a lawsuit in which she claims Trump forcibly kissed her before a Florida rally. The White House denies it. Beth Reinhard and Alice Crites report: “In interviews and in the lawsuit, Alva Johnson said Trump grabbed her hand and leaned in to kiss her on the lips as he exited an RV outside the rally in Tampa on Aug. 24, 2016. Johnson said she turned her head and the unwanted kiss landed on the side of her mouth. In a statement, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders dismissed Johnson’s allegation as ‘absurd on its face.’ ‘This never happened and is directly contradicted by multiple highly credible eye witness accounts,’ she wrote. Two Trump supporters that Johnson identified as witnesses — a campaign official and Pam Bondi, then the Florida attorney general — denied seeing the alleged kiss in interviews with The Washington Post.

“As recently as May 2017, Johnson spoke glowingly of Trump in a radio interview. ‘He is more incredible in person than I think you would even think as you see him on TV,’ she told the Alabama-based program ‘Politics and Moore.’ ‘He’s just the nicest guy. … He treats everyone as if they are a part of his family.’ She also said she expected to be given a job as the ‘second-in-command’ at the U.S. Embassy in Lisbon. ‘I will at some point be heading over to Portugal to work in the embassy,’ she said. The Post found the recording of the show after the first version of this story was published. One of Johnson’s lawyers, Hassan Zavareei, said that at the time of the radio interview, she was bound by a nondisclosure agreement and was ‘saying what she thought Trump and his supporters wanted.’ …

“Johnson said she told her boyfriend, mother and stepfather about the alleged kiss on the day that it occurred, an account all three confirmed to The Post. Two months later, Johnson consulted a Florida attorney; he gave The Post text messages showing that he considered her ‘credible’ but did not take her case for business reasons. The attorney gave Johnson the name of a therapist, whose notes, which The Post reviewed, reference an unspecified event during the campaign that had left her distraught. … Johnson, an event planner who lives in Madison County, Ala., is seeking unspecified damages for emotional pain and suffering. The federal lawsuit, filed Monday in Florida, also alleges that the campaign discriminated against Johnson, who is black, by paying her less than her white male counterparts. A campaign spokeswoman, Kayleigh McEnany, rejected that claim as ‘off-base and unfounded.’”

-- “The most legally significant aspect of Johnson’s suit may ultimately be something the complaint does not explicitly address: the pervasive use of nondisclosure agreements by Trump during his campaign and in his Administration,” Ronan Farrow adds in the New Yorker. “Johnson’s suit is at least the sixth legal case in which Trump campaign or Administration employees have defied their nondisclosure agreements. Three of those actions, including Johnson’s, were filed this month. ... Legal experts said that Johnson’s case, and the broader pattern of high-profile legal skirmishes over Trump’s use of nondisclosure agreements, could produce significant legal rulings and affect the President’s ability to enforce the contracts.”

-- Johnson’s attorney said Trump’s reaction to the violence in Charlottesville helped persuade her client to come forward. The Daily Beast’s Olivia Messer reports: “Zavareei said that Johnson watched—and suffered—with each national controversy, including when Trump enacted a policy of separating migrant children from their parents coming into the United States without documentation. ‘It made her feel like she had some responsibility, having worked on his campaign,’ said Zavareei.”

POWER PLAYERS:

-- Justice Elena Kagan could cast the deciding vote in one of the year’s biggest cases: whether the Bladensburg Peace Cross dedicated to Marylanders killed in World War I stays or goes. Robert Barnes has a fun preview of oral arguments scheduled for tomorrow: “Kagan has emerged as one of the Supreme Court’s most powerful voices on the separation of church and state, often rebuking conservative colleagues for allowing government actions that she says favor one religion over another. But the last time the justices considered the fate of a cross constructed on public land, Kagan was on the other side of the bench and on one side of the issue. As President Barack Obama’s solicitor general, Kagan successfully defended a cross in the Mojave National Preserve, convincing the court’s conservatives that what she unwaveringly referred to as a ‘war memorial’ should remain as a tribute to the sacrifice of World War I dead. …

“One of only four women to serve on the Supreme Court, Kagan is the least in the public eye. Although she is consistently on the court’s left, she crosses over more often than the better-known Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor. But she is a favorite of those who follow and practice before the court. Lawyers who argue conservative causes say she is the justice most likely to probe the weak spots of their cases. And law professors across the ideological spectrum praise her clear and often colloquial writing style.”

-- Nikki Haley is launching a policy group as the former U.N. ambassador deflects questions about a potential 2024 presidential bid. Anne Gearan reports: “She insists she is not planning that far ahead, even as her range of activities suggest she is keeping her options open. … The organization’s initial list of subjects reflects Haley’s conservative worldview and political instincts, while its website features photographs of Haley traveling the world as U.N. ambassador and taking questions in the White House briefing room. The group’s policy positions mostly align with Trump’s, while also bearing echoes of traditional Republican views that have taken a back seat during the populist-flavored Trump era. She is tougher rhetorically on Russia than her former boss usually is and says she disagrees with Trump’s preference for punitive tariffs as a negotiating tactic in trade disputes.”

-- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has undergone a transformation from Trump’s virulent 2016 primary opponent to one of the president’s biggest backers, isolating some of his colleagues in the process. Mark Leibovich (of “This Town” fame) profiles Graham for Sunday’s New York Times Magazine:

Graham acknowledged he has cozied up to Trump to remain “relevant” ahead of his reelection bid next year: “‘Well, O.K., from my point of view, if you know anything about me, it’d be odd not to do this,’ he said. I asked what ‘this’ was. ‘This,’ Graham said, ‘is to try to be relevant.’ Politics, he explained, was the art of what works and what brings desired outcomes. ‘I’ve got an opportunity up here working with the president to get some really good outcomes for the country,’ he told me.”

“‘Well, O.K., from my point of view, if you know anything about me, it’d be odd not to do this,’ he said. I asked what ‘this’ was. ‘This,’ Graham said, ‘is to try to be relevant.’ Politics, he explained, was the art of what works and what brings desired outcomes. ‘I’ve got an opportunity up here working with the president to get some really good outcomes for the country,’ he told me.” The senator offered a calculated answer when asked whether he trusted Trump: “Graham’s eyes seemed to bulge for a split second. He sat back in his chair and paused. ‘That’s a good question,’ he told me. He paused some more. ‘Do I trust him?’ he said at last. ‘I trust the president to want to be successful,’ he said. The president’s mercurialness, he acknowledged, could be a problem.”

“Graham’s eyes seemed to bulge for a split second. He sat back in his chair and paused. ‘That’s a good question,’ he told me. He paused some more. ‘Do I trust him?’ he said at last. ‘I trust the president to want to be successful,’ he said. The president’s mercurialness, he acknowledged, could be a problem.” “ This combination of factors gave rise to the ‘What happened to Lindsey Graham?’ question , which has become synonymous enough with the South Carolinian’s national political identity that he felt compelled to own it on the stump. ‘ What happened to me?’ Graham asked in Greenville. ‘Not a damn thing.’ The crowd gave him a standing ovation.”

, which has become synonymous enough with the South Carolinian’s national political identity that he felt compelled to own it on the stump. ‘ The crowd gave him a standing ovation.” Graham’s angry defense of Brett Kavanaugh has particularly affected the senator’s relationship with erstwhile Democratic allies: “Senator Chris Coons, the Delaware Democrat, told me that his longtime colleague is ‘hysterically funny’ and ‘personally engaging.’ But the personal nature of Graham’s outburst at the hearing left him stunned. ‘It was unprecedented,’ Coons said, adding that he and Graham did not speak for several weeks afterward. ‘I am still struggling to renew my working relationship with Senator Graham,’ he added.”

-- Former Fed chair Janet Yellen said she does not believe Trump understands macroeconomics. “I doubt that he would even be able to say that the Fed’s goals are maximum employment and price stability, which is the goals that Congress have assigned to the Fed,” Yellen said in a Marketplace interview. “He’s made comments about the Fed having an exchange rate objective in order to support his trade plans, or possibly targeting the U.S. balance of trade. And, you know, I think comments like that shows a lack of understanding of the impact of the Fed on the economy, and appropriate policy goals.” (Politico)

THE REST OF THE DOMESTIC AGENDA:

-- The Senate blocked a bill that would have punished doctors for failing to provide full medical care to a child born alive after an attempted abortion. Felicia Sonmez reports: “All but three Democrats voted against a procedural motion on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, denying it the necessary 60 votes to proceed. … The bill includes criminal penalties, a right of civil action for an affected mother and a mandatory reporting requirement for other health providers. Opponents of the bill argued that it represented an unjustified attack on abortion rights, preventing doctors from exercising their best medical judgment and exposing them to possible lawsuits or prosecution. … Several medical groups, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Women’s Association and the American Public Health Association … have publicly opposed the bill ... The Republican push to pass these bills follows efforts in New York and Virginia to roll back restrictions surrounding late-term abortions.

-- A federal judge said the bump-stock ban enacted by the Trump administration can stand. Meagan Flynn reports: “U.S. District Judge Dabney L. Friedrich found that the Firearms Policy Coalition and other groups did not put forth any convincing legal arguments in favor of stopping the Trump administration from carrying out the ban, which targets a device used in the 2017 Las Vegas massacre, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Friedrich, a 2017 appointee of President Trump to the District of Columbia, ruled it was ‘reasonable’ of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to conclude that a bump-stock, which uses the recoil energy from a rifle to automatically fire the next round, performs the same function as a machine gun and should therefore be banned just like machine guns under federal law.”

-- Several House Democrats requested information from the Pentagon on how it screens military recruits after service members were recently arrested in cases involving white supremacy. The lawmakers asked how these recruits were able to circumvent the military’s checks with their extremist views, which they said posed a “significant concern, particularly given their combat and weapons training.” (Dan Lamothe)

-- A 24-year-old Honduran woman’s pregnancy ended in a stillbirth while she was being held at an ICE detention center. Reis Thebault reports: “The woman ... was arrested near Hidalgo, Tex., on Feb. 18. She was six months pregnant at the time. Four days later, she went into labor and delivered a premature and unresponsive baby boy. Local doctors pronounced the newborn dead soon after. … ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection doesn’t count stillbirths as in-custody deaths; rather, they’re recorded in their own category, along with miscarriages. … The stillbirth will probably raise new questions about ICE’s policy of detaining pregnant women, which changed from a ‘presumption of release for all pregnant detainees’ after an executive order from President Trump directed the agency ‘to enforce the immigration laws of the United States against all removable aliens.’”

-- Border officials didn’t receive guidance on the “zero tolerance” policy until after Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen enacted it. From BuzzFeed News’s Hamed Aleaziz: “The guidance was delivered May 4, 2018, nearly a month after then-attorney general Jeff Sessions announced that Justice Department prosecutors would charge all individuals who crossed the southern border without authorization under a zero tolerance policy. Even then, the memo appeared to leave some room for confusion among officials, who said they would apply ‘common sense’ until additional clarification and guidance was issued.”

-- The Interior Department has given offshore oil drillers nearly 1,700 waivers to Obama-era safety regulations put in place after the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil disaster. From Politico’s Ben Lefebvre: “The waivers mostly focused on 53 provisions of the final Obama-era rule that took effect at the end of July 2016 and which the industry had complained were the most burdensome. The Trump administration has begun to ease those provisions under its own rulemaking that began in May 2018. Those revisions are currently under review at the Office of Management and Budget. … BP, Chevron, Hess, Anadarko Petroleum and other companies that had applied for roughly 1,300 Gulf drilling permits during the 20-month period … More than a third of the 1,679 waivers granted during those 20 months allowed companies to deviate from regulations concerning tests that companies must perform on blowout preventers.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) announced she will not participate in a high-dollar fundraising program during her bid for the Democratic nomination. “Candidates spend too much time with wealthy donors, and I’ve made a decision to change that,” she wrote in an email to supporters. “That means no fancy receptions or big money fundraisers only with people who can write the big checks. It means that wealthy donors won’t be able to purchase better seats or one-on-one time with me at our events.”

Reading between the lines: “Warren has acknowledged in her fundraising emails that she hasn’t achieved her online targets, a problem confirmed by a person familiar with her campaign’s finances,” Annie Linskey reports. “The move will provide Warren’s camp with a ready-made excuse if her first-quarter fundraising totals are lower than expected. Those figures are released in mid-April and are traditionally seen as an early gauge of a candidate’s strength. … Closing the door to high-dollar events will put even more pressure on her to come up with smaller contributions.”

-- Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he has already raised $10 million since announcing his bid last week. The New York Times’s Shane Goldmacher reports: “But perhaps just as daunting a figure for his rivals is this: Nearly 39 percent of those donors used an email address that had never before been used to give to Mr. Sanders. For Mr. Sanders, the flood of money from fresh email addresses suggested to his team that he was dramatically expanding a donor network that had already dwarfed his 2020 competition.”

-- Bernie is also preparing to release 10 years of his tax returns, according to the National Journal’s Hanna Trudo: “The display of personal financial transparency goes well beyond what the Vermont independent did during his 2016 presidential bid, when he failed to produce a comprehensive look at prior returns. … Sanders brought in roughly $1.75 million in book royalties across 2016 and 2017, on top of his $174,000 Senate salary. But he still ranks among the least wealthy senators, according to the most recent public data.”

-- During a CNN town hall last night, Sanders praised Trump for his willingness to meet with Kim. The senator also pledged to support the Democratic presidential candidate, no matter who it ends up being, and said that learning about allegations of sexual harassment within his campaign was very painful. He promised it “will not happen again.” (CNN)

-- Trump’s former deputy campaign manager David Bossie is using a collection of endorsements from prominent Maryland Republicans for the president’s reelection campaign to discourage Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) from a 2020 primary challenge. Jenna Johnson, Robert Costa and Arelis R. Hernández report: “Bossie, who is one of two Republican National Committee representatives for Maryland, spoke at the Montgomery County GOP Convention on Saturday. There he met privately with allies of the president to discuss assembling a statement that would send a clear signal to Hogan (R) about Trump’s support in the state as the governor mulls a 2020 bid … the statement, which is not yet finalized, is expected to express support for Hogan as governor while fully backing Trump in the 2020 presidential election. … Hogan criticized Bossie’s attempt to divide Republicans in his state. ‘These kind of heavy-handed tactics are not what we need in our politics. We should be focused on encouraging discussion and debate, not seeking to divide,’ Hogan said.”

-- Hillary Clinton is not running in 2020, but her presence is still felt. From the Times’ Shane Goldmacher and Lisa Lerer: “Whether it is building or deepening a relationship with Mrs. Clinton — or navigating or repairing a long-term one — the men and women in the 2020 race must grapple with how the 2016 nominee will factor into the next 18 months."" Not everyone has reached out to Clinton, including Bernie Sanders, Beto O’Rourke and, more notably, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. According to a Clinton strategist, she doesn’t plan on endorsing a primary candidate but will support the eventual nominee.

-- Democratic campaigns are grappling with whether they should pursue the Rust Belt states that Trump carried in 2016 or chase Sun Belt states trending purple. The Times’s Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns report: “There is a growing school of thought that Democrats should not spend so much time, money and psychic energy tailoring their message to a heavily white, rural and blue-collar part of the country when their coalition is increasingly made up of racial minorities and suburbanites. … The dispute is not merely a tactical one — it goes to the heart of how Democrats envision themselves becoming a majority party. The question is whether that is accomplished through a focus on kitchen-table topics like health care and jobs, aimed at winning moderates and disaffected Trump voters, or by unapologetically elevating matters of race and identity, such as immigration, to mobilize young people and minorities with new fervor.”

-- On the other side of the aisle: Major GOP donors fear Trump will not be able to hold on to Rust Belt states in 2020. Politico’s Anita Kumar and Maggie Severns report: “Late last month, more than 100 major Republican donors gathered at the Trump International Hotel for a presentation from the president’s campaign manager Brad Parscale and other top political hands on their plans to keep the White House in 2020 after a brutal midterm election. … According to two attendees, campaign officials acknowledged that Trump is under-performing in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, though they said he is holding steady in Florida and trending upward in Ohio. But they offered no details on what they`re doing to regain ground in the Midwest, the attendees said.”

-- Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is making an early play for the support of grass-roots groups in South Carolina. The State’s Emma Dumain reports: “In interviews with nearly a dozen S.C. advocacy groups — many of them local chapters of national progressive organizations — representatives report they so far only have heard from the campaign of [Harris]. Harris’ strategy has been to reach out to these groups early, long before anyone is prepared to offer an endorsement, in hopes of laying the groundwork for future support. … So far, the strategy is paying off. Activists in the traditionally conservative state are excited about being courted, listened to and valued.”

-- Former White House official Anthony Scaramucci said Trump would be worried if former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg runs for president. Scaramucci said Bloomberg is “the one that the president would be quietly worried about” because he has the “mental discipline” to handle challenges posed by Trump. Bloomberg, a registered Democrat, hasn`t announced his intention to run yet, but fellow billionaire Warren Buffett already said he will support his bid. (CNBC)

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Vice President Pence announced new sanctions against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in the Trump administration’s latest effort to force the autocratic leader out of office. Anne Gearan, Anthony Faiola and Carol Morello report: “Pence arrived in [Bogota, Colombia] to reiterate that Washington will not back away from diplomatic confrontation. His trip comes as some in the Venezuelan opposition have begun openly calling for the use of `force` to oust Maduro’s socialist government. Pence did not publicly back immediate military force, but he reiterated a long-standing administration stance that all options were being considered. … Pence later acknowledged to reporters that Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó has sought assurances that the United States could use force if necessary, but the vice president did not set a red line for that decision or hint at what he would recommend to Trump.”

-- Univision journalist Jorge Ramos and his team were detained at Maduro`s presidential palace after showing him a video of Venezuelans eating out of a garbage truck, Ramos said. Reis Thebault, Michael Brice-Saddler and Eli Rosenberg report: “The group was freed shortly after, said Daniel Coronell, Univision’s president for news in the United States. Coronell said Venezuelan government officials confiscated the journalists’ equipment. Ramos, in a phone interview with Univision after he was released, said the interview with Maduro lasted about 17 minutes. `He didn’t like the things we were asking him about the lack of democracy in Venezuela, about torture, political prisoners, the humanitarian crisis that they were living,` he said. ... Ramos said the interview they recorded was also taken.”

This is the video that Ramos said upset Maduro:

-- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad made an unannounced visit to Iran to discuss U.S. policy with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani. From the AP’s Nasser Karimi and Albert Aji: “Iran’s semi-official Fars news agency said Khamenei told the visiting Assad that ‘the buffer zone that Americans are after in Syria is among dangerous plots that should be rejected,’ and that the U.S. plan to maintain a presence in Syria near the Iraqi border ‘is another sample of their designs.’ … Assad accused the U.S. and its regional allies like Saudi Arabia of creating rifts among various religious and ethnic groups in Syria, saying such efforts have backfired.”

-- Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif abruptly resigned, via Instagram. Erin Cunningham and Carol Morello report: “The move by Zarif, a well-liked diplomat both at home and abroad, could upend Iran’s foreign policy at a critical time for the Islamic republic, which is suffering from renewed U.S. sanctions. … The reason for Zarif’s resignation was not disclosed. Nor is it clear whether top Iranian officials will accept the resignation, and there were immediately conflicting reports about whether President Hassan Rouhani had already rejected it. ‘He has handed in his resignation, but that doesn’t mean that this is the end of this story,’ said Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council in Washington. … Zarif’s departure may be rooted in domestic issues, rather than foreign policy, because there are no significant prospects for negotiations on either Iran’s nuclear program or on the issues of concern to Europeans and Americans.”

-- U.S. senators predict a vote on whether to end U.S. involvement in Yemen as soon as next week. From Reuters’s Patricia Zengerle: “Officials from the U.S. State and Defense Departments met with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee behind closed doors on Monday to discuss the situation in Yemen, amid a months-long outcry in Congress about Saudi Arabia. ‘I don’t think they won any hearts and minds,’ Democratic Senator Chris Murphy told reporters as he left the briefing. Critics of Riyadh, including some of President Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, have blasted a Saudi-led coalition waging an air campaign in Yemen’s civil war over high civilian casualties.”

-- China`s Xi Jinping is nervous about the multiple major risks the Communist Party faces this year. The New York Times`s Chris Buckley reports: Xi “abruptly summoned hundreds of officials to Beijing recently, forcing some to reschedule long-planned local assemblies. ... `Globally, sources of turmoil and points of risk are multiplying,` he told the gathering in January at the Central Party School. At home, he added, `the party is at risk from indolence, incompetence and of becoming divorced from the public.` ... There are no political challengers on the horizon who could pose an immediate threat to the Communist Party or Mr. Xi. But his remarks made clear that especially in 2019 — a year of politically sensitive anniversaries — the party would aggressively extinguish sparks that could ignite protests and turbulence.”

-- Also nervous? U.S. businessmen in China. According to a survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China, two-thirds of U.S. businesses in China have suffered as a result of the trade war between the world’s two largest economies. But there`s still general support for the president`s approach to Beijing. Anna Fifield reports: “Trump’s constant exhortations for American businesses to move their operations back home, coupled with Chinese [Xi’s] calls for `self reliance,` have only exacerbated business concerns about a protracted trade war leading to what is sometimes called economic `decoupling` — the world’s two biggest economies trying to separate from each other... Still, the American companies generally felt that the pain would be worth it if the Trump administration could force China to make structural changes in its economy that would create better business conditions.”

-- The Post is launching a fellowship in honor of the paper’s late contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Saudi Arabian writer and activist Hala Al-Dosari was named the first recipient of the fellowship, which offers a platform for journalists who come from parts of the world where freedom of expression is restricted.

-- Israel leader Benjamin Netanyahu`s opponent Benny Gatz is surging in polls after joining forces with the country`s second-largest opposition party. Alon Yakter and Mark Tessler explain why: “Gantz’s centrist political party, Blue and White, leads the opposition despite being particularly vague on Israel’s most important ideological cleavage: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In what has become something of a joke, Gantz has both stated that he would seek peace through compromise with the Palestinians and has run graphic ads boasting of the damage inflicted on Palestinians in Gaza during his time as head” of the Israel Defense Forces.

GOOD READS:

-- The Verge, “The Trauma Floor: The secret lives of Facebook moderators in America,” by Casey Newton: “It’s a place where, in stark contrast to the perks lavished on Facebook employees, team leaders micromanage content moderators’ every bathroom and prayer break; where employees, desperate for a dopamine rush amid the misery, have been found having sex inside stairwells and a room reserved for lactating mothers; where people develop severe anxiety while still in training, and continue to struggle with trauma symptoms long after they leave; and where the counseling that Cognizant offers them ends the moment they quit — or are simply let go. The moderators told me it’s a place where the conspiracy videos and memes that they see each day gradually lead them to embrace fringe views. One auditor walks the floor promoting the idea that the Earth is flat. A former employee told me he has begun to question certain aspects of the Holocaust.”

-- “At Deadspin, can the cool kids of the sports Internet become its moral authority?” by Ben Strauss: “In its early years, Deadspin was an irreverent boys club. It called out the stuffiness of ESPN’s analysts and exposed network executives for having an extramarital affair … As its national profile grew exponentially, it also suffered from charges of sexism and homophobia, crossing journalistic lines and moral lines — with few apologies. … These days, the most shocking and paid-for scoops in sports typically are found at TMZ, while a coterie of other outlets and reporters thoroughly cover ESPN and provide the media criticism Deadspin made famous. Deadspin has evolved into an unabashedly progressive voice in sports and beyond. … Deadspin is currently for sale by parent company Univision, but even as it wrestles with the uncertain economics of digital media, there is a more fundamental question for the site. The enfant terrible has grown up: Is the new version righteous or self-righteous?”

Her desperate family won`t give up,” by Kate Hodal: “There is no single database that tracks the number of Native women who go missing or are murdered every year. But FBI figures show that Native Americans disappear at twice the per capita rate of white Americans – despite comprising a far smaller population. Last year, after more than two dozen Native Americans, most of them women, went missing in Montana alone, state senator Jon Tester declared the number of missing and murdered Indigenous women (MMIW) across America an ‘epidemic’ and vowed to find solutions. ‘People ask me: “Why are these women going missing? Is it the cartels?”’ says cartographer Annita Lucchesi, a Southern Cheyenne descendant who is building the first ever US- and Canada-wide database devoted solely to missing and murdered indigenous women. `It’s not the cartels – although that does happen – it’s the devaluation of Native women.`""

NEWS YOU CAN USE IF YOU LIVE IN D.C.:

-- The wind is winding down and the rest of the week should be calmer, but prepare for potential snow on Thursday or Friday. The Capital Weather Gang forecasts: “After a windy start to the week, our weather calms down for a few days with seasonably cool conditions. But then the next storm system complicates the weather late Thursday into Friday. We could see some snow or mixed precipitation before milder weather and rain late Friday into Saturday.”

-- A white Maryland lawmaker apologized to the leaders of the state`s Legislative Black Caucus after allegedly using the n-word with her colleagues. Ovetta Wiggins reports: “Caucus members confronted Del. Mary Ann Lisanti (D) on Monday night over allegations that she told a white colleague, during an after-hours gathering at an Annapolis cigar bar, that when he campaigned in Prince George’s on behalf of a candidate last fall he was door-knocking in a `n----- district.` ... Her apologies came after each of the seven members of the caucus’s executive committee told her how they felt upon learning that their colleague allegedly used the racial slur.”

-- Overwhelmingly white school districts received $23 billion more in state and local funding than predominantly nonwhite school districts in 2016, according to a new report. But school district organization in states such as Maryland and Virginia make funding more equitable. Laura Meckler reports: “The problem is worse in states where districts are small, cordoning off wealthy communities and limiting the likelihood that wealthier taxpayers will subsidize poorer students, said Rebecca Sibilia, EdBuild’s chief executive. In states such as Maryland and Virginia, she said, many school districts are comprised of entire counties, making funding more equitable. In Maryland, 880,000 students are served by just 24 districts, vs. New Jersey, where 1.3 million students are divided between 540 districts. Nonwhite districts in Maryland received $501 more per student than white districts, and in Virginia, they got $255 more per student.”

"‘One of the most brutal races in the country’ has just begun in Florida.

“In 2020, the Electoral College vote forces us to win in both places,” says Robby Mook, the 2016 campaign manager for Hillary Clinton. “But over time, because of population shifts, I think we are going to spend a lot more time in the Sun Belt.”

This long-term geographic reconfiguration reflects the shifting demographics in each party’s coalition—a transformation that Trump’s tumultuous presidency is accelerating. Trump is intensifying the GOP’s strength among older, blue-collar, and rural whites. But his style and agenda are simultaneously alienating younger and nonwhite voters, and straining the GOP’s grip on college-educated whites, especially women.

The shift toward the GOP among older whites threatens the long-term position of Democrats in a wide array of states across the country’s heartland, where those adults constitute a critical mass.

In this year’s Senate contests, Democrats appear to have stabilized their position in several of the industrial states, with incumbents generally considered strong favorites for reelection in Michigan (Debbie Stabenow), Ohio (Sherrod Brown), and Pennsylvania (Bob Casey), along with a more equivocal favorite in Wisconsin (Tammy Baldwin). But the GOP’s strength among older and blue-collar whites has still placed Republican challengers in a strong position to oust Democratic Senators Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota, Joe Donnelly in Indiana, Claire McCaskill in Missouri, and—to a somewhat lesser extent—Joe Manchin in West Virginia and Jon Tester in Montana. All of those are preponderantly white and heavily blue-collar states where Trump remains much more popular than he is nationally.

The resilience of industrial-state incumbents such as Brown, Stabenow, and Casey makes clear that Democrats aren’t facing imminent extinction in the heartland; they are even well positioned to potentially recapture several governorships there this year. But the potential losses among the second group of senators, who are defending more rural states, underscore the likelihood that the Democratic position in the heartland will continue to erode over time, particularly as the GOP appeals more overtly to white anxiety over demographic and cultural change.

As that occurs, Democrats through the 2020s will need greater gains in the Sun Belt to fill the gap at every level—in contests for the House, the Senate, and the Electoral College. Since 2008, Democrats have already brought into their camp two Sun Belt states that reliably leaned Republican through the early-21st century: Virginia and Colorado. New Mexico, a longtime swing state, has also tilted blue, with Clinton carrying it comfortably, Democrats holding both Senate seats, and Representative Michelle Lujan Grisham, the party’s nominee, in a close contest to recapture the governorship.", How the Democratic Party Can Turn the Sun Belt Blue ,2-2019
"When he was deployed to Iraq in 2005, Army Sgt. E-5 Steven Acheson was assigned to the security detail of a high-ranking officer, driving a Humvee over IED-infested roads on more than 400 missions, as the violent insurgency tore the country apart.

During his deployment, he suffered an accident that left him with a herniated disc. He had also begun experiencing symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

""Nightmares and strange things would happen in the middle of the night. I`d gouge the side of my face with my fingernails, and all kinds of interesting things were going on,"" Acheson, now 33, said.

His back injury went untreated, eventually requiring two surgeries. His doctors prescribed pain medication to help with his recovery.

""They just almost overnight filled me up with pills,"" Acheson said. ""I remember getting bags of pills mailed to my front door. I didn`t even have to leave my house to become a drug addict.""

He left active duty in 2008 and began pursuing an engineering degree, transitioning to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health system. But Acheson said he found it ""almost impossible"" to function while taking OxyContin, a powerful opioid.

Steven Acheson Steven Acheson

Then he found something else that helped: marijuana. A friend on campus offered it to him, and it was like a ""lightswitch going off."" Eventually he was able to stop taking pain pills entirely.

But medical marijuana was and remains illegal in his home state of Wisconsin, and even in the 33 states where it is legal, patients in the VA system don`t have access to it. The Food and Drug Administration classifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance, the same category as heroin and ecstasy. While VA doctors can discuss marijuana use with patients, they can`t recommend patients use it or help them obtain it.

The VA also won`t reimburse veterans if they obtain marijuana through other means. Acheson wants that changed, arguing the VA should consider medical marijuana no different than other forms of treatment veterans obtain through private providers.

""They do it already with acupuncture. They do it already with chiropractic work. They do it already with a number of things health care related that the VA just can`t provide. I don`t see any reason why on a state by state basis, we can`t be doing the same thing with cannabis,"" Acheson said.

Acheson is now the co-founder and director of the group High Ground Veterans Advocacy, and co-founder of Wisconsin Veterans for Compassionate Care. He has also become an advocate for medical marijuana in Wisconsin, where the new Democratic governor supports medical marijuana legalization and decriminalization of small amounts for recreational use.

On the federal level, there are signs that support for expanding access to medical marijuana for veterans is growing. In February, Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Brian Schatz of Hawaii introduced the Veterans Medical Marijuana Safe Harbor Act to allow VA doctors to discuss and recommend medical marijuana to veterans in states where it is already legal.

In 2018, the group Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans for America (IAVA) surveyed 4,600 of its veteran members and found 55 percent of respondents said they want greater access to medical marijuana. Eighty-three percent said cannabis should be legal for medicinal purposes. About a quarter said they had used marijuana for medicinal purposes.

""Our veterans want access to the same care and options as their civilian counterparts. It is frustrating that the VA would prefer a world where those who have served their country have access to fewer treatment options than those who have not,"" IAVA CEO Jeremy Butler said in a statement.

A need for more research



Advocates for expanding access to medicinal marijuana say allowing and supporting research into marijuana`s medicinal properties is just as important. In the IAVA survey, 72 percent of respondents said cannabis should be researched for medicinal uses, and 68 percent strongly agreed the VA should allow for cannabis research as a treatment option.

As a Schedule I drug, federal law imposes strict controls on researchers hoping to study the effects of marijuana. But there is a growing bipartisan push on Capitol Hill to expand studies into whether and how cannabis could be used by veterans to treat PTSD.

In January, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana and Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Arkansas introduced the VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act of 2019, which would direct the VA to perform clinical research on the safety and efficacy of medical marijuana in treating both PTSD and chronic pain. Reps. Lou Correa, a Democrat from California, and Clay Higgins, a Republican from Louisiana, filed identical legislation in the House.

Rep. Phil Roe, the top Republican on the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, also introduced his own bill directing the VA to research the drug.

""As a doctor myself, I am a firm believer in the importance of medical research to assure that a treatment is safe and effective,"" Roe said. ""If research on the usage of medical cannabis is favorable, I am confident that it could become another option to help improve the lives of veterans and other Americans.""

Researchers say they could be close to uncovering valuable information about the efficacy of cannabis to treat PTSD. Between 11 and 20 percent of veterans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan experience PTSD symptoms in a given year, according to the VA. PTSD is linked to other mental health issues like depression, and are at higher risk for drug and alcohol abuse.

Last week, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies announced the completion of the first randomized controlled trial of ""whole plant"" marijuana used in treating PTSD. A total of 76 veterans took part in the study, smoking four different types of marijuana to test the effect on their symptoms. Dr. Sue Sisley, the study`s principal investigator, said data collected during the triple-blind study still needs to be analyzed, but said she hopes the results will be published in the coming months.

Among those awaiting the results is Dr. Marilyn Huestis, a member of the steering committee for the Lambert Center for the Study of Medicinal Cannabis and Hemp at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.

Huestis, a former researcher at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said there is already evidence that medical marijuana can help with pain management. But plenty of questions remain about how and whether it can consistently help patients suffering from PTSD.

""We don`t have a lot of good choices for PTSD. So finding something that would help these individuals would be tremendous,"" Huestis said."," Veterans urge Congress, VA to catch up on expanding access to medical marijuana ",3-2019
"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump uttered a dizzying number of false statements in his epically long weekend speech, to an audience that didn’t seem to mind at all.

He got the unemployment rate wrong. He misstated his winning margin in the election. He reprised some of his most frequently told fictions and dusted off old ones, even going back to the size of his inauguration crowd.

A look at some of his words in his two-hour-plus speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday:

UNEMPLOYMENT

TRUMP: “We’re down to 3.7 percent unemployment, the lowest number in a long time.”

THE FACTS: The unemployment rate is 4 percent. It was 3.7 percent in September.

DIVERSITY VISAS

TRUMP: On the diversity visa lottery program: “They send us the people they don’t want.”

THE FACTS: A persistent falsehood. “They,” meaning other countries, do not select citizens for the U.S. program. Foreigners decide on their own to apply for it. They must meet education or skills benchmarks to apply and those who are tentatively selected through the lottery must pass background checks before being confirmed.

Trump attributed similar characteristics to migrant caravans from Central America, suggesting governments try to get rid of their bad people by putting them in caravans for the U.S. Again, migrants are self-selected, not told to march to the U.S.

RUSSIA INVESTIGATION

TRUMP: Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigative team has “13 of the angriest Democrats in the history of our country.”

THE FACTS: Mueller is a longtime Republican and party affiliation cuts both ways — or no way at all — in the varied background of the team. Some have donated campaign money to Democrats. The team is not known to be particularly or historically angry.

CROWD SIZE

TRUMP on what he considers false reporting about his crowd sizes: “They did the same thing at our big inauguration speech. You take a look at those crowds. …We had a crowd, I’ve never seen anything like it. … There were people (from) the Capitol down to the Washington Monument.”

THE FACTS: The National Park Service released dozens of photos of the crowd gathered for his inauguration ceremony and it was clear from them that crowds did not extend to the Washington Monument from the Capitol. Large swaths of empty space were visible on the National Mall.

The park service also released photos from President Barack Obama’s two inaugurations, showing that his 2009 event far outstripped the number of people who attended Trump’s inauguration.

It released the photos in response to news media requests made through the Freedom of Information Act after Trump and his aides accused news organizations of framing or timing photos and video to make it look like not many people came.

JAMES COMEY

TRUMP: “Every single Democrat said Comey should be fired” for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails late in the campaign. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer “called for his resignation many times.”

THE FACTS: Not true. Democrats did not universally — or even broadly — call for Comey to be fired despite their anger over his decision to go public before Election Day with news that the FBI had renewed its investigation of Clinton’s handling of her emails. Several Democratic lawmakers did want him out, but they were a distinct minority.

Schumer said he had lost confidence in Comey but did not urge his removal, telling Bloomberg News he wanted to speak with the FBI chief “to restore my faith.” The House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, also held off on asking for Comey to step down, while musing: “Maybe he’s not in the right job.” Trump fired him months later.

GREEN NEW DEAL

TRUMP: “No planes, no energy. …Perhaps nothing is more extreme than the Democrats’ plan to completely take over American energy, and completely destroy America’s economy through their new $100 trillion dollar Green New Deal. …It would end air travel.”

THE FACTS: He’s ignoring the actual provisions of the plan, which would not ban air travel or end traditional sources of energy. The plan, backed by some liberal Democrats but greeted cautiously or opposed by others in the party, does call for a drastic drop in greenhouse-gas emissions from fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas.

Trump is extrapolating from a fact sheet that initially accompanied the plan, then was disavowed and withdrawn by its sponsors. It proposed building high-speed rail at a scale “where air travel stops becoming necessary.”

2016 ELECTION

TRUMP, on his Electoral College win: “We didn’t get to 270. We got 306.”

THE FACTS: Trump misstates the Electoral College vote in his 2016 presidential race against Democrat Hillary Clinton. The official count was 304 to 227, according to an Associated Press tally of the electoral votes in every state.

CHINA-TRADE

TRUMP: “We’ve lost so much money with China — $500 billion a year. And on trade, it’s such a disaster. It’s $507 billion a year. China — just one country. We lose with everybody, almost. But China is one country — $507 billion, for many years.”

THE FACTS: He’s off by several hundred billion dollars on the trade deficit with China . Trump typically ignores one part of a trading relationship, services, and considers only the other part, goods. Even by that measure, he’s wrong. On goods alone, the U.S. ran a trade deficit of $382 billion with China last year, not $507 billion. That was up from nearly $376 billion in 2017.

The U.S. is strong on services and ran a $40 billion surplus with China on that form of trade in 2017. So the actual trade deficit with China that year was $335 billon.

HEALTH CARE

TRUMP: “We have some great private coverage. And we have initiated some incredible plans, like the new cooperative plan, where you get better insurance than Obamacare for a fraction of the cost.”

THE FACTS: He’s glossing over the limitations of his administration’s expanded health care options , which involve both short term and association plans. They offer lower premiums than comprehensive plans such as those under the Affordable Care Act but cover less.

Short-term plans don’t have to take people with medical conditions or provide benefits such as coverage for maternity, mental health, prescription drugs and substance abuse treatment. Association health plans do have to accept people with pre-existing medical conditions, but they don’t have to cover the full menu of 10 “essential” kinds of benefits required by Obamacare.

Gary Claxton of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation says short-term plans may turn out to be more costly than Trump administration officials suggest. The plans now cover up to 90 days, but if insurers expand them to offer up to 36 months’ coverage, the companies will be taking on more risk. “You’ll have to pay more up front because there’s a longer time during which you could get sick,” he said.

MIDTERM ELECTIONS

TRUMP: “We were given no credit. I can’t go and campaign for all of the people in the House. There’s too many.”

TRUMP, on his endorsement of Florida candidate for governor, Ron DeSantis: “I said, ‘Ron, Don’t make me do this, Ron.’ ‘Sir, I can win.’ Alright, Ron, here we go. Because I know if he loses — which almost never happens when I endorse someone, almost never. Only one time, that was because it was done in the middle of the day of the election… But we very rarely lose.”

THE FACTS: Trump is wrong to suggest that almost every candidate he endorsed and campaigned for in the November midterm elections — except for perhaps one — won.

Two Republicans whom Trump strongly backed in their Senate races — Montana’s Matt Rosendale and West Virginia’s Patrick Morrisey — lost to Democratic Sens. Jon Tester and Joe Manchin, respectively. Trump had visited Montana four times and West Virginia three times to rally voters. Trump also campaigned for two other Senate losers: incumbent Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada and Leah Vukmir in Wisconsin.

In the House, Republican Rep. Jason Lewis lost his race in Minnesota to Democrat Angie Craig, whom he had defeated by 2 percentage points in 2016. Trump endorsed Lewis and campaigned for him.

VETERANS

TRUMP, on the Choice program for veterans: “I got that approved after 44 years of being unable to get it approved for our veterans.”

THE FACTS: False. Congress approved the private-sector Veterans Choice health program in 2014 and President Barack Obama signed it into law. Trump is expanding it .

TRUMP: “We are taking care of our veterans like they have never been taken care of before. We just got them Choice so they can now go see a doctor. Now they can go see a doctor instead of waiting on line for weeks and weeks and weeks.”

THE FACTS: Veterans still must wait for weeks.

While it’s true the VA recently announced plans to expand eligibility for veterans in the Veterans Choice program, it remains limited due in part to uncertain money and longer waits.

The program currently allows veterans to see doctors outside the VA system if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles to a VA facility. Under new rules to take effect in June, veterans will have that option for a private doctor if their VA wait is only 20 days (28 for specialty care) or their drive is only 30 minutes.

But the expanded Choice eligibility may do little to provide immediate help.

That’s because veterans often must wait even longer for an appointment in the private sector. Last year, then-Secretary David Shulkin said VA care is “often 40 percent better in terms of wait times” compared with the private sector. In 2018, 34 percent of all VA appointments were with outside physicians, down from 36 percent in 2017.

Choice came into effect after some veterans died while waiting months for appointments at the Phoenix VA medical center.

SHUTDOWN

TRUMP: “I flew to Iraq — the first time I left the White House, because I stayed at the White House for months and months because I wanted the Democrats to get back from their vacations from Hawaii and these other places.”

THE FACTS: Trump actually left the White House plenty of times during the “months and months” surrounding the partial government shutdown that began Dec. 22.

Besides his trip to Iraq and Germany on Dec. 26-27, Trump traveled to the Mexican border town of McAllen, Texas, on Jan. 10. On Jan. 14, he also went to New Orleans to address the American Farm Bureau. He’s left the White House during the five-week shutdown for meetings at Camp David and the Capitol.

Shortly before the shutdown began, he traveled to Philadelphia to watch the Army-Navy football game (Dec. 8), visited Kansas City for a law enforcement conference (Dec. 7), attended former President George H.W. Bush’s funeral at the Washington National Cathedral (Dec. 5), participated in the G-20 summit in Argentina in late November; and hosted “Make America Great Again” rallies in Mississippi with Senate candidate Cindy Hyde-Smith (Nov. 26). He hosted a dinner on Thanksgiving at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

"DENMARK, S.C. (AP) — Deanna Miller Berry doesn’t often see presidential candidates. So when New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker recently came to Bamberg County, South Carolina, she was primed to unload about a contaminated water system.

“What is your plan to fix it?” Berry asked, her eyes narrowed.

Booker, former mayor of Newark, the largest city in the most densely populated state, assured Berry he cares about the 3,000 residents of Denmark, South Carolina. “This is a time in America where too many people are feeling left out, left behind, not included,” he said, promising “a massive infrastructure investment” targeting “forgotten” places.

The exchange highlights the effort by Democratic presidential candidates to make inroads in rural America. With the first contests unfolding next year in South Carolina, Iowa and New Hampshire, small-town voters will play a critical role in choosing the next Democratic nominee. And the early attention could help the eventual nominee be more conversant on rural issues and compete for votes in places that gave President Donald Trump his most intense support in 2016.

“Organizing in every precinct is the key to winning both the caucus and the general election in Iowa,” Iowa Democratic Chairman Troy Price said.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders lamented rural decline during an Iowa swing this weekend.

“All over America, we have tragically seen more and more young people leave the small towns they grew up in, the small towns they love, because there are no decent-paying jobs in those towns — we intend to change that,” Sanders said, drawing cheers at the Iowa State Fairgrounds.

At the same time, California Sen. Kamala Harris was in small-town South Carolina advocating more spending on telemedicine, broadband internet and infrastructure. Booker used his two-day rural swing last month to talk health care, housing, infrastructure and criminal justice, among other issues. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand was the first candidate who ventured to rural northern New Hampshire. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar has already visited a tiny town in Wisconsin, which will be a general election battleground.

Several candidates plan to attend a March 30 rural issues forum at Buena Vista University in Storm Lake, Iowa — population 10,600.

The approach matters most immediately because the delegates necessary to become the nominee are awarded in part from primary and caucus results in individual congressional districts, even the most rural and Republican-leaning. But investing there also could narrow Republicans’ general election margins, by increasing turnout among Democratic-friendly constituencies like rural black and Latino voters or peeling off white voters or both.

That could flip states like Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina — even Florida — that propelled Trump to an Electoral College majority. Besides helping win the presidency, rural gains would be necessary for Democrats to have the muscle on Capitol Hill to enact the kinds of sweeping policy changes they are advocating on many fronts.

“So much of this is about the margins,” Iowa’s Price said.

Beyond the politics, candidates say rural outreach is required of anyone who wants to govern a diverse nation.

“Folks want to be seen,” Harris said. “They want their issues to be heard. ... They could care less about half the stuff that gets covered on cable news networks.”

In Wisconsin, Klobuchar said, it’s “about knowing the issues that matter to people whether they’re Democrats, Republicans and independents — and in rural areas it’s not just about the farm bill.”

The 2018 midterms demonstrated Democrats’ tough realities beyond metro areas, but still offered some bright spots.

AP VoteCast, a national survey of more than 115,000 voters, found rural and small-town residents cast 35 percent of midterm ballots; 56 percent of those voted for Republican House candidates, compared to 41 percent for Democrats. The advantage was wider among small-town and rural whites: 30 percent of the electorate, tilting 63-35 for Republicans. Correspondingly, Democrats’ net 40-seat gain in the House was driven mostly by previously GOP-leaning suburban districts, while Democratic nominees fell short in more rural areas.

There’s no consensus on whether rural success for Democrats is about policy or personality or some combination. Some winners establish a personal brand at odds with the national party — West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin defending the coal industry, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown opposing much of U.S. trade policy, Montana Sen. Jon Tester playing up his rancher credentials.

But that won’t necessarily work for a presidential candidate looking to become the face of a party with a decidedly liberal base. None of the declared candidates deviates from Democratic orthodoxy supporting abortion rights and LGBTQ civil rights and opposing Trump’s hard line on immigration — all positions that run afoul of rural and small-town voters who collectively are more culturally conservative than urban dwellers.

Sanders struggled with that balance in 2016 when Hillary Clinton hammered him for some Senate votes against gun measures that most Democrats backed. Sanders noted that many Vermonters, as in the rest of rural America, view guns differently than most big-city residents, but Clinton successfully used the issue against Sanders, particularly with black women.

Would-be Democratic presidents are left to mix economic arguments with biography.

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee grew up in Seattle, but he often mentions that he spent his early adult years in central Washington. He touts his signature issue — combating climate change — as a boon for the “heartland” economy by growing the clean-energy industry.

Klobuchar, a Twin Cities-area native, points to her work on the Senate Agriculture Committee and notes she’s won every congressional district in Minnesota during her Senate career. Sanders, who still speaks with his native Brooklyn inflection, drew roars in Iowa when mentioned using antitrust law to limit corporate power.

Harris notes that California — caricatured in Middle America as a bastion of coastal liberalism — has the nation’s biggest agricultural output. And in South Carolina, she said she heard a lot about jobs and state Republicans’ refusal to expand Medicaid insurance.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren notes that long before her Harvard law career, she was a child in Norman, Oklahoma, where her family’s working-class struggles shaped her liberal approach to consumer, labor and finance law.

After hearing Booker, Kenneth Belton, a 63-year-old resident of struggling Fairfield County, South Carolina, said a president doesn’t have to come from his walk of life. Belton just wants the person in the Oval Office to understand him — and then to help.

“It just feels like they’ve been ignoring us,” he said.

Berry, the clean water activist, agreed, crediting Booker and others for what she describes as first steps.

“I’ve heard enough to be inspired,” she said, pausing before adding, “enough to want to hear more.”", Why Democratic presidential candidates for 2020 are spending a lot of time in rural America ,3-2019
"Native American women and girls are facing an epidemic of violence that is hiding in plain sight. They are being killed or trafficked at rates far higher than the rest of the U.S. population ( on some reservations, women are 1 0 times as likely to be murdered as the national average , according to the Justice Department). Some simply disappear, presumably forced into sex trafficking .

These cases often go unsolved. Now, three senators are hoping to combat this epidemic.

The bipartisan bill, called the Not Invisible Act of 2019, was introduced last week by Lisa Murkowski, Republican from Alaska; Catherine Cortez Masto, Democrat from Nevada; and Jon Tester, Democrat from Montana. It aims to change what the Indian Law Resource Center has called a “lack of a diligent and adequate federal response” to these crimes.

The bill would create an advisory committee of local, tribal and federal stakeholders to devise best practices to combat the problem and make recommendations to government — efforts that would include paving a way for federal agencies, law enforcement and elected tribal officials to collaborate more easily.

Cortez Masto told HuffPo that she believed the bill would help federal agencies improve and quicken their response by focusing on why these women and girls are disappearing and where those who are being trafficked are going — as well as on how to collect data and educate law enforcement on sex trafficking and start prosecuting offenders.

Data on the issue is scattershot at best, but here’s some of what is known about the problem:

Opelika: A man already sentenced to federal prison in a $2 million scam pleaded guilty Tuesday to an additional charge in state court, capping an odd saga that took in an entire town. Kyle Sandler stood before Circuit Judge Christopher Hughes trembling as he pleaded guilty to a state theft charge. He apologized to the town of Opelika, where he previously admitted cheating dozens of people with promises of riches from high-tech businesses. The theft charge, involving a bad check of more than $2,500, was only a small piece of a scam authorities described as massive. Sandler founded a business called The Round House in 2014 and lured in investors while portraying himself as a wealthy former Google executive. He raised his profile by aligning himself with internet security pioneer John McAfee and promoting an area teen’s idea for a first aid vending machine.

Alaska

Anchorage: Nelson Angapak Sr. promised Sen. Ted Stevens to help Alaska Native veterans get another chance to apply for prized land allotments. It took two decades, but the 74-year-old Yup’ik leader has done it – with help from others, he points out. Congress passed a major lands bill in March that opens the door for more Native veterans to apply for tracts of land of up to 160 acres. It follows a more limited application period in 1998, an opportunity many veterans said wasn’t enough. The allotments were offered to Alaska Natives by the federal government beginning in 1906, after non-Native settlers and miners began arriving in the state and claiming Native lands. The program’s original restrictions prevented many from applying until the 1960s, says Kevin Illingworth, professor of tribal management at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The program ended in 1971, before many of the Natives in the military returned to Alaska from service in Vietnam.

Arizona

Tucson: A border activist charged with helping a pair of migrants with water, food and lodging is set to go on trial in U.S. court. Defendant Scott Daniel Warren has argued that his spiritual values compel him to help all people in distress. The trial is scheduled to begin Wednesday in Tucson, with Warren, 36, charged with harboring migrants and conspiring to transport and harbor two Mexican men found with him who were in the U.S. illegally. Thousands of migrants have died crossing the border since the mid-1990s, when heightened enforcement pushed traffic into Arizona’s scorching deserts. Prosecutors say the two migrants aided by Warren were never in any real distress.

Arkansas

Little Rock: The University of Arkansas’ board of trustees has voted to increase tuition or fees at virtually every campus in the school’s system. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that trustees approved raising tuition and fees Thursday at a rate lower than 3% at four of the five four-year universities. The decision comes after three other Arkansas public universities boosted tuition and fees for the upcoming academic year. A year earlier, all Arkansas public colleges and universities had frozen tuition prices at Gov. Asa Hutchinson’s request. The University of Arkansas in Little Rock’s tuition freeze is notable because the school faces a multimillion-dollar budget shortfall in the forthcoming year. The university elected to keep tuition at its existing level, hoping it will boost enrollment and tuition revenue.

California

Huntington Beach: Family members, friends and fans attended a Southern California beach memorial for Dick Dale, the late King of the Surf Guitar. The Orange County Register says a crowd gathered Sunday at the Huntington Beach Pier to remember Dale, who died in April at age 81. A group of surfers then took to the water for a “paddle-out,” the traditional ceremony held for fellow surfers when they die. Dale played pounding, blaringly loud power-chord instrumentals in the 1960s on songs like “Miserlou” and “Let’s Go Trippin.” An avid surfer, he built a devoted fan base across greater Los Angeles starting in the late 1950s. Dale says he developed his style by trying to merge the sounds of crashing ocean waves with rockabilly melodies.

Colorado

Denver: More than 1,700 people walking on a University of Colorado campus were unknowingly photographed as part of a facial recognition research project. The Denver Post reported Monday that professor Terrance Boult set up a long-range surveillance camera in an office window at the Colorado Springs campus. It captured more than 16,000 images of passersby during the spring semesters of 2012 and 2013. Boult says the images were collected to create a dataset as part of an effort to enhance facial recognition technology. The dataset was made publicly available online in 2016, but it was taken down in April. Boult says he waited five years to release the dataset online to protect student privacy. University spokesman Jared Verner says a panel reviewed the research protocol for the project.

Connecticut

Hartford: Gov. Ned Lamont has signed a bill that will raise the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2023. The current minimum wage of $10.10 an hour will climb through gradual increases for the next several years under the law signed Tuesday. The Democratic governor signed the law at the Parkville Care Center in Hartford. He said the increases will help lift workers out of poverty, reduce pay disparities among races and genders, and stimulate the state’s economy. An estimated 130,000 workers are expected to benefit from the first increase planned for October, when the minimum wage will climb to $11 an hour. Opponents have argued the legislation will be another cost for employers.

Delaware

Wilmington: Wanting to remember the 360 Wilmingtonians killed in World War II, a city native has launched a website to ensure their ultimate sacrifices and achievements will never be taken for granted. A Tribute to Wilmington’s Greatest Generation names every resident killed during WWII and provides snippets explaining who they were before the war. The website also has newspaper clippings about the warriors, as well as what was going on in Wilmington at the time. “As we get further away from that period ... I kind of wanted to do something to keep that memory alive,” says Nathan Field, the website’s creator. The idea for the website developed as Field would see names on plaques honoring those who died in wars, but little else, and would wonder, “Who were they?”

Washington: The founding director of the Smithsonian’s museum about African American history will now lead the entire system of museums and parks. The Smithsonian Institution on Tuesday named Lonnie Bunch as its 14th secretary. Bunch was the first director of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. He’ll now lead the world’s largest museum, education and research complex, with 19 museums and the National Zoological Park. Bunch becomes the first African American to lead the Smithsonian, beginning his new position June 16. He’ll be replaced as interim director by Spencer Crew. Bunch was hired in 2005 and shepherded the collection of more than 40,000 items and the creation of the museum on the National Mall. It opened in 2016.

Florida

Naples: The Naples Zoo is celebrating the birth of three African lion cubs. The zoo announced the birth of the cubs – the institution’s first in 30 years – on Thursday; one was born May 13, and two were born May 14. The cubs and their mother, 13-year-old Shani, may be exhibited late this summer. The zoo says it will host a contest to name the cubs. It says zoo workers haven’t gotten close enough to the cubs to know their genders or weights, but the cubs are being monitored through video feeds. The International Union for Conservation of Nature classifies African lions as vulnerable to extinction. They’re endangered by illegal hunting, declining prey populations and habitat loss.

Georgia

Atlanta: More than a third of small towns in the state lost population in the past year, highlighting the challenges of reviving rural areas. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports new census estimates show that Camilla fell below 5,000 residents. Sparks fell below 2,000, Fort Gaines dropped below 1,000, and Milan fell to 661 residents, for a loss of 7% of its population. All four towns are in South Georgia. Meanwhile, Georgia’s cities are growing. Atlanta grew more than 1% in the past year and is now nearing the half-million-resident mark. The city now boasts 498,044 residents and will cross 500,000 next year if current growth rates continue. The trend is hardly a new one, but continued population losses have raised questions about whether rural areas can do anything to reverse the tide.

Hawaii

Honolulu: Big waves and high tides in the state will make shoreline erosion and flooding likely this summer. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports a University of Hawaii at Manoa geologist has predicted a “regional anomaly” is likely to produce tides 2-4 inches higher than levels noted on charts. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says there will be 36 days with peak high tides above 2.2 feet in June, July and August. Geologist Dolan Eversole, who works with the Waikiki Beach Special Improvement District, says the highest tide will be 2.6 feet on July 31. Eversole says that an anomaly involving cyclical high water levels and Pacific winds will cause levels higher than those predicted by NOAA and that, combined with big waves, these high tides make shoreline inundations and erosion likely.

Idaho

Caldwell: Twelve farm workers and ten others were treated at the West Valley Medical Center and decontaminated by a hazmat team Sunday night. KTVB-TV reports the Caldwell Fire Department said the workers were exposed to an unknown substance at a field near Wilder in eastern Idaho, and all began to experience flu-like symptoms. They then all went to the medical center for treatment. Caldwell Fire treated the first patient and then requested help by the State Office of Emergency Management, which sent the Region 3 Hazmat Team to help decontaminate the other patients. Officials did not release what the substance was to which the workers were exposed or why another ten people had to be treated and decontaminated at the hospital.

Illinois

Chicago: The University of Chicago says it will be the first U.S. university to create a school of molecular engineering, thanks to a $100 million donation. The university announced Tuesday that the new school will be known as the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, supported by a gift from the Pritzker Foundation. The university’s first school in engineering and its first new school in three decades will aim to find new solutions for pressing global challenges, including immunotherapy-based approaches to cancer and the search for sustainable energy. University of Chicago President Robert Zimmer says the gift will help expand work already underway with Argonne National Laboratory. The foundation is led by relatives of Gov. J.B. Pritzker, including former U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker.

Bunker Hill: The aircraft museum at northern Indiana’s Grissom Air Reserve Base is working to raise $300,000 toward a building to protect and display one of the few surviving Cold War-era B-58 Hustler bombers. Grissom Air Museum leaders plan an exhibit space resembling one of the huts that housed the bombers when they were stationed at the base in the 1960s. The B-58 was the U.S. Air Force’s first operational supersonic bomber. Museum Director Tom Jennings tells the Kokomo Tribune the B-58 is the museum’s crown jewel. The museum raised about $90,000 during a reunion of B-58 veterans and hopes to start construction later this year. Museum officials say nearly half of the 116-aircraft fleet was stationed at what is now Grissom, and only eight such planes remain.

Iowa

Ankeny: A food festival this weekend offers the chance ton enjoy pizza for seven solid hours. Ankeny’s fourth annual Pizza Fest is taking place from 4 to 11 p.m. Saturday at the new Town Square Park near The District in Ankeny’s Prairie Trail. Festivalgoers can taste pizza and other foods from area pizzerias, restaurants and food truck vendors. Domestic and local craft beers, wine and specialty cocktails will also be available along with games and live music. Admission is free. Pizza lovers can enter an eating contest, and vendors will be vying for votes to be named the Best of the Fest 2019. Attendees can try each food vendor’s entry for $1. Along with pizza, entries will include pizza corn dogs, pizza-dillas, pizza mac and cheese, pizza egg rolls and other tasty pizza creations.

Kansas

Wichita: Tiger and lion pelts seized from wildlife traffickers have been donated to zoos in Topeka and Wichita. U.S. Attorney Stephen McAllister said Friday that his office donated pelts that were seized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service during investigations of a black market for hides and other parts of protected wildlife. Many of the wildlife items forfeited or abandoned during federal investigations are donated to educational facilities and nonprofit organizations to teach about endangered species. Fish and Wildlife Service agents used some of the pelts in a sting operation in 2018 that resulted in a Wichita man pleading guilty and agreeing to pay $8,000 for two tiger pelts. Agents seized a lion pelt from his home.

Kentucky

Richmond: The destruction of chemical weapons stored in the state since the 1940s is set to begin. The Lexington Herald-Leader reports that destruction of chemical agents including mustard, sarin and VX will begin in June after decades of planning and preparations. The weapons are stored at the Blue Grass Army Depot in Richmond, and a company called Blue Grass Chemical Activity is responsible for their destruction. The Blue Grass Army Depot and Blue Grass Chemical Activity say about 1,200 workers are set to eliminate more than 100,000 chemical-filled munitions stored in earth-covered igloos by 2023. Project manager Ronk Hink says crews have spent about four years training and methodically testing equipment and processes to make sure the plant is prepared for the operation.

New Orleans: The French government has added a house in the city where the French painter Edgar Degas lived briefly to a network of houses of famous French people. Degas House Museum owner David Villarrubia says the bed and breakfast will be able to display a large red medallion showing it is part of the “Maisons des Illustres.” Degas visited relatives there for 4 1/ 2 months in 1872-73. Villarrubia says he was notified late last year and expects the medallion in July. He says the network includes 236 houses, but only four are outside of France and its territories, with only one other in the United States. France’s Ministry of Culture created the designation in 2011 to encourage people to visit homes representing French history and culture.

Maine

Augusta: The state is on track to come up with a plan to become a net exporter of energy by 2030. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills recently signed the bill into law as part of efforts to promote renewable energy. Democratic Rep. Brian Hubbell has said renewable energy such as hydropower, wind and biomass already makes up 36% of Maine’s total energy usage. Federal data shows imported carbon fuels produce 90 of the 120 terawatt-hours of energy that Maine consumes each year. The legislation directs the Governor’s Energy Office to analyze how the state can become a net exporter of energy by 2030. The state could do that by developing and expanding its energy generating capacity, energy conservation and energy efficiency efforts at a level to offset Maine’s domestic energy consumption.

Maryland

Annapolis: The speaker of the House of Delegates has called for the removal of a Statehouse plaque that honors the Civil War’s Union and Confederate soldiers. Speaker Adrienne A. Jones said last week that the plaque “sympathizes with Confederate motivations and memorializes Confederate soldiers.” The Democrat shared her concerns in a letter to the State House Trust, which oversees alterations to the Capitol building. The Baltimore Sun reports that the plaque features the American flag and the Confederate flag crossed over the words, “Maryland Remembers.” The plaque says its purpose is to ensure that Maryland remembers the “nearly 63,000 native sons who served in the Union forces and the more than 22,000 in those of the Confederacy.” Jones sits on the State House Trust, which would need to approve the plaque’s removal.

Massachusetts

Brookline: The National Park Service is marking two Kennedy milestones this week. On Wednesday, events are planned to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the opening of the John Fitzgerald Kennedy National Historic Site at JFK’s boyhood home in Brookline. That same day would have been the slain president’s 102nd birthday. Organizers say a special commemoration will be held starting at 10 a.m. with the theme, “What JFK means to me.” At 2 p.m., presidential biographers Fredrik Logevall, David Nasaw and Barbara Perry will participate in a panel discussion examining the legacy of the nation’s 35th president. The park service leads tours of the house where the Kennedy family began its rise to national prominence. Kennedy was assassinated Nov. 22, 1963.

Michigan

Grand Rapids: Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park in western Michigan has opened a new attraction – on the roof. The Stuart and Barbara Padnos Rooftop Sculpture Garden is located atop the recently completed 22,000-square-foot Covenant Learning Center. The rooftop garden is part of the $115 million “Welcoming the World: Honoring a Legacy of Love” expansion project. It’s designed to enhance the mission of the Grand Rapids-area attraction of promoting an appreciation for gardens, sculpture, the natural environment and the arts. The rooftop garden offers a habitat for birds, butterflies and insects. It has four long-term loans from the Smithsonian’s Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington.

Minnesota

St. Paul: Residents may believe this past winter was rough, but state health officials say it wasn’t bad enough to kill off the deer ticks that carry Lyme disease. Dave Neitzel, an epidemiologist with the Minnesota Department of Health, told Minneapolis Public Radio that the cold kills ticks only if the insects are exposed to the air. He says the ticks mostly survived the harsh cold by staying insulated under a thick blanket of snow. Early results from health department field surveys indicate there are more deer ticks now compared to this time last year. Deer ticks carry Lyme disease, which causes fever and fatigue, joint damage and, if left untreated, heart and neurological problems. Neitzel urges outdoor enthusiasts to protect themselves with repellents containing DEET or permethrin.

Mississippi

Tupelo: The National Park Service is considering dismantling some historic buildings in the state because nobody has been willing to lease or restore them. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports the nine cottages and two outbuildings are in the Tupelo Homestead Historic District. Built in 1936 by the Resettlement Administration and transferred to the National Park Service in 1940, they are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Four years ago, Natchez Trace Parkway officials tried to gauge public and private interest in preserving some of the cottages that sit near its headquarters. Last year, the parkway sought proposals but received none. A news release says the parkway cannot afford to maintain the buildings. The colony of cottages originally had 35 homesteads.

Missouri

St. Louis: The St. Louis Zoo is planning an $11.5 million expansion of its area for primates, adding 35,000 square feet of outdoor space that will include trails and tunnels for observers to get a close-up view. Monkeys, chimps and their cousins have long been among the most popular of the 17,000 animals at the zoo, even if the Primate House where they live is aging. Curator of primates Heidi Hellmuth says the new Primate Canopy Trails, expected to open in 2021, allows the animals to spend much of their time outside. Meanwhile, visitors will be able to get remarkably close. Those entering the primate area will walk through a ground-level glass tunnel. Overhead mesh tunnels between existing sycamore trees will let people observe the animals as they move and play.

Montana

Anaconda: The state’s congressional delegation is protesting the planned closure of an Anaconda Job Corps center by the U.S. Department of Labor. The Montana Standard reports that the Anaconda Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center will close in August. The center opened in 1966 and provides training in manufacturing, mechanics, carpentry and other disciplines. The department says it plans to close nine centers across the country to better serve students at higher-performing centers. Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, Republican U.S. Sen. Steve Daines and GOP Rep. Greg Gianforte are urging Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta to reconsider the decision. Bill Everett, the Anaconda center’s CEO, says it’s one of Anaconda’s biggest employers and keeps many youth out of trouble by providing them with vital job skills and employment opportunities.

Nebraska

Omaha: Just as summer is finally coming into view, a local museum is kicking off its search for the perfect Christmas tree. The Durham Museum is searching for the official tree for its annual Christmas at Union Station celebration. Every year, the museum receives submissions from Omaha-area residents offering to donate their evergreen tree for display. The tree selected must meet certain benchmarks, including that it be over 40 feet tall, have a single, straight trunk, have a uniform shape and be in a spot where it can be safely removed. This year’s tree will be cut down on Nov. 18, and a tree-lighting ceremony is set for Nov. 29. Residents wishing to donate an evergreen tree may contact The Durham at 402-444-5071 before Aug. 1.

Nevada

Baker: A 137-year-old rifle found five years ago leaning against a juniper tree in Great Basin National Park is now part of an exhibit dedicated to the “Forgotten Winchester” at the park visitor center, in Nevada near the Utah border. The weathered Winchester Model 1873 is in a case designed to capture the way it looked when park archaeologist Eva Jensen stumbled across it on a rocky outcrop above Strawberry Creek during an archaeological survey. Based on its condition, experts believe the weapon might have been abandoned in the forest more than a century ago. But nearly five years after its discovery, park officials still don’t know to whom it belonged or why it was left against the tree. The exhibit also highlights the role the Model 1873 – one of the most popular guns on the Western frontier – played in the history of the West.

New Hampshire

Concord: The state’s Fish and Game Department is reminding people not to interfere if they see fawns by themselves. The majority of deer fawns are born in May and June. People may see fawns alone and try to help them, but the doe usually isn’t far off, waiting to return to feed her newborn offspring. The department says adult deer can be easily detected by predators, due to their scent and size. Does will spend extended periods away from their fawns to disassociate their scent from the fawn and keep them safe from predators. People who try to help usually are removing fawns from the mother’s care. Improper care of injured or orphaned wildlife often leads to animals’ sickness or death. People can call in a report if there’s a concern.

New Jersey

Trenton: Several months after a false start, the state has issued new rules for microbreweries. The guidelines released Tuesday cover how many events breweries can host, who is allowed to drink on-premises and whether they can serve food. Last fall, the state issued rules that prompted opposition from some microbrewery owners who said they would hurt business, so the state’s Division of Alcohol and Beverage Control decided to suspend the process and do more study. The guidelines are updates to a 2012 law that allowed breweries to serve their products on-site. Bar and restaurant owners have voiced concern that the breweries are diluting the value of their liquor licenses, which are limited in number and can cost well into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

New Mexico

Shiprock: Ranchers in northwestern New Mexico suspect toxic plants are responsible for the recent deaths of more than a dozen cows. The Gallup Independent reports at least 15 cows from different herds in the Shiprock area have died of a mysterious illness in the past three weeks. And ranchers say the purple plant known as the tall mountain larkspur is the likely cause. The plant is growing in abundance on the range thanks to unusually wet weather. It is used in Navajo and Hopi religious ceremonies and as after-birth wash. Navajo botanist and geologist Arnold Clifford says the plant is toxic to cows because of its high concentrations of alkaloid. He says because the Shiprock range is nearly devoid of forage, cattle tend to supplement their diet with any plant species just to fill their stomachs.

New York: Three years after graduation, the “dorm chef” is still cooking up culinary buzz. Jonah Reider became a media sensation as a Columbia University senior booted from his dorm for running a sophisticated supper club there. His club, Pith, now has a new incarnation in a high-rise apartment near Wall Street. Reider flew overseas this spring to make a pilot for Japanese television. And he’s planning a grilled cheese sandwich shop in Tokyo. He’s also launched a company that sells honey, salt and olive oil infused with CBD nationally, as well as with THC in Oregon. Despite all that, Reider says he doesn’t want to be known as a chef. He tells the Associated Press he’s trying to inspire people to cook at home for friends and family rather than overspending at restaurants.

North Carolina

Raleigh: Every time 28-year-old Poet Williams applies for a job, his arrest record comes up: three nonviolent misdemeanors. Those drug charges have followed the Durham resident since he was 21, barring him from jobs, apartments and opportunities. Soon, however, he may be able to remove those offenses from his record. The state Senate recently passed legislation loosening the requirements to expunge a criminal record. Offenders could wipe out multiple nonviolent misdemeanor or low-level felony convictions, regardless of age, and the bill expands expunctions for misdemeanors and minor felonies committed by 16- and 17-year olds. Currently, only nonviolent, first-time convictions qualify. Crimes that require sex offense registration and traffic infractions couldn’t be expunged. “The Second Chance Act” measure now goes to the House, where organizers say it stands a good chance of passing.

North Dakota

Bismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum’s office says nearly 70 people have applied to serve on a panel that’s seen as key to implementing a voter-approved constitutional amendment aimed at government ethics reform. Those who submitted applications by Friday’s deadline include several former lawmakers, lobbyists, farmers, tribal members, a Boy Scout leader and a newspaper editor. The Republican-led Legislature was successful in pushing its own bill aimed at ethics reform to meet the requirements of the constitutional amendment. But it wasn’t what Democrats and others who pushed for the ethics reform wanted. The constitutional amendment still allows the new commission to write its own rules for ethics reform. The governor, as well as Senate majority and minority leaders, must agree by consensus on who sits on the panel, which is expected to be chosen by July 1.

Columbus: The First Amendment right to free speech is no laughing matter, as illustrated by a new exhibit at the world’s largest cartoon library, Ohio State University’s Bille Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum. The political cartooning display runs the gamut from a 1774 etching by Paul Revere criticizing Britain’s use of tea as a political weapon to a 2018 cartoon lampooning the blocking of online conservative commentary. Other cartoons take on political correctness, flag desecration, fake news, campus conduct codes and the role of Twitter in public discourse. Museum founder Lucy Caswell co-curated the exhibit with Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes. “Front Line: Editorial Cartoonists and the First Amendment” runs through October.

Oklahoma

Oklahoma City: The state attorney general’s office says the state Supreme Court should reject a proposed petition to expand Medicaid because the summary contradicts the body of the petition concerning income eligibility for the public health insurance program. The petition was filed on behalf of two residents in April. It would modify Oklahoma’s constitution to extend the federal-state health insurance program to eligible low-income adults. The Oklahoman reports that the attorney general’s office said in a court briefing Thursday that the proposed petition is otherwise constitutional. The petition’s supporters also filed a brief with the court Thursday insisting that the Supreme Court maintain the petition’s language and its constitutionality. The Oklahoma Supreme Court is slated to hear the case’s oral arguments June 18.

Salem: One of the state’s most popular wilderness trails will remain closed into the beginning of this summer, almost two years after a large wildfire closed it down in the Mount Jefferson Wilderness. The Whitewater Trail, the most common route to the popular backcountry campsites of Jefferson Park, had its closure order extended into August, the U.S. Forest Service said last week. The trail was heavily damaged by the Whitewater Fire that burned in July 2017. Crews worked last summer and fall to fix the trail, but more trees died over the winter and spring, leaving a mess on the road and at the trailhead. Detroit district ranger David Halemeier says crews need additional time to clean out the area before reopening it to the public.

Pittsburgh: A local theater company is bringing Shakespeare to the site of a once-mighty steel company’s blast furnace. Quantum Theatre is using the backdrop of the Carrie Furnace for its production of “King Lear,” the bard’s darkest tragedy. It tells of grief and madness, family values gone wrong and a powerful king brought low. The theater company’s artistic director and founder says being at the site gives a sense of the enormity of the steel industry and the enormity of its collapse. Karla Boos says those are wonderful metaphors for “King Lear.” The Carrie Furnaces are the last remaining structures of what was once the thrumming heart of the Homestead Steel Works. The company produced steel used in the Empire State Building, the Brooklyn Bridge and other iconic structures. The play runs through Sunday.

Rhode Island

Providence: Many items in the state archives, including Rhode Island’s copy of the Bill of Rights, are at risk of damage because they’re kept in a building that’s not meant for preserving rare, historic documents, according to an assessment released Tuesday. There isn’t enough space to store or exhibit them properly, and water, light, dust and atmospheric pollution pose a risk to many of the items, according to the report by the Northeast Document Conservation Center. The collection has been housed since 1990 in a rented office building in a flood zone in downtown Providence. An estimated 35% of the collection should be considered a high priority for conservation, the center found. That includes the draft of the Bill of Rights sent to Rhode Island for its consideration, a map of the Revolutionary War Battle of Rhode Island and a printing of the Declaration of Independence from 1823.

South Carolina

Sullivans Island: The extreme heat that’s been scorching the Deep South prompted the closure of a swinging bridge to a beach town for several hours. The state Department of Transportation says the heat caused the steel in the Ben Sawyer Bridge to Sullivans Island to expand, preventing the bridge from fully closing after it was opened Monday. The DOT said on Twitter that crews cooled the steel with water from a firetruck, then locked the bridge once it could close. Transportation officials say they will keep the bridge locked until they can fix the steel, giving it more room to expand. The closing left only one way on and off Sullivans Island and the Isle of Palms at the end of the Memorial Day weekend. The high Sunday and Monday in Charleston was 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

South Dakota

Brookings: A Brookings High School student has captured the first-place award in an international science competition for his project aimed at fighting the opioid epidemic. Fourteen-year-old Aditya Tummala developed a gummy-like substance, similar to a gummy bear, that would make an opioid pill tamper-proof, meaning the medication couldn’t be crushed or melted for snorting or injecting. KSFY-TV says the project garnered first place at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in Phoenix, Arizona. Tummala calls the product Tampr-X.

Memphis: Back in 1993, when Eric Friedl decided to start the Goner Records label – putting out a limited vinyl release from Japanese noise-rockers Guitar Wolf – he did it because “their music was so wild that I didn’t think there was a label that would dare release anything by them.” Back then, Friedl couldn’t have expected Goner would be going, bigger and better than ever, 25 years on. But in 2019, Goner is its own little empire: one that includes a still-flourishing label, a thriving retail store and the annual Gonerfest concert extravaganza, which draws bands and fans from all over the world each September. To mark Goner’s silver anniversary, the company is throwing a party this weekend. Goner25 is a three-day bash that will include a performance by Guitar Wolf and other longtime label acts and supporters like The 5.6.7.8’s, Royal Pendletons, Jack Oblivian and Bloodshot Bill, plus film screenings and other fun.

Texas

Houston: A new study says housing sales in the state would decline, gasoline prices would spike and the state’s economic output would drop by hundreds of billions of dollars if another major storm struck an unprotected coastline. The joint economic impact study by Texas A&M University at Galveston and the Texas General Land Office evaluated storm surge impacts on the three counties along Galveston Bay – Galveston, Harris and Chambers. The Houston Chronicle reports it also examined how flooding from a major storm would affect local and national economies. Hurricane Harvey swamped the area in August 2017, making landfall near Corpus Christi with 130 mph sustained winds and torrential rains. The study was conducted before the Army Corps of Engineers’ October proposal for a 74-mile barrier to avert future hurricanes.

Utah

Salt Lake City: Becoming one of the 10 approved medical marijuana growers in the state’s new program won’t be cheap. The Salt Lake Tribune reports the state plans to charge a $10,000 application fee and an additional $100,000 annual licensing fee for those chosen, according to draft rules for Utah’s new medical marijuana program published last week. State officials say the license fees are meant to offset the expense of adding personnel and equipment to inspect the growing facilities. If all 10 grower licenses are granted, revenues to the agriculture department could top $1.1 million the first year and hover around $1 million over the following years as cultivators pay the renewal fee. The state’s agricultural department expects to spend more than $560,000 each year to oversee cannabis cultivation and plant sales.

Vermont

Montpelier: The annual survey of homelessness in the state says the number of people who were homeless on one night in January was down 15.5% from last year. The 2019 Point-in-Time Count Report was released this month by the Vermont Coalition to End Homelessness and the Chittenden County Homeless Alliance. The survey, which was conducted Jan. 23, found that 1,089 Vermonters were homeless that day. That represented a decrease of 202 people from the 2018 count. The Point-in-Time Count allows local communities and state policy makers to understand the current problems of homelessness, target limited funding to appropriate housing and services, and track progress in reducing homelessness. Among other findings, the survey determined that 245 homeless people were under age 18, the same percentage as 2018.

Virginia

Virginia Beach: Inflatable rafts, trashed awnings, red cups and towels amounted to 10 tons of garbage left on the shore at Chic’s Beach following a Memorial Day weekend event. Floatopia, a massive start-of-summer party at Chic’s Beach, drew hundreds of people Sunday for a day of drinking and lounging in the Chesapeake Bay, WCNC-TV reports, but photos of the messy aftermath spread quickly online. A crew of only nine people arrived Monday morning to clean up the 20,000-pound mess, Virginia Beach Public Works spokesman Drew Lankford said. “It was food wrappers, cans, bottles, pieces of floats, towels, everything,” he told WCNC-TV. Lankford told WCNC-TV that Floatopia is organized largely on social media, making communication with the event’s organizers difficult.

Washington

Mount Vernon: Wildfire responders in western Washington are preparing for a particularly bad wildfire season. With less precipitation than normal so far in 2019 and snowpack in the North Cascades depleting rapidly, conditions are already abnormally dry, and much of the western side of the state has been declared in or at risk of drought. “It’s going to be a dry summer, and any outdoor burns are going to be risky,” Skagit County Deputy Fire Marshal Mark Anderson told the Skagit Valley Herald. “We saw that in March.” During that unusually dry month, 21 outdoor burns in the county got out of control. Deputy Fire Marshal Bonnie LaCount said the largest escalated into a 21-acre fire in the Rockport area. The second largest was a 5-acre, wind-driven fire in Clear Lake.

Bluefield: A Korean War-era tank near the entrance to a local park turned bright lemon-lime yellow thanks to a mix-up with paint colors. The Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports city officials were initially unable to explain the color change. Then the sponsor of a Bluefield State College science fiction club sent a letter to the paper. Jerry Conner said the U.S.S. Yeager Chapter of Starfleet International has been cleaning and painting the tank for about 20 years. “We took a sample of the color to a Bluefield merchant and purchased two gallons which was supposed to match our sample,” Conner said in the letter. “We were worried when we opened the containers and found something nowhere near our sample.” Club members assumed the paint would turn olive drab once it dried, Conner said. It didn’t.

Wisconsin

Madison: The state might be best known for its beer offerings, but its wineries are drawing tourists from across the Upper Midwest. Wisconsin Public Radio reports that a Michigan State University study estimated 1.78 million visits were made to Wisconsin’s winery tasting rooms in 2015, bringing in nearly $50 million in wine tourism. The study’s author, Dan McCole, is an associate professor of tourism and sustainability at Michigan State University. McCole found that most people don’t visit Wisconsin’s wineries to learn about wine but rather for leisure, such as family gatherings. He says the state’s wineries are easy to get to from bigger cities, and Wisconsin doesn’t need to produce the highest-quality wines. He says visitors are looking for a good experience.

Yellowstone National Park: A federal report shows visitors to Yellowstone National Park spent nearly $513 million in neighboring communities last year. The report last week from the National Park Service indicates the spending by the park’s 4.1 million visitors supported nearly 7,100 jobs in the area in 2018. According to the report, the more than 468,000 visitors to Devils Tower National Monument in northeast Wyoming spent $30 million last year, supporting more than 400 jobs. The park service recorded more than 318 million visitors nationwide. The report shows they spent more than $20 billion in communities within 60 miles of parks to support 329,000 jobs. Of the nationwide visitor spending, nearly $7 billion was on lodging expenses and $4 billion on restaurants and bars.

"Republican Greg Gianforte speaks to a member of the audience after debating Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, not seen, in Big Sky, Mont., Sunday, June 26, 2016. AP Photo/Bobby Caina Calvan The Democratic governor of Montana accused Republican Greg Gianforte of lying on Thursday, as news of Gianforte`s attack on a journalist threatens to derail his campaign in a special election a congressional seat.

""It is unsettling on many levels that Greg Gianforte physically assaulted a journalist and then lied, refusing to take responsibility for his actions,"" Montana Gov. Steve Bullock said in a statement posted to Facebook.

""Yesterday`s events serve as another wake up call to all Montanans and Americans that we must restore civility in politics and governing, and demand more from people who hold the public`s trust.""

Gianforte was cited for misdemeanor assault on Wednesday after allegedly slamming The Guardian`s Ben Jacobs to the ground and punching him during a campaign rally in Bozeman. Audio of the incident, as well as an eyewitness account from a Fox News crew in the room, suggested no physical aggression on Jacobs`s part before the alleged assault.

But Gianforte`s campaign spun the incident differently, arguing in a statement that Jacobs himself was to blame:

""Jacobs grabbed Greg`s wrist, and spun away from Greg, pushing them both to the ground,"" the statement read. ""It`s unfortunate that this aggressive behavior from a liberal journalist created this scene at our campaign volunteer BBQ.""

The incident began after Jacobs pressed Gianforte for comment on the Congressional Budget Office`s recently released evaluation of the American Health Care Act. It occurred a day before Montanans vote on whether Gianforte or his Democratic opponent Rob Quist will fill a congressional seat vacated when President Donald Trump tapped former Rep. Ryan Zinke to be his interior secretary. Polls close at 8 p.m. local time Thursday.

Steve Bullock Matt Volz/AP With more than a third of ballots having been cast during early voting, it is unclear what kind of effect the incident will have on Gianforte`s chances on Thursday — something Bullock acknowledged in his statement.

""One thing is clear,"" he said. ""No matter what happens today, the actions of Gianforte do not reflect the values of Montana or its people.""

Bullock defeated Gianforte by 20,000 votes last year in Montana`s gubernatorial election.

Bullock isn`t the only prominent state Democrat to blast Gianforte on Thursday — he was joined by Montana`s Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.

""Part of the job representing the people of Montana is answering basic questions on important topics, topics such as how a dangerous healthcare plan could impact the very people you are trying to represent. It`s part of the job,"" Tester said in a statement.", Montana governor: It`s `unsettling on many levels` that candidate for GOP House seat lied about assaulting reporter ,5-2019

CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa – John Mertz, a retired state employee in a small and shrinking city, appreciated it when Amy Klobuchar stopped by for a town hall. On Friday, he stood at the back of a microbrewery to hear Beto O`Rourke make a pitch and take questions. Neither of them made him a believer, but they tried, and he had begun to wonder about the candidates who weren`t coming to Knoxville.

""Joe Biden`s quiet,"" said Mertz, 72. ""You don`t hear much about where he`s at or what he`s doing. I understand that there`s 19 of the Democrats going to Cedar Rapids, but not him, and that`s odd to me.""

Biden, who will return to Iowa on Tuesday, has been less visible in the state than most of his competitors. In late April, he told audiences that they`d be ""seeing a lot of him."" In the last month, he didn`t visit the state at all; on Saturday, a Des Moines Register poll that has unusual power to set narratives showed his lead over the field slipping, with just 24 percent of potential caucus-goers picking him as their first choice.

The former vice president`s rivals have used that time to build up campaign operations in Iowa, banking on the state`s voters to reward the candidates they see and hear the most. While Biden`s campaign is ramping up — it will have 50 staff in the state by the end of June — the candidate will have skipped a party convention in California and an Iowa Hall of Fame dinner in Cedar Rapids, which bustled with rival Democrats and their supporters, taking every chance to get in front of voters.

""Joe Biden has a long history here,"" said former governor and agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack. ""He doesn`t need to introduce himself to Iowans like a lot of candidates do.""

As Vilsack said that, he was standing in the lobby of the Cedar Rapids convention center, where supporters of Democrats such as Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar waved signs, banged glowing ""thundersticks"" and inserted their candidate`s names into old protest chants.

""There`s still plenty of time,"" Vilsack said, ""despite all of this.""

Biden had reasons for missing the Iowa gala, telling state Democratic chairman Troy Price that he was at a family event he would ""postpone an inauguration for."" (It was his granddaughter`s high school graduation.) He would be coming back to Iowa two days later, and his campaign said that it was building, quietly, earlier than many previous Iowa operations. Voters who attended Biden`s first four events in the state, or RSVP`d for them, had gotten calls informing them of how they could help; the campaign had organized live-stream house parties on May 18, when Biden gave his extended launch speech in Philadelphia.

A Biden campaign operative argued that the flashy, early organizing of some other campaigns came with risks candidates didn`t want to admit. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren`s campaign, which has the largest Iowa staff, spent around 87 cents for every dollar it raised from January through March. Former Maryland congressman John Delaney, who has opened eight offices in the state, has not moved up in polls or noticeably grown his crowds.

""We`re probably good with offices in Iowa,"" Delaney said in an interview.

And former Texas congressman O`Rourke, who adapted the ""distributed organizing"" of the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign for his Senate race in Texas, has dipped in polling of Iowa after holding 15 town halls and about as many meet-and-greets, more than any other candidate who declared this year.

""This is the only way I know to learn what`s most important to the people of Iowa,"" O`Rourke explained after his Knoxville town hall. ""It`s to show up and listen to them; and not just the questions that get asked publicly, but in line, folks will say, `Hey you know, on your answer about this, have you thought about taking this additional step?` We`re writing down everything everyone tells us, and then incorporating that, as long as I agree with it, into the plans that we`re proposing for the country.""

The record of candidate time in Iowa translating to votes in the caucuses is decidedly mixed. Ahead of the 2004 contest, John Edwards visited all 99 counties and surged to a second-place finish that helped him secure the party`s vice presidential nomination. Four years later, Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut moved to the state, putting his young children in local schools; he ran sixth in a field of eight candidates, then quit the race. Marianne Williamson, a self-help author, has moved to the state; in an interview, she downplayed what it meant for her campaign or for the media`s expectation.

""My lease was up in New York,"" she said. ""I`ve been living out of a suitcase!""

It`s in the interest of most candidates, however, to play up their own Iowa work and draw attention to what the leader in the polls isn`t doing. After a Saturday morning house party in Des Moines, Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Ind., mayor, declined to talk about Biden but explained just how much he was getting from spending time in the state.

""The way the voters here really take seriously their responsibility and their position to evaluate who the next nominee and next president is going to be,"" Buttigieg said. ""It just makes it a great place to campaign and you`ll be seeing us here very often.""

Some Iowa Democrats, who have not seen this level of individual candidate organizing in a lifetime, want to prove that candidates must work the state and answer questions, or there will be setbacks.

""I call [Biden] the `leader,` with air quotes,"" said 2018 congressional candidate J.D. Scholten, whose narrow loss to Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) won him a following. ""He hasn`t been to western Iowa yet, and I know we have questions to ask him.""

On Sunday, as Democrats took the Cedar Rapids stage without Biden, there was no evidence of his Iowa operation in sight. But there was not much evidence that rank-and-file Democrats wanted to punish him. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who had come into the state a day early to hold rallies and marched to the convention center with fast food workers, used some of his time onstage to attack ""a middle ground strategy that antagonizes no one, that stands up to nobody, and that changes nothing.”

It was clear that he was referring to Biden; it was hard to hear much applause.

It`s easy to describe the Democratic primaries in two ways: Joe Biden is running ahead, helped by the pileup of candidates behind him. Last night`s benchmark poll clarified both story lines. First: The vast majority of Democratic candidates are nowhere close to becoming viable in Iowa. (""Viability"" means getting 15 percent or more in a caucus room.) Second: Biden is running behind previous ""front-runners"" at this point in previous cycles. At a similar point in 2007, John Edwards led the Iowa field with 29 percent support; Hillary Clinton led with 57 percent. And that`s why so many candidates continue to see a path past Biden.

But at this moment, it`s really Warren who shows the most room to grow in the state, with Harris not far behind. Warren now has the highest net favorable rating among Democratic voters; she and Harris are the second choice of the most voters, each getting 14 percent of them. Cory Booker is being ""actively considered"" by the most voters, 36 percent, but Harris and Warren are close behind; 32 percent of voters say they`re at least considering support for them. Also in the ""actively considering"" club: Beto O`Rourke, who despite tumbling as a ""first choice"" is still being considered by 33 percent of voters.

No campaign thinks the June 2019 polling fully captures what will happen in February 2020. But it does suggest that some campaigns have been effective over the past few months, and some haven`t. Sanders, who started his campaign seven weeks after Warren`s, is only now catching up in on-the-ground staff, but his universe of supporters is shrinking; he`s pulling just one third of the support he got in the 2016 caucuses.

ON THE TRAIL

DES MOINES — On Saturday afternoon, while half of the Democratic presidential contenders fanned out across Iowa, 600 voters packed a high school auditorium to hear from a candidate who`d already dropped out. Richard Ojeda, a former West Virginia legislator whose White House run lasted just 75 days, thundered that any Democrat worthy of the presidency would back ""free college for all of our students"" and ""make the top one percent finally pay"" higher taxes.

""We need candidates who will do just that!"" Ojeda said. ""If they won`t do that just, kick `em off your porch!""

The crowd at the ""Revolution Rally,"" organized by the liberal news network The Young Turks, cheered, and waved signs — ""HIGHER WAGES,"" ""GREEN NEW DEAL"" — in the network`s yellow and black colors. Ojeda was there to launch the ""TYT Army,"" the latest and loudest organization dedicated to pressuring candidates into taking hard stands on issues.

""We want to clarify what the `progressive` position is, because it feels like the media is calling everybody a progressive,"" Cenk Uygur, the network`s founder and main host, said in an interview before the rally. ""So, the TYT Army is going to find the candidates, and ask them questions, and keep asking them, and asking them.""

Presidential candidates, who spend the months before the first primary contests taking questions from voters, have made their peace with pressure groups. They see them every cycle, in different guises, from the Moms Demand Action questioners who show up in their red and white shirts, to the ""bird-dogging"" climate activists who will use their time in a rope or photo line to flip open a phone and record as they ask about getting off of fossil fuels.

The pressure group electorate had been moving left already; the ACLU`s ""rights voters,"" who sign up to learn how to approach candidates and ask the meatiest policy questions, have gotten Bernie Sanders to endorse voting rights for prisoners, and gotten Joe Biden to (eventually) abandon a ban on federal money paying for abortion.

But TYT, with its 6 million subscribers, has a particularly active and left-wing audience. Uygur, who co-founded Justice Democrats two years ago, set out to replace ""corporate Democrats"" with like-minded ""progressives."" Just 18 months later, Justice Democrats helped elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which undeniably changed the party and its internal debate, an achievement Uygur feels that the left does not get enough credit for.

""If Breitbart elected a member of Congress, you would never stop hearing about it,"" he said.

TYT has launched a few other projects designed to put 2020 Democrats on the record, starting with an occasional interview series where the candidates are grilled on their commitments. The goal of the new army is to get straight answers, yes or no, on the ""progressive economic pledge,"" an agenda TYT sketched out after consulting with some like-minded members of Congress. Ocasio-Cortez was one of the initial endorsers; the presidential candidates were next.

The five-plank pledge syncs up with the agenda of Sanders`s campaign, though some of his rivals have endorsed parts of it. To get right with the TYT Army, a candidate must commit to a constitutional amendment ""banning the private financing of elections,"" free college tuition, Medicare-for-all, the Green New Deal, and a worker`s agenda that includes a $15 minimum wage and an expansion of labor rights.

""If you get elected and you don`t fight for these things, we`re going to be all over for you,"" Uygur said. ""If Elizabeth Warren gets elected and says, `well, I like Medicare-for-all, but Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer say we can only get a public option,` then, okay: We`re going to surround the White House.""

On Sunday, Uygur began to test the pledge in the field. He roamed the convention center in Cedar Rapids, with a camera crew, asking the candidates he could find whether they would sign the pledge. John Delaney went point by point, saying where he disagreed. Jay Inslee told Uygur that he would be handling press questions later in the day.

At a small rally outside the convention center, Uygur spoke to dozens of activists in new TYT Army shirts, urging them to get in the potential presidents` faces. Within a few hours, three candidates — Sanders, Marianne Williamson, and an absent Mike Gravel — had signed the pledge.

""They`re going to hear a lot from us!"" he said.

2020

Bernie Sanders. He`s giving the first major speech of his campaign on Wednesday, discussing why ""democratic socialism is the only way to defeat oligarchy and authoritarianism"" at George Washington University. It is likely to expand on several previous speeches he`s given about combatting right-wing nationalism, but could also echo the November 2015 speech he gave on ""democratic socialism"" at Georgetown.

Steve Bullock. He was officially endorsed by Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), who had publicly held out some hope that the Montana governor would run for Senate.

Amy Klobuchar. She was endorsed by two Iowa legislators this week, the latest sign of how the establishment in the state is scattering between several contenders.

DEMS IN DISARRAY

Two years ago, after a long run at the Huffington Post, Ryan Grim took over the Washington bureau of the Intercept, the news site that launched with exclusive coverage of Edward Snowden`s archives of NSA material. Grim`s shop began covering the battles inside the Democratic Party closely, and with an angle; the party`s establishment was broken, and candidates who turned down big money were trying to fix it.

This week, Grim published ""We`ve Got People,"" a history of the party`s grass-roots movements and the forces that usually defeated it, personified by former Chicago Mayor and former congressman and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chief Rahm Emanuel. Grim talked to The Trailer about the book this week; a lightly edited transcript follows

The Trailer: How long have you been writing this book?

Ryan Grim: [HuffPost reporter] Arthur Delaney and I actually were kicking around a book like this in the spring of 2010 as the Affordable Care Act was wrapping up, and we outlined what it would look like. But we eventually concluded it just wasn`t there yet. My take was that there wasn`t really a protagonist for the story yet. You couldn`t really wrap it around [former Rep.] Lynn Woolsey, and Elizabeth Warren was still a law professor.

But I kept taking notes on the idea over the next decade. I was on the train coming back from the Bronx on June 27, from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez`s victory party, when it clicked. It was like: Oh, people care now! The Sanders campaign brought a ton of people in to the process. Then Trump winning brought another several million people from casual observers to fanatic activists. And then Ocasio-Cortez showed that Sanders was not a one-off phenomenon.

TT: There`s a lot of contemporary reporting here, and a lot of history. What did you learn that you didn`t know before digging in?

RG: I wasn`t quite as familiar with Jesse Jackson`s 1988 campaign. I had vaguely heard of the Michigan upset; I didn`t realize the depth of the panic that it set off, when Jesse beat Michael Dukakis. But the story started before that, with the Chicago machine establishment`s reaction to Harold Washington winning the Democratic primary for mayor in 1983. I didn`t realize that the party flipped like it did; Washington wins the 1983 primary and the machine does what the left always fears and warns that the machine is going to do: They literally switched sides and supported the Republican in the general election.

So in Chicago, then and now an almost universally Democratic city, Washington wins by four points in the general election. The police chief worked against him and so did all of the bosses of the machine including [the late Rep.] Dan Rostenkowski, who was literally Harold Washington`s congressional colleague. That, to me, was stunning, and that launched Jesse Jackson`s campaign; Jesse worked closely with Washington and when he saw the party establishment fighting against him, he decided that they needed to fight back in a more insurgent way.

TT: What was something you learned, from your research, is widely believed by Democrats but not really true?

RG: The 2006 midterms. Having covered them and having thought about them since then, I`ve always thought that Rahm`s celebration of himself was overblown. But looking at it race by race I was I was surprised at just how overblown it was. He pulled off such a PR magic trick with it that when I went back, every data point just kept backing up the idea that he was wrong; he insisted that progressive candidates couldn`t win and they did. [As chairman of the Democratic congressional committee] He pulled money out of races where they won the primaries, and the Republicans lost.

TT: Did you identify some moment or pivot point when the left blew it, where if some different decisions had been made it wouldn`t have lost its power in the party?

RG: You had this moment, after Watergate. The party is fired up, party activists are fired up, and the country is thoroughly rejecting Republicans. And so that is one reason you get so many candidates running in 1976 is that they all recognize the same thing that the Democrats recognize about 2020: They have a very good shot at being elected president. So as a result you get this flood of candidates, and Jimmy Carter squeaks through, and instead of delivering the kind of agenda that might have been possible, like card check, they go into this frenzy of deregulation. Had Democrats acted differently, you could have avoided the whole Reagan revolution.

The more recent example is that the Obama decision not to mobilize his base, and to pass a stimulus that was too small. What if he said, look, this is the stimulus that we need right now, I`m putting it on the floor: Go ahead, I dare you to vote it down. Let the Dow drop a thousand points and then we`re putting it back on the floor next week. Instead he said, `Well, [Obama economic chief] Larry Summers says we can`t get more than $700 billion so we`re just going to have to live with 10 percent unemployment for the next several years,` which not just produces an intense amount of pain around the country but basically helps launch the rise of authoritarianism here and abroad.

TT: You write a lot about the organizing techniques of the Sanders campaign, but the campaign lost. How effective are those tactics, really, and what are they?

RG: The best quote on that was from [Sanders`s 2016 digital organizing director] Claire Sandberg, saying that by the time we had built the airplane we had run out of runway. And that`s kind of a key point to understand. By the time they ended up having 200 million texts to voters, or whatever, 90 percent of those were after Iowa. They didn`t really get their operation up and running late January, February. The example to look at is Beto; he uses these techniques and he wound up overperforming his polls by several points. Now, he`s not running that operation anymore. But I think Iowa will be a big test to see whether a grass-roots operation and distributed organizing can perform in caucuses.

TT: What`s going to come from the DCCC cutting off consultants who work for candidates running against incumbents?

RG: I think they`re really going to come to regret this decision. One of the one of the main sources of power that the district [clique] has is this ecosystem that it has built up. It is the consulting world; it revolves around these party committees. And that means that you know you kind of, whether or not there`s a blacklist, got to stay in the good graces of these party committee structures. But if people create an entire independent structure and they have no control over it, that gives this nascent movement access to professional [campaign] assistance.

Birmingham: An Alabama man says he has completed his quest to mow lawns for veterans in all 50 states. Rodney Smith Jr. tweeted Friday that he was headed home from Hawaii after cutting grass on Oahu. He got to his last state with help from Delta Air Lines. He says he will now continue providing free lawn care to the elderly, disabled, single mothers and veterans in Alabama. Smith was inspired to begin a free yard mowing service in 2015 after seeing an elderly man cutting his lawn. That morphed into a mission to cut grass for service veterans in every U.S. state. Smith drove across the country this spring posting photos of himself with veterans as he cut their lawns. Individual and corporate donations helped pay for hotel rooms and other expenses.

Anchorage: The National Park Service has completed a project to relieve an interspecies traffic jam. A new elevated bridge and boardwalk across the Brooks River in Katmai National Park and Preserve has replaced a river-level bridge that was often closed to human tourists because it was occupied by locals – brown bears. The replacement for the old floating bridge was more than a decade in the making. Bears catching salmon are a huge draw for the park on the Alaska Peninsula, the arm of land extending from Alaska’s southwest corner toward the Aleutian Islands. The park service estimates 2,200 brown bears inhabit the park, a number exceeding the people who live on the peninsula. The new bridge, which cost $5.6 million, features bear-proof gates on both ends.

Phoenix: A philanthropic arm of Jay-Z’s entertainment company Roc Nation has offered to provide legal support for a couple who say police used excessive force and threatened to shoot them in an incident caught on video. Dravon Ames, 22, and his pregnant fiancee, Aisha Harper, 24, were pulled over by Phoenix police May 29. They allege police pointed a gun at their children, threatened them, and physically harmed Ames and their daughter because the child took a doll from a dollar store. The couple is demanding $10 million from the city of Phoenix. A notice of claim filed Thursday says the police officers committed battery, unlawful imprisonment, false arrest and infliction of emotional distress in addition to violating their civil rights. Team ROC has secured high-profile attorney Alex Spiro to join the family’s legal team pro-bono.

Arkansas

Little Rock: Long before she became the spokeswoman for the Trump administration, Sarah Huckabee Sanders was a well-known figure in the Natural State who appeared in campaign ads for her dad, former Gov. Mike Huckabee, and learned about the state’s rough-and-tumble politics by working on his campaign and others. Now, speculation that Sanders may run for governor in her home state shakes up a race that’s three years away but was already expected to be a crowded and expensive fight among Republicans. Trump announced Thursday that Sanders was leaving as White House press secretary and encouraged her to run for Arkansas governor, a job her dad held for 10 1/ 2 years. Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson was re-elected in November, and the seat will open up in 2022 when he’s barred by term limits from running again.

California

San Diego: High school graduation speeches are usually full of praise for teachers and officials. So it was more than a little unusual when a valedictorian sarcastically thanked them for making her self-sufficient by doing nothing to help her. The San Diego Union-Tribune reports San Ysidro High senior Nataly Buhr initially thanked parents, friends and some teachers. Then she thanked a school counselor for teaching her to fend for herself by never being available and the main office staff for not informing her of scholarships until a day before the deadline. Buhr also thanked a teacher she said was regularly intoxicated for being an example of “the dangers of alcoholism.” The district says Buhr’s speech didn’t follow her pre-approved version and was inappropriate. But Buhr’s mother said she couldn’t be prouder.

Denver: Two decades after the name “Columbine” became synonymous with a school shooting, the suburban Denver community surrounding the school is debating whether it’s time to tear down a building that also became a beacon for people obsessed with the killings. School officials say the number of people trying to get close to or even inside the school reached record levels this year, the 20th anniversary of the 1999 attack that killed 13 people. People try to peek into the windows of the school library, mistaking it for the long-demolished room where most of the victims died, or ask people on campus how to take a tour. The buses full of tourists have mostly stopped over the years, but not the visitors. This year alone, security staff contacted more than 2,400 “unauthorized” people on Columbine’s campus.

Connecticut

Hartford: Officials are kicking off an effort to encourage students graduating from high schools and others to consider attending one of the state’s 12 community colleges. The first in a series of events this summer will be held Monday at 11 a.m. at the Prince Technical High School in Hartford. The summer enrollment campaign is being dubbed “Aspire” and is focusing on those who may not have considered a post-secondary education. Admissions staff from Manchester and Capital Community Colleges will be on hand to talk to any interested potential students. In May, the Connecticut Board of Regents eliminated the application fee for Connecticut’s community colleges. Various officials will be on hand for Monday’s event, including Democratic U.S. Rep. John Larson and Connecticut State Colleges and Universities President Mark Ojakian.

Delaware

Wilmington: As a guest on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” on Friday, actress and Wilmington native Aubrey Plaza joined Colbert for a segment called “Community Calendar,” in which the duo detailed and poked fun at events happening near the city. The show rolled a montage of local sites including the Caesar Rodney statue and the Rockford Tower. “You know what we say in Wilmington – it’s a Wilming-ton of fun,” Plaza said. “Oh, I’m Del-aware of that,” Colbert retorted. The two ran through a list of events including the Wilmington Pirate Festival on June 29 and the American Helicopter Museum and Education Center’s FatherFest on June 16. The description of Sunday’s FatherFest promised classic cars, motorcycles and a beer garden. “So stop by and see what happens when you mix vehicles, alcohol and middle-aged despair,” Plaza deadpanned.

District of Columbia

Washington: The top economic official for the city is leaving his post to join Amazon. The Washington Post reports Mayor Muriel E. Bowser’s office announced the impending departure of Brian Kenner on Thursday. Kenner is the deputy mayor for planning and economic development and has been a part of the mayor’s Cabinet since she took office in 2015. He’s set to leave his District of Columbia role next month. The mayor will then appoint someone on an interim basis. Kenner previously worked to incentivize Amazon to build its second headquarters in the district. The online behemoth instead chose Arlington County, Virginia. Kenner told The Washington Business Journal that Amazon approached him about a month ago. He says he’ll work in the company’s D.C.-based policy shop.

Key West: A South Carolina woman has reached the Florida Keys, completing a 2,575-mile walk to give attention to the opioid overdose crisis. Jessie Grieb finished her East Coast Overdose Awareness Walk on Friday at Key West’s Southernmost Point in the Continental U.S. marker. Friday marked the fourth anniversary of her brother Brian’s death by accidental overdose. Grieb’s boyfriend succumbed to heroin, and she has struggled herself with addiction since she was 17. The Pawleys Island resident started her journey in Fort Kent, Maine, on July 28, 2018, after she had suffered a relapse. To help carry supplies, Grieb pushed a small cart named “Lieutenant Dan” in honor of the “Forrest Gump” character who dealt with addiction in the movie.

Atlanta: Grammy-nominated rapper 21 Savage has given $25,000 to the Southern Poverty Law Center after the watchdog organization helped him while he was in federal immigration custody earlier this year. The rapper, whose real name is She’yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, was arrested Feb. 3 in what U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has said was a targeted operation over his expired visa. Abraham-Joseph is a British citizen and moved to the U.S. when he was 7. In a statement, immigration attorney Charles Kuck said the Atlanta-based rapper wants to support the work the SPLC has done to give immigrants legal representation and fight what Kuck called ICE’s “oppressively adverse conditions of detention.” The rapper spent 10 days at the Irwin County Detention Center before he was released on a $100,000 bond.

Hawaii

Honolulu: A man injured during a rockfall in a state park was among five people cited for trespassing, officials say. State officials cited Lincoln Hittner of Honolulu for trespassing in a closed park, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Hittner was treated for minor injuries by Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement officers in Sacred Falls State Park, officials say. Hittner described his near-miss with the rockfall as “15 seconds of terror,” officials say. He was among a group of six that included Hawaii residents and a visiting Australian who all received citations, authorities say. Sacred Falls State Park has been closed and warning signs posted since a 1999 accident left eight people dead and dozens hurt, officials say. The state has extensively publicized the dangers of entering closed areas, including a video about Sacred Falls, according to the Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Idaho

Preston: The cult comedy “Napoleon Dynamite” turns 15 years old this month, a milestone for a movie filmed in the Gem State that became an early breakaway hit in today’s era of pop-culture geek celebration. The movie that created the “Vote for Pedro” T-shirt and made Napoleon’s disgusted exclamation of “gosh!” into a 2004 catchphrase is celebrating its anniversary this month. Made for just $400,000 in and around Franklin County, it would ultimately gross over $46 million as a word-of-mouth hit before social media took off. The movie told the story of its socially awkward title character, who ultimately triumphed because of his quirks rather than in spite of them. Its success added to a rising profile for unapologetic nerds just before hits like “The Big Bang Theory” ushered in a new era of geek glory.

Illinois

Chicago: Some endangered birds could ground a beachfront music festival proposed for late August. Promoters of Mamby on the Beach are seeking a permit from the Chicago Park District to move the show to Montrose Beach on the city’s north side. But two piping plovers lately have been making the beach their home. Four eggs were discovered and turned over to the Lincoln Park Zoo last week. The plovers appear to be making a new nest, said Louise Clemency of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. MAMBY on the Beach is scheduled to take place Aug. 23-24 and expected to draw up to 20,000 people to the Lake Michigan lakefront each day. But Jill Niland of the Montrose Lakefront Coalition says there are concerns about the number of people expected to attend and noise pollution that could disrupt the piping plovers. The small shorebird is on state endangered species lists and listed as threatened at the federal level.

Indiana

Indianapolis: A change state lawmakers made this year to a tax incentive for startups is being hailed as a big win for the tech industry because it promises to make it easier for fledgling businesses to attract out-of-state investors. The Indianapolis Business Journal reports that legislation signed by Gov. Eric Holcomb will allow investors to transfer Indiana’s Venture Capital Investment tax credits, starting next year. Transferring the credits will allow out-of-state investors to essentially sell them to someone in the state who can take advantage. Tech community leaders say the change will encourage out-of-state individuals to invest in Indiana startups. The state’s VCI tax credit program allows someone who invests in an Indiana startup to claim a tax credit worth 20% of the investment. The credit is capped at $1 million.

Iowa

Des Moines: Torrential rain this spring prevented most Midwest farmers from planting their crops, but while the federal government provides help to growers of corn and soybeans, those who grow so-called specialty crops are largely on their own. Although the lack of federal safety net programs for farmers who grow everything from arugula to zucchini isn’t new, one of the wettest springs in U.S. history has focused attention on the special status of commodity crops, primarily corn, soybeans, cotton, rice and wheat. Iowa organic farmer Andrew Dunham shrugs at the situation, noting that “there are no federal bailouts for vegetable farmers.” Iowa State University economist Chad Hart says crops like corn and soybeans are treated differently because they’re so important to the national economy, and shortages would be painful, particularly to the livestock industry.

Kansas

Wichita: Two endangered Mexican wolf pups from a Kansas zoo have been released into the wild in Arizona. The Wichita Eagle reports that a male puppy, named Traveler, and a female puppy, named Jaunt, were born at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita. They were 2 weeks old last month when they were placed with a litter whose mother is wild. Mexican wolves are considered critically endangered, with fewer than 150 members of the species remaining in the wild. They are native to the southwestern United States in Arizona and New Mexico, and in Chihuahua, Mexico. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will remotely observe the pack to monitor the results of the cross-fostering. But senior zookeeper Nancy Smith says the pack seems to be doing well.

Kentucky

Louisville: The Louisville Zoo has narrowed a naming competition for its new bongo calf down to three characters from the beloved Marvel masterpiece “Guardians of the Galaxy”: Drax, Groot and Rocket. Until June 23, zoo visitors can make a donation to choose their favorite name. There will be a naming kiosk with three slots in the plaza to the right near the zoo’s entrance. The calf will be given the name that receives the most donations, to be announced during the week of June 24. All donations in the competition will go to the zoo’s conservation efforts. Bongos are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species and are listed as a “near threatened” species. The future Drax, Groot or Rocket is on exhibit along with his mother and the other bongos.

Louisiana

New Orleans: A state court official has agreed to take steps to make sure defendants in criminal cases aren’t jailed because they cannot afford bail. The agreement is detailed in a federal court order filed Thursday involving Magistrate Judge Harry Cantrell and plaintiffs who accused Cantrell of violating an earlier federal judgment regarding low-income defendants. As a magistrate judge in the criminal district court in New Orleans, Cantrell sets bail for people arrested on various state charges. The agreement details requirements for determining whether a defendant can afford bail and whether the defendant is a flight risk or poses a danger when alternatives to bail are considered. U.S. District Judge Eldon Fallon issued Thursday’s order detailing the agreement and closing the case against Cantrell.

Maine

Dover-Foxcroft: Police say a moose smashed through the window of a vacant pizzeria. Piscataquis County corrections officer Matt Poole snapped a photo of the moose stepping through broken glass onto East Main Street early Friday. The Dover-Foxcroft Police Department posted on Facebook, “We found the suspect and they are not in custody. Boring right?” Maine has plenty of moose, and sometimes they wander into towns. But Police Chief Ryan Reardon says it was the first time in 26 years he’d seen one run into a building. State biologists estimate Maine’s moose population is between 50,000 and 70,000.

Maryland

Baltimore: The Baltimore Museum of Art has so far this year added more than 70 contemporary and historic artworks to its broad collection. BMA director Christopher Bedford said in a statement that the new acquisitions highlight the curatorial team’s vision in forging connections “across artists and movements within the museum’s collection.” Additions include 19th-century prints by Italian art nouveau illustrator Manuel Orazi, a film by Cuban American artist Ana Mendieta and a painting by contemporary American artist Mary Lovelace O’Neal. Various new pieces were purchased with proceeds from last year’s auction of seven works by 20th-century artists, including Andy Warhol, to help diversify and contemporize its collection. The BMA has nearly 100,000 pieces, including the world’s largest holding of Henri Matisse’s creations.

Massachusetts

Boston: A bit of seat belt art is part of a new public information campaign aimed at getting young men to buckle up when they’re behind the wheel. State officials say they commissioned teens through Artists for Humanity to create a free-standing art installation that will help deliver the message that seat belts can save lives. The 6-foot-by-12-foot artwork is wrapped with real seat belts and will be displayed at locations around the state during the summer. The new campaign is called “Love Clicks” and is based on research that suggests young men are more likely to use seat belts if someone they love asks them to do so. Data suggests that while seat belt use is increasing in Massachusetts, men still buckle up at a lower rate than women.

Michigan

Lansing: Pride flags are flying on the state office building for the first time in Michigan’s history. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered that starting Saturday, two of the iconic rainbow flags will fly on the George W. Romney Building to help celebrate June as Pride Month in Michigan. The flying of the flags comes after Whitmer signed a proclamation designating June as Pride Month to mark the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising in New York City. A police raid on a gay bar called the Stonewall Inn triggered a series of riots and sparked the nascent LGBT movement in the country and around the world. In a news release, Whitmer said celebrating Pride Month helps ensure that members of Michigan’s LGBTQ community “are treated with the respect they deserve.”

Minnesota

Minneapolis: University of Minnesota regents have voted to allow beer and wine sales in the general seating sections of the school’s basketball and hockey arenas. Friday’s vote was unanimous and comes as the school is trying to drive up revenue at sporting events. The university has been dropping some ticket prices in response to declining attendance. The Star Tribune reports that athletic director Mark Coyle told regents that campus police back the expanded alcohol sales, as does a fan advisory council. TCF Bank Stadium expanded alcohol sales to general seating areas in 2012. Overall alcohol revenue at the football stadium has been about $1.3 million annually, with most of that coming from general seating, the Star Tribune reports.

Mississippi

Meridian: Five more members have been added to a hall of fame that honors the arts and entertainment in the Magnolia State. The Mississippi Arts + Entertainment Experience announced the additions Thursday of four musicians and one literary figure. Country singer Tammy Wynette of Tremont was lauded as the first lady of country music. Singer and guitarist Bo Diddley helped bridge the blues and rock ’n’ roll. Pianist and singer Jerry Lee Lewis is one of the last surviving pioneers of rock ’n’ roll. Margaret Walker Alexander was a poet, novelist and Jackson State University literature professor. John Lee Hooker was a blues guitarist and five-time Grammy Award winner. The new designees join 23 existing members. The Mississippi Arts + Entertainment Experience in Meridian includes exhibits, performance spaces and a recording studio.

Missouri

Cape Girardeau: A bar that served as a set location for the movie “Gone Girl” will reopen later this month. The Southeast Missourian reports that The Bar in downtown Cape Girardeau had been closed since last fall. Representative for the management company that owns it and several other downtown properties say the establishment will resume serving drinks June 27. Formerly a catering business, the corner site was transformed into The Bar for the 2014 film “Gone Girl” starring Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike and Neil Patrick Harris. After the movie was released, the set was converted into a real restaurant and bar. General manager Derek Vaughn says it will no longer serve food and will only be open Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 4 p.m. until 1:30 a.m.

Montana

Helena: Lawmakers did not have enough support to override four vetoes by Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock. Poll results released Friday showed lawmakers did not reach the two-thirds majority needed in the state House and the Senate to override vetoes on a bill that would have given health insurers the ability to regulate pharmacy benefit managers, two bills that would have created tax breaks and a campus free-speech bill. Bullock vetoed a bill proposed by Republican State Auditor Matt Rosendale that sought to lower prescription drug prices by requiring pharmacy benefit managers to pass on drug manufacturer rebates to insurers. Bullock said the proposal would actually increase costs. In total, lawmakers voted 108-40 in favor of Rosendale’s bill during the session, but the override effort fell short by five votes in each chamber.

Nebraska

Lincoln: Visitors to six state recreation areas will be allowed to light off fireworks July 4. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission says those recreation areas are Branched Oak near Malcolm, Fort Kearny near Kearney, Pawnee near Emerald, Wagon Train near Hickman, and those near Memphis and Fremont. Those parks will permit fireworks from 8 a.m. until midnight on July 4 only. Signs at recreation areas will point the way to designated fireworks sites, and their boundaries will be clearly marked. Use of fireworks elsewhere in state areas or at other times is prohibited. Only fireworks approved for sale in Nebraska are permitted, and visitors must pick up expended fireworks and deposit them in appropriate containers.

Nevada

Reno: Burning Man won’t be growing this year, but there could be at least one major change upon entry – drug screenings. The Bureau of Land Management on Friday issued the final environmental impact statement for Burning Man, denying the Burning Man organization its sought-after growth to 100,000 people but granting it more time to address a number of environmental and security concerns. The federal agency may, however, hire a private security firm this year to conduct drug screenings. Or it might wait until 2020, according to BLM spokesman Rudy Evenson. As for the growth of the event, the population cap will remain at 80,000 people for the weeklong event held each year over Labor Day weekend in Northern Nevada’s Black Rock Desert.

New Hampshire

Hampton Falls: Enthusiastic clapping – and some furious flapping – marked the end to the saga of designating an official state raptor. Republican Gov. Chris Sununu on Friday signed a bill honoring the red-tailed hawk. As applause broke out, a bird being held just over his shoulder began flapping its wings. The bill was proposed by Hampton Falls fourth graders four years ago, but it was killed after one lawmaker injected the issue of abortion into the debate by saying the hawk’s habit of tearing apart prey “limb from limb” would make it an ideal mascot for Planned Parenthood. The students, now in eighth grade, lobbied for a new bill this year and were successful. Sununu told them they exemplified a lesson in perseverance.

New Jersey

Trenton: A year after gunfire shattered the city’s annual Art All Night festival, hundreds flocked to this year’s celebration of local art, music, food and films – even though, strictly speaking, it no longer quite lived up to the name. The formerly “all night” festival took a break from 1 a.m. to 7 a.m. Sunday before resuming for the morning and afternoon. And for the first time in the festival’s 13-year history, the event was fenced off, and attendees had to go through security checkpoints before entering the event space that included visible police and security officers. The June 17 shooting last year left a suspect dead and 22 people injured in what authorities said looked like neighborhood gang dispute. But those attending this year to examine the more than 800 pieces of art displayed inside and outside the Roebling Wireworks Building spoke of moving forward rather than looking backward.

New Mexico

Santa Fe: The state’s film industry appears to be on the brink of a boom thanks to abortion law controversies in other states and expanded incentives. A recent spike in film production in the state comes as Hollywood targets both Georgia and Louisiana over recently passed restrictive abortion laws, the Albuquerque Journal reports. The political developments are being watched closely in New Mexico, which is poised to benefit even though state officials have said there’s no organized campaign to lure film productions from those states. The jump also comes as New Mexico is set to more than double its annual state spending cap on film incentives. In addition, NBCUniversal announced Friday it will build a television and film studio in a warehouse district just north of downtown Albuquerque as it seeks to expand its footprint in one of the fastest-growing film production hubs in the country.

New York

New York: New York City police say a 29-year-old officer died Friday in the department’s third suspected suicide in less than two weeks. Police say he shot himself in the head on a Staten Island street near the 121st Precinct to which the officer was assigned. His identity had not been released as of late Friday. The week before, two longtime officers died in suspected suicides within 24 hours of each other. Deputy Chief Steven Silks was found dead in a police vehicle in Queens on June 5. Detective Joseph Calabrese was found the next day at a Brooklyn beach. Police say both died from self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the head. In the wake of the deaths, Commissioner James O’Neill sent a note reminding the more than 36,000 officers and 19,000 civilians in the NYPD that help is available if they’re feeling depressed, hopeless or otherwise contemplating self-harm.

North Carolina

Raleigh: The state won’t clear voting-machine makers to sell their systems to county elections boards until it learns more about who owns them, the elections board chairman said Friday. The decision comes amid worries of foreign election interference that have grown since special counsel Robert Mueller’s April report into Russian efforts to sway the 2016 election. Mueller’s report “essentially says everybody should be concerned about this, and everybody should be looking harder at a lot of these things to make sure we’re protected as best we can be,” said Robert Cordle, the head of the state elections board. “It’s just a matter of doing our due diligence now.” The state board is giving the three companies that have already passed several rounds of screening until Friday to disclose anyone holding a 5% or greater interest in their company, their parent company or any subsidiaries.

North Dakota

Bismarck: Lutheran Social Services of North Dakota plans to acquire the Ruth Meiers Hospitality House’s property in Bismarck and turn the facility into affordable housing. Lutheran Social Services is partnering with CommunityWorks North Dakota on the acquisition. The plan is to take over the facility by the end of summer. The sale of the site is “in the works,” Lutheran Social Services CEO Jessica Thomasson told The Bismarck Tribune. Choice Bank took ownership of the facility last month. “The reason we got involved was to try to preserve these 85 units of affordable housing in Bismarck because it’s hard when a community loses an asset like that to ever get it back,” Thomasson said. She said the plans include retaining the 85 apartments, renovating some of the units and common areas, and turning underutilized space into 20 additional apartments.

Ohio

Cincinnati: Farmer Jay Butterfield survived a harrowing afternoon recently after being buried up to his neck inside a soybean bin. The 70-year-old was trying to break up wet clumps of the crop inside a 30-foot-tall bin when he sank up to his knees. The material along the bin’s sides began to engulf him. Within 15 minutes, Butterfield was buried up to his neck and thought he was probably going to die. The three-hour rescue effort on the farm north of Cincinnati involved 52 first responders from a dozen departments. Butterfield acknowledges he’s a lucky man. Last year, 30 people were buried in grain on farms, and half died. Butterfield’s friend Charlie Groh died in a corn bin in 2013 in a neighboring township. It happens so often, in fact, that fire departments in farming regions undergo special training and acquire equipment just for these situations.

Oklahoma

Concho: Families and friends of missing or slain American Indian women and girls are again calling for justice for their loved ones. About 200 people gathered Friday near the headquarters of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes in Concho. Many wore red and marched, holding signs with pictures of women on them. Similar demonstrations have taken place in other states amid growing concern that police nationwide are not adequately identifying or reporting cases of missing and murdered Native American and Alaska Native women and girls. Those demographic groups have some of the nation’s highest rates of sexual and domestic violence. Kateri Fletcher, a Cheyenne and Arapaho tribal government official who helped organize the event, said it was designed to bring awareness and show support for families who still need answers.

Oregon

Aurora: A global hemp research lab in the state is part of a larger movement to bring the standardization to hemp that traditional crops like corn and cotton enjoy. It’s a critical step toward accountability and consistency in an industry that’s sprung up almost overnight since the U.S. legalized hemp last year. The Global Hemp Innovation Center was unveiled recently by Oregon State University and will be the largest such research hub in the U.S. Oregon State will also begin certifying hemp seeds so that farmers can be confident they’re getting quality seeds. A national review board for hemp varieties is also getting up and running. Interest in the cannabis crop has exploded because of hemp-derived CBD, a compound marketed as having health benefits but without the high caused by marijuana.

Pennsylvania

Bloomsburg: For the past 15 years, Bloomsburg University students have been quietly stocking the shelves of a town food cupboard, donating more than a ton of food and more than $15,000 in meal-plan funds each year. With the help of those donations, volunteers at the Bloomsburg Food Cupboard have been able to bag breakfast, lunch and snacks for elementary students from poor families to take home each weekend, says cupboard director Martha Sheehe. University students who have meal plan “FLEX” money left in their accounts at the end of the academic year can either spend it down or donate it, says Tom McGuire, director of media relations at BU. Sometimes students will buy cases of water or soda to drain their accounts, but many donate their remaining cash to ARAMARK, the university’s dining service, which then purchases food to fill the elementary students’ “Panther Packs.”

Rhode Island

Providence: The state has preserved 43 acres of open space to provide more recreational opportunities. The Department of Environmental Management says it’s using about $250,000 provided through open space bonds to permanently protect forested land in Charlestown for public recreational access. DEM Director Janet Coit says she’s delighted to secure this valuable parcel and encouraged residents to explore it. The property abuts DEM’s Burlingame Management Area. That area, with the adjoining Burlingame State Park, encompasses more than 4,000 contiguous acres of protected land that’s managed for public recreation, including fishing, hunting and camping. The department purchased the property from private landowners and, at their request, granted a conservation easement to the Charlestown Land Trust to increase the level of protection on the property.

South Carolina

Summerville: A mapping error from 1897 is causing 21st-century headaches for people living near Charleston. Surveyors 122 years ago messed up drawing the county line between Berkeley and Dorchester counties. The Post and Courier of Charleston reports the mistake was officially corrected last year, leaving an apartment complex and a senior living home split between the two counties. State officials have been working for a decade to precisely map county boundaries. Tenants at the Farmington Village Apartments are told that the unit they select will decide whether their children go to schools in Berkeley County or Dorchester County. The Village at Summerville senior living complex is split, too, but has arranged to have Dorchester County Emergency Medical Service answer all of its calls. The redrawn boundary has changed tax bills too.

South Dakota

Rapid City: A business development center that was launched more than a decade ago on the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology campus is coming out of the shadows. The Rapid City Journal reports that the Ascent Innovation Center, which opened in a remote corner of the campus in 2006, has outgrown its space and is poised to expand to a more visible location, in downtown Rapid City. School officials say construction on the $12 million business incubator could begin this summer, thanks in part to a $3 million federal grant that puts the new center in range of being fully funded. The architect of the project is Wisconsin-based Strang Inc., which specializes in design of innovation centers and research parks. The building is slated for completion in late 2020.

Tennessee

Memphis: Peanuts, cracker jacks, hot dogs ... mayonnaise? One fan added a weird twist to baseball stadium cuisine when he started eating from a mayonnaise jar during the Memphis Redbirds’ 8-4 loss to the Las Vegas Aviators at AutoZone Park on Saturday. He started eating early in the game, and by the fourth inning he moved to a different seat and continued eating from the jar with a spoon before security had him moved to another seat. That didn’t stop the mayo eater as he found a new place and continued eating it in the fifth inning. The Redbirds’ Twitter account kept a running commentary, as insiders were apparently as shocked and confused as fans watching it on social media. Even Minor League Baseball’s Twitter account got wind of the fan’s snack and tweeted further disgust.

Texas

Houston: The groups behind an innovative way of rebuilding homes after a natural disaster say their approach will save money and get people into housing more quickly. They’re hoping a bill signed last week by Gov. Greg Abbott related to disaster planning will boost their efforts. The housing program known as Rapido, Spanish for fast, debuted its first such home built in Houston last week. Under the program, a core unit made up of pre-built panels is assembled. A family lives in this core while the rest of the house is built around them. The Texas agency that has handled housing recovery following Hurricane Harvey in 2017 says it supports such innovations but says rule changes would be needed to free up federal funding to support such ideas.

Orem: When John Frey’s family requested 101 birthday cards to celebrate the World War II veteran’s 101st birthday in Utah, they were expecting to get 500 at most. At a celebration June 8, a day after his birthday, Frey ended up with well over 5,000 cards, the Daily Herald reports. According to the report, Frey’s request spread quickly after the Associated Press picked up the story from the Daily Herald in May and it appeared in news outlets across the country. The cards came from all 50 states and at least 12 countries. Entire classrooms of children, military veterans and Utah’s elected officials wanted to wish the former mechanic/machinist for the U.S. Army a happy birthday. Frey said he had not expected to ever get so many cards.

Vermont

Montpelier: U.S. production of maple syrup increased slightly this year, even though the season was shorter than last year’s. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said last week that the country produced 4.2 million gallons of the pancake topper, up 1% from 2018. Leading producer Vermont made more than 2 million gallons, an increase over 2018. Data shows Vermont was followed by New York, Maine and Wisconsin. The USDA says the earliest sap flow reported was Jan. 5 in New York. The season lasted an average of 30 days in syrup-producing states, compared with 42 last year. Amanda Voyer, of the Vermont Maple Sugar Makers Association, says the conditions made for some strong days of sap flow in trees.

Virginia

Richmond: State Attorney General Mark Herring is calling for the legalization of marijuana. Herring said Saturday that Virginia should start decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana and eventually legalize the drug. The Democratic attorney general said criminal prosecutions are costly to the state and local governments and disproportionately affect African Americans. Herring made the remarks in an op-ed in the Daily Press and in comments to reporters at a Democratic fundraiser in Richmond. Herring’s announcement won’t have any practical impact on marijuana prosecutions, which are typically handled at the local level. But Herring said he hopes his public support for legalization will help spur lawmakers to act. The Republican-controlled General Assembly has killed past efforts to decriminalize marijuana.

Bellingham: A Christian organization has fired a teenager from his job as a camp counselor because he is gay. The Bellingham Herald reports Jace Taylor says he was terminated Tuesday after being hired last month by THE FIRS to be a Fir Creek camp counselor. The nondenominational Christian organization confirmed that Taylor’s sexual orientation was the reason for his firing. Executive Director Tom Beaumont says when it became evident that Taylor didn’t personally align with the group’s statements of faith, it determined it could not use him in the role. Under state law, an employer cannot discriminate against anyone based on sexual orientation. QLaw Foundation executive director Denise Diskin says religious nonprofit employers are not defined as employers under the law. Taylor says he intends to picket on the first day of camp to inform people there of the situation.

West Virginia

Roanoke: Students participating in the state’s new program for free tuition at public community colleges will have to pass a drug test that includes marijuana. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports the board of the West Virginia Community and Technical College System listened to a presentation Thursday from a consultant helping launch the program. Kathy Butler said the testing will include the marijuana component THC as well as opiates, cocaine, amphetamines and other drugs. Butler said the testing is modeled after that used by WorkForce West Virginia, a state job placement and training organization. Students will be required to pass the drug test within 60 days of the start of a semester to receive free tuition for that semester. The policy does allow exemptions for legally prescribed medicines.

Milwaukee: Hiring in the restaurant and hotel industry is difficult right now. More than 4,000 positions in the area are advertised on one of the largest job sites, Indeed. Hospitality businesses in the city say they don’t have enough workers ready to serve the tens of thousands of people who will come to town for the 2020 Democratic National Convention. At the same time, Milwaukee has large segments of its population that are unemployed and could benefit from work in the service industry. “It’s ships passing in the night – people looking for employees and the people looking for jobs,” Mayor Tom Barrett says. Business and city leaders are starting to make plans for how to use the DNC to establish a pipeline for workers to enter the service industry –a resource that would exist after the convention leaves.

Riverton: Students at a high school here will be able to take classes on the Northern Arapaho language. The Riverton Ranger reports that the Fremont County School District 25 Board of Trustees has approved offering two courses of the language at Riverton High School. Riverton Principal John Griffith says parents and students have been suggesting the idea for years in the district near the Wind River Reservation. He says the school now has a staff member with a desire to teach the language. The first class will acquaint students with the basic sounds of the Arapaho language. They also will learn the Arapaho alphabet. In the second class, students will use the basic sounds to form Arapaho words and phrases in order to have conversations or tell short stories.

The Trump administration on Wednesday scrapped plans to kill a U.S. Forest Service program that trains disadvantaged young people for rural jobs after a bipartisan outcry from Congress.

The decision came after weeks of heavy pressure from lawmakers from Montana to Kentucky, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). The Forest Service had planned to begin layoffs of 1,110 employees by September, believed to be the largest number of cuts to the federal workforce in a decade.

The offices of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, whose agencies oversee the 25 Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers and dozens of others in urban areas, said in a joint statement that the administration is committed to making the program “better and stronger.”

“For the time being, USDA does not intend to transfer these centers to [the Labor Department] to allow management to determine a pathway that will maximize opportunity and results for students, minimize disruptions, and improve overall performance and integrity,” the statement said.

The administration “will conduct a robust organizational review to determine the appropriate course of action, keeping in mind the [Forest Service] mission, the students we serve, and the American taxpayers.”

[Trump administration to pull out of rural Job Corps program, laying off 1,100 federal employees]

The reversal, first reported by Politico, comes less than a month after Forest Service chief Vicki Christiansen told her staff in an anguished phone call that many of them would be laid off.

Nine Job Corps centers in Montana, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Virginia, Washington state, North Carolina, Oregon and Kentucky were scheduled to close, and an additional 16 were to be taken over by private companies or states.

Agriculture officials said at the time that that many of the centers operated by the Forest Service were low-performing, some with security problems, low enrollment and uncertain job prospects for graduates. Perdue said Job Corps was not a “core mission” of the Forest Service.

But the planned closures quickly ran headlong into political reality: Most were in Republican strongholds President Trump won in 2016.

While the president and his GOP allies on Capitol Hill have put a high premium on downsizing the federal government, lawmakers facing reelection campaigns next year were loath to sacrifice economic drivers back home, however small.

In a rare break with the administration, Republicans joined Democrats in fighting not just the shutdowns but the effort to hand over operations to private companies. The opponents included Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), whose timber-producing district on the Canadian border already is losing jobs, and Rep. H. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.), whose Southwest Virginia district in Appalachian coal country has yet to see the fruits of Trump’s promises to revive the industry.

With two centers in Kentucky on the closure list, McConnell wrote Perdue and Acosta a letter of protest, citing the loss to “distressed Kentucky counties with unemployment rates above the national average,” which “need more support, not less.”

In a separate letter signed by 51 Democrats and Republicans, lawmakers took issue with the administration’s claim that many of the centers announced for closure were poor performers.

Job Corps has its roots in the New Deal-era Civilian Conservation Corps, the popular work-relief program for unemployed, unmarried men that operated from 1933 to 1942. The current program dates to the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.

Many of the centers employ fewer than 100 people and train as many students each year. But in small-town America, they have an outsize economic presence.

In perhaps the clearest sign of GOP discontent, Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) issued a video on Twitter in recent weeks that showed him claiming victory for saving the center on the cut list in his state with a personal call to the president. Daines said Trump promised him the Anaconda Job Corps center would stay open.

The fate of the others dangled until Wednesday, with Agriculture officials saying only that they were reviewing public comments on their plan.

Daines’s fellow senator from Montana, Jon Tester, was the most vocal Democratic critic of the plan, introducing legislation to stop the closures from moving forward.

“Suddenly, without any real reason or justification, the President pulled the plug on one of the most successful initiatives in rural America and my office was flooded with stories and objections from Montanans,” Tester said in a statement Wednesday night.

Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, which represents Job Corps employees, said Perdue and Acosta “were only beginning to see the outrage stemming from this misguided plan.”

“With this change, numerous rural, small-town communities across the country have been saved from devastation,” he said.", Trump administration backtracks on closure of Job Corps program after bipartisan opposition from Congress ,6-2019
"A survey of the 56 senators who confirmed embattled labor secretary Alex Acosta has found that only one of the fifty Republicans who voted in Acosta`s favor is openly critical of the former US attorney`s handling of Jeffrey Epstein`s prosecution.

Acosta is under fire for his involvement in a 2008 plea deal with the billionaire sex offender during his tenure as the US attorney in Miami, with prominent Democratic lawmakers now calling for Acosta to resign.

New sex trafficking charges filed in New York earlier this week against the 66-year-old financier have placed renewed scrutiny on the plea deal brokered by Acosta during his time as a US attorney in Florida. Despite being accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls and facing life in prison, Epstein ultimately pleaded guilty to less serious charges related to prostitution and spent just 13 months in jail, most of it in a work release program that allowed him leave the jail six days a week to work at his private home office. (Epstein also registered as a sex offender as part of the deal).

Epstein`s alleged victims were never notified of the secret deal, with a federal judge ruling in February that the Department of Justice violated the Crime Victims` Rights Act by not disclosing to them the non-prosecution agreement with Epstein.

During a press conference on Wednesday to address his handling of the Epstein case, particularly the lenient plea deal, Acosta struck back against criticism and suggested the deal was better than nothing. He declined to apologize to victims or offer his regret, instead noting how ""we live in a very different world. Today`s world treats victims very, very differently.""

Democratic leaders such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, have demanded that Acosta step down from his position. House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings also sent a letter to Acosta on Wednesday requesting that he testify about his decision to authorize the non-prosecution agreement for Epstein.

INSIDER reached out to all of the current senators who voted to confirm Acosta as Labor Secretary, despite his role in the Epstein deal. At the time that Acosta was confirmed, in April 2017, 60 senators, including eight Democrats, voted in favor of Acosta. Six senators responded back to our request for comment.

Republican criticism over the Justice Department`s handling of the Epstein case

Republican senator Benjamin Sasse of Nebraska has been vocal in his demands for the Justice Department to investigate its treatment of Epstein, following the shocking Miami Herald investigative series published earlier this year that included interviews from scores of women who said they were sexually abused by the lucrative hedge fund manager.

During Attorney General William Barr`s January confirmation hearing, Sasse brought up the plea deal, questioning Barr on whether there would be a thorough investigation into the matter if he was confirmed as Attorney General. ""I`ll make sure your questions are answered on this case,"" Barr responded at the time. Sasse ultimately voted to confirm Barr`s nomination.

In a statement provided to INSIDER on Wednesday, a spokesperson for Sasse said the senator ""believes that Epstein received a pathetically soft sentence and that this cannot happen again,"" adding that ""we will wait to comment on the particular details of past and present DOJ employees until DOJ shares its finding,"" such as whether he thinks Acosta should resign as labor secretary.

CNN reporter Manu Raju added on Twitter that Sasse ""wouldn`t comment or take questions moments ago on whether Acosta should resign as Labor secretary.""

The only other Republican senator to respond to INSIDER`s query was Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Chairman Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. He described Acosta`s handling of the case as ""a prosecutial judgement"" that was ""vetted by our committee.""

""The Justice Department under the last three presidents — Trump, Obama, and Bush — have all defended his handling of the case,"" Alexander added.

While Trump and Senate Republicans have broadly taken to Acosta`s defense in the wake of the Epstein scandal or, like Sasse, opted for the wait-and-see approach, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has been more vocal in calling for the president to dismiss the embattled labor secretary, Politico reported Tuesday. Mulvanely told Trump the day prior that ""the continuing drip of damaging information surrounding the 2008 agreement Acosta struck to keep billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein from a heavy jail sentence would hurt the administration.""

Republican Senator Marco Rubio also noted on Twitter on Monday that ""if the DOJ probe uncovers misconduct in Florida plea agreement those responsible should face consequences.""

Democrats want Acosta out

INSIDER received comments from four of the six Democrats who voted for Acosta`s confirmation, including Jon Tester of Montana, Mark Warner of Virginia, and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada. Senator Angus King of Maine, an Independent who caucuses with Democrats, also responded to our inquiry.

Spokespeople for all four senators told INSIDER that they believe Acosta should resign from his post.

Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Bob Menendez of New Jersey did not respond to requests for comment.

King described the allegations against Acosta as ""seriously damning,"" adding ""barring a compelling explanation from Secretary Acosta, I don`t see how he can continue to lead the department."" Others voiced similar sentiment: Warner said ""I wanted to give the Secretary a chance to explain himself, his answers have not been sufficient, and I think the appropriate course is for him to resign,"" while Cortez Masto said, following her review of the recent indictment against Epstein and the reporting from the Herald, that ""it`s clear to me that Secretary Acosta must resign.""

As Democrats continue to pressure Acosta, it remains unclear whether he will respond to the request from Cummings to testify about the non-prosecution agreement, or if he will ultimately resign from his post. The Department of Justice is currently investigating Acosta`s role in negotiating the controversial plea deal.

""My relationship with the president is outstanding,"" Acosta told reporters on Wednesday during his press conference. ""He has very publicly made clear that I`ve got his support. He spoke yesterday in the Oval Office; he and I have spoken.""", Here`s how the senators who voted to confirm Alexander Acosta are reacting to the labor secretary`s role in Jeffrey Epstein`s secret plea deal ,7-2019
"Native American women and girls are facing an epidemic of violence that is hiding in plain sight. They are being killed or trafficked at rates far higher than the rest of the U.S. population ( on some reservations, women are 1 0 times as likely to be murdered as the national average , according to the Justice Department). Some simply disappear, presumably forced into sex trafficking .

These cases often go unsolved. Now, three senators are hoping to combat this epidemic.

The bipartisan bill, called the Not Invisible Act of 2019, was introduced last week by Lisa Murkowski, Republican from Alaska; Catherine Cortez Masto, Democrat from Nevada; and Jon Tester, Democrat from Montana. It aims to change what the Indian Law Resource Center has called a “lack of a diligent and adequate federal response” to these crimes.

The bill would create an advisory committee of local, tribal and federal stakeholders to devise best practices to combat the problem and make recommendations to government — efforts that would include paving a way for federal agencies, law enforcement and elected tribal officials to collaborate more easily.

Cortez Masto told HuffPo that she believed the bill would help federal agencies improve and quicken their response by focusing on why these women and girls are disappearing and where those who are being trafficked are going — as well as on how to collect data and educate law enforcement on sex trafficking and start prosecuting offenders.

Data on the issue is scattershot at best, but here’s some of what is known about the problem:

Alabama

Montgomery: The state will require new forms for getting married beginning Thursday. The Alabama Department of Public Health issued guidance about the new process last week. Instead of a marriage license, couples will fill out a new form, have it notarized and then take it to the probate judge within 30 days. A wedding ceremony is no longer required, but a couple can still have one if they choose. The Legislature this year voted to change marriage procedures to accommodate conservative probate judges who objected to same-sex marriage. A few probate judges had refused to issue marriage licenses to anyone so they didn’t have to give them to gay couples. Republican Sen. Greg Albritton proposed the change, saying it should allow people to get marriage documents everywhere.

Juneau: Charlene Zanoria used her summer internship to give underrepresented cultures a moment in the spotlight. Zanoria, a freshman at University of Alaska Southeast and graduate of Thunder Mountain High School, interned for Juneau Public Libraries this summer. For her connected learning project – an effort that combines interests, supportive relationships and learning – she came up with a celebration of people of color that featured music, dancing and food, Capital City Weekly reports. “I wanted to make an event that would include minorities that aren’t normally represented in the library,” she said. Zanoria, who is Filipina, said she hoped P.O.C. Palooza, which was held Aug. 16, reminded people Juneau Public Libraries are for the entire community. Among featured songs and performances were some that incorporated the Maori culture of New Zealand.

Arizona

Phoenix: The state starts a first-of-its-kind experiment Tuesday. Ninety days after the legislative session ended, the state will roll out a professional licensing law that Gov. Doug Ducey has touted as a game-changing tool to make it easier to move to Arizona and work in a range of regulated fields, from cosmetology to real estate and optometry. Known as universal recognition, the policy was a central part of Ducey’s legislative agenda this year and just one of several steps to roll back the power of state boards that oversee numerous skilled professions. The governor argues that those bodies have, at times, abused their power or gotten in the way of job-seekers. Arizona is the first state to try universal recognition, but the policy’s potential for real change remains unclear.

Little Rock: Cheryl Maples, an attorney who successfully challenged the state’s gay marriage ban before the nation’s highest court said same-sex couples could wed, has died at age 69. Melina Maples-Granger, Maples’ daughter, said Maples died Thursday in Little Rock from complications of congestive heart failure. Maples represented same-sex couples who challenged Arkansas’ constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman. A county judge struck the amendment down in 2014, which led to more than 500 same-sex couples marrying before the ruling was suspended by the state Supreme Court. Justices didn’t rule before the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in 2015. Maples also represented same-sex couples who successfully challenged Arkansas’ birth certificate law.

Los Angeles: Someone has been killing the wild burros of the Mojave Desert, and the Bureau of Land Management is offering up to $10,000 to anyone who can help catch the culprit or culprits. Over the past three months, 42 burro carcasses containing gunshot wounds have been found scattered along a 60-mile stretch of Interstate 15, the main highway linking Los Angeles to Las Vegas. The animals, like wild horses, are protected under federal law. Anyone found guilty of harassing, branding or killing one faces a fine of up to $2,000 and a year in jail. More than that, burros are an enduring symbol of the American Southwest. With their pointy ears and distinctive “Hee-Haw” voices, they evoke a time when their sure-footedness in rocky terrain and ability to carry heavy loads long distances without complaint made them perfect pack animals for prospectors and others.

Colorado Springs: The U.S. Air Force Academy has announced it will close its cadet chapel for extensive renovations beginning next month. KOAA-TV reports the military academy says Sept. 3 is the final day scheduled for visits prior to the chapel’s three-year closure. Officials at the academy near Colorado Springs say a $158 million restoration and preservation project is scheduled to begin Nov. 1. Officials say work crews are expected to remove furniture and conduct other preparation work between Sept. 3 and Nov. 1. The chapel was originally scheduled to close in June, but the project was delayed. The Air Force says the funds were reallocated for repairs at Florida’s Tyndall Air Force Base following Hurricane Michael in October 2018. The chapel is registered as a national historic landmark.

Connecticut

Voluntown: The state plans to conduct mosquito control spraying in parts of Pachaug State Forest considered to be at high risk for mosquito-borne illnesses. Spraying will be conducted Monday at Mount Misery campground, the nearby horse camp, and roads leading from the main forest entrance to Hell Hollow Road. Spraying will begin at 7 p.m., weather permitting. It will continue overnight, and roads will be closed to vehicular traffic. The state’s mosquito management program, an interagency response to mosquito-borne diseases, says there’s a high concentration of mosquitoes in the area infected with Eastern equine encephalitis virus and West Nile virus. The state is using a pesticide called Anvil. Officials say the location is not a residential area, and those living in surrounding areas do not need to take precautions during the spraying.

Delaware

Wilmington: A high-profile case of a doctor convicted of raping and abusing more than 85 children has led to major changes in how the state investigates and disciplines doctors. Since Earl Bradley’s arrest in 2009, 178 Delaware doctors have received some form of disciplinary action from the state. In the decade before that, licensing records show only 48 doctors were disciplined by the state. Bradley’s ability to keep practicing exposed several failures in how the state’s medical community reported and disciplined doctors. The case led to the General Assembly passing a series of laws, one of which made it easier to suspend the license of a doctor who poses a “clear and immediate danger.”

District of Columbia

Washington: As D.C. kids get ready to go back to school Monday, some have more to worry about than the grades, WUSA-TV reports. Those living and going to school in Southeast face the specter of violence every day, with some parents reporting hearing gunfire “almost every night.” One parent tweeted Saturday: “I see DC Public Schools Turner Elementary in Ward 8 still has bullet holes in glass over the front doors after months … kids left being greeted by tape & bullet holes daily, they shouldn’t come back to it.” Within a couple of hours, the D.C. Department of General Services had tweeted that it was investigating. When WUSA paid a visit to Turner Elementary to check out the damage, crews were already working on repairs.

Marathon: A non-native, juvenile olive ridley sea turtle has been released off the Florida Keys. Officials say the 30-pound turtle named Harry was released Thursday with a small satellite transmitter affixed to the top of its shell. The electronic device should provide tracking data to help marine biologists gain insights into the reptile’s movements in unfamiliar territory, before it detaches in two to six months. Harry was rescued by recreational boaters in early February, entangled in a large fishing net, off the Upper Keys. Emaciated and near death, the reptile was transported to the Florida Keys-based Turtle Hospital for treatment. Hospital officials say olive ridley turtles typically live in the southern Atlantic and Pacific oceans. They say only six olive ridleys have been documented in Florida waters.

Georgia

Atlanta: A new report says the state’s public colleges and universities had an economic impact worth $17.7 billion statewide during the 2018 fiscal year. The University System of Georgia said in a news release that the economic impact of its 26 schools increased by 5% over the previous fiscal year. It credited Georgia’s public colleges with creating 168,284 jobs – 70% of which were off-campus positions in the private and public sector. The annual study was conducted by University of Georgia economist Jeffrey Humphreys. The latest report covers the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2018. University system Chancellor Steve Wrigley says the results show that Georgia’s colleges and universities play an “important role in generating jobs and boosting businesses across the state.”

Honolulu: Scientists in the state have started to prepare for a major coral reef bleaching event due to warmer-than-average ocean temperatures. The Star-Advertiser reports the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration analyzed ocean temperatures across the islands and found they’ve risen by 3 degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists say coral bleaching has occurred before, but they are already seeing worse signs at Kealakekua Bay on Hawaii island and at Kaneohe Bay and Hanauma Bay on Oahu. Experts say coral bleaching is a change from normal coloration of browns, yellows and greens to a nearly white color because of increased exposure to environmental stressors, including temperature increases. Scientists say coral reefs are important for marine habitats; have cultural, recreational and economic benefits; and also provide protection for coastal shorelines during storms.

Idaho

Boise: The state must provide gender confirmation surgery to a transgender inmate who has been living as a woman for years but has continuously been housed in a men’s prison, a federal appeals court said Friday. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with a federal judge in Idaho that the state’s denying the surgery for 31-year-old Adree Edmo amounted to cruel and unusual punishment, a violation of the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Under the ruling, Edmo would become the first Idaho inmate to receive gender confirmation surgery while in Idaho Department of Correction custody. “This is a complete win for Ms. Edmo,” said her attorney, Lori Rifkin. “Our client is immensely relieved and grateful that the court recognized her basic right to medical treatment.” Republican Gov. Brad Little said he planned to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Waukegan: The Chicago-area hometown of the late, famed science fiction writer Ray Bradbury marked his birthday with the dedication of a statue in his honor. The 12-foot-tall stainless steel statue outside the Waukegan Public Library depicts Bradbury astride a rocket ship while holding a book. The (Lake County) News-Sun reports artist Zachary Oxman told those at Thursday’s ceremony that the statue tells the story of a man “beaming with unbridled imagination, curiosity and surprise.” Bradbury was born in Waukegan in 1920 and often spoke of the hours he spent at the city’s library before his family moved to Los Angeles when he was a teenager. He died in 2012. He wrote hundreds of works, including “Fahrenheit 451” and “The Martian Chronicles.” The $125,000 project was financed primarily through donations.

Indiana

Portage: The National Park Service has reopened beaches in northwestern Indiana, more than a week after a spill of cyanide and ammonia from a steel factory along Lake Michigan. The agency says three consecutive days of tests came out positive, including two days with no detection of cyanide. The government says samples were taken by Indiana environmental regulators and ArcelorMittal and reviewed by independent labs. The Park Service had closed the Portage Lakefront and Riverwalk beach areas at Indiana Dunes National Park. Fish were killed. ArcelorMittal says the spill occurred after its Burns Harbor mill had a failure at a blast furnace water recirculation system. Wastewater containing elevated levels of ammonia and cyanide was released in the Little Calumet River’s east branch. The company has apologized.

Des Moines: Google gave two local nonprofits $175,000 on Friday through the company’s Impact Challenge Iowa grant program. Five judges picked Iowa Jobs for America’s Graduates and Ethnic Minorities of Burma Advocacy and Resources as winners, along with three other nonprofits. Voters can cast ballots through Friday to pick the “People’s Choice” grant winner, which will receive another $125,000. IJAG is a mentor program that partners graduating students with employers in industries with a lot of job openings. The reward for EMBARC is for its RISE program, which helps prepare refugees for the workforce. The refugees work for other nonprofits in the state through the program, giving them job skills and helping them market themselves in the workforce.

Wichita: City police will begin using a system that places alerts on addresses where potential swatting targets could be living. Swatting involves someone making a hoax emergency call to send law enforcement officers, particularly SWAT teams, to a particular address. The program announced Friday is voluntary and open to people who think they might become victims of swatting. The alerts would be available to first responders. Officer Paul Cruz says the alerts wouldn’t slow emergency responders but would make them aware they might be responding to a hoax call. In 2017, Wichita police fatally shot Andrew Finch after a caller falsely claimed a murder and hostage situation was occurring at his home. The call was aimed at someone who lived at the home before Finch.

Kentucky

Frankfort: A print shop owner who refused to make a gay pride T-shirt argued before the state Supreme Court that he shouldn’t be compelled to promote messages that go against his religious beliefs. Blaine Adamson, owner of Hands-On Originals in Lexington, declined to print a shirt promoting an LGBT pride festival in 2012. The city’s Human Rights Commission said that refusal violated its gay-rights fairness ordinance. On Friday, the high court heard an attorney for the T-shirt maker argue that the First Amendment protects him from having to print that message. An attorney for the Human Rights Commission says the T-shirt maker cannot pick and choose who it wants to serve in the community. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments from attorneys and will issue a ruling at a later date.

Alexandria: One of the world’s northernmost sugarcane fields has been planted at a Louisiana State University research station in central Louisiana. The LSU AgCenter is looking into how well various varieties can survive chilly weather. The Dean Lee Research and Extension Center is generally considered too far north for the tall tropical grass. However, steady yields and prices have prompted some of the state’s farmers to push the limits, planting sugarcane in what has traditionally been corn and soybean country, an AgCenter news release says. One farmer is growing sugarcane a few miles south in the Lecompte area. There’s little data to indicate which varieties can best withstand central Louisiana’s deeper, more frequent freezes. So the AgCenter is working to get such information on eight varieties, some commercially available and some still experimental.

Maine

Millinocket: The Friends of Katahdin Woods and Waters group says it’s pleased with progress in the three years since the national monument was created in northern Maine. The group says improvements include a new bridge over Katahdin Brook, improved trails along the Loop Road at Deasey Pond and the Esker Trail built by Appalachian Mountain Club, and new trail signs put up by the National Park Service. Superintendent Tim Hudson says long-awaited road signs along I-95 and local roads should be going up by year’s end. As the Friends group hosted a celebration Saturday night to mark the third anniversary with music, dinner, awards and an auction, director Andrew Bossie thanked volunteer groups including the Baxter Youth Conservation Corps for their help.

Maryland

Baltimore: City fire officials say they plan to dispatch fewer firefighters to initial fire alarms, as departments see the number of medical emergency calls rise above those of fires. A Wednesday memo said three engines, one truck and one battalion chief will respond to alarms starting Sept. 1, down from the five engines, two trucks, two battalion chiefs and one medic unit that’s considered a full assignment. Seventeen personnel will respond, still higher than the National Fire Protection Association standard of 15. Chief Niles R. Ford told The Baltimore Sun the reduction will free units for medical calls. More responders can be dispatched if needed. Baltimore’s firefighters union criticized the plan, saying it’d put responders and citizens in danger, but Ford pushed back.

Sherborn: A “peace park” in this Boston suburb has been forced to take down a United Nations flag after residents objected. Pacifist Memorial founder Lewis Randa recently removed the flag at the Sherborn site because residents of the condo development where it’s located argue that it violates their property agreement. The Abbey Road Condominium Trust says the 2012 land deal with Randa only allows him to maintain the memorial’s permanent installations, not to add new or temporary ones. But Randa says that while the U.N. flag was not part of the original memorial, one had flown for decades on the grounds. He suggests the dispute is rooted in long-simmering opposition to the memorial. Loretta Heuer, who heads the condo association, says the issue isn’t the flag but respecting property rights.

Michigan

Ishpeming: An arsonist has severely hampered Santa’s toy production this fall. Mlive.com reports that Ishpeming Police on Saturday asked for the public’s help in solving the overnight arson and property damage case involving the Santa’s Workshop building used at Christmastime. Police said officers were dispatched to the site where the building is stored to find the structure destroyed. A city-owned pickup parked in the area was also damaged. Residents expressed their dismay on the police department’s Facebook page. Some offered to rebuild it for free in time for Christmas. One commenter suggested the guilty party rebuild it at no cost in addition to facing criminal charges. Another said that it’s “sad that the actions of a few people can ruin it for so many.”

Minnesota

Duluth: The ever-present danger of rip currents in Lake Superior has some people in Duluth calling for more to be done to improve public safety. Retired police officer Dennis Hoelscher tells Minnesota Public Radio News that lifeguard services need to be improved. Lifeguards don’t work on “red flag” days that have high risk of rip currents. Hoelscher and others think guards should work on those days, work longer hours in general, work more beaches and be trained to work in big waves. The Duluth YMCA, which runs the lifeguard program on Park Point, says posting lifeguards misleads people to think it’s safe. And expanding services is difficult in what is currently mostly a break-even arrangement. MPR reports communities across the Great Lakes struggle with how to pay for lifeguards.

Mississippi

Columbus: Officials say the city was on its way into debt but has turned its finances around, saving about $805,000 since March. The Commercial Dispatch reports Mayor Robert Smith told councilmen last week that the city saved about $329,000 while adding $476,000 to unbudgeted revenue. Accountant Mike Crowder in March told the city it’d be more than $300,000 in debt by September if spending continued. Smith says several decisions helped the city save, like freezes on hiring and wages, upping the employee health insurance deductible from $100 to $500, and opening the court clerk’s office on Fridays, which collected $26,206 in additional fees. Smith says the city had $7 million in its coffers, including about $2 million in the operating funds. It’s unclear whether the fund will finish the fiscal year at a deficit.

Missouri

Kansas City: Authorities say a shirtless man reportedly dragging a topless, unconscious woman through downtown was actually lugging around a life-size doll. Police said in a tweet that callers reported the man looked like he wanted to throw the woman over a bridge, had dropped her and appeared to be trying to dress her. One caller said he was yelling “savior” while holding the woman. Police said that when officers learned the woman actually was a doll that the man had found in a trash bin, he was told “not to carry it around in public anymore.” Police titled the tweet: “And here is today’s episode of ‘Not What We Expected Going Into That.’ ” A traffic camera captured some of the incident.

Montana

Helena: State officials say U.S. health officials have approved Montana’s plan to create a reinsurance pool that aims to lower individual health insurance premium costs. Gov. Steve Bullock and State Auditor Matt Rosendale say the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved a waiver that authorizes the reinsurance program. A bill passed by state lawmakers this year creates a pool to help reimburse insurers for high-cost claims from $40,000 to $1 million. It will be funded with money that otherwise would have been used as premium tax credits and through a premium tax on all major medical plans sold in the state. The three Montana companies that offer health insurance policies on the individual marketplace are proposing reduced rates in 2020, in part because of the reinsurance program.

Nebraska

Lincoln: The state’s highest court lifted one of the last major hurdles for the Keystone XL pipeline in the state Friday when it rejected another attempt to derail the project by opponents who wanted to force the developer to reapply for state approval. The Nebraska Supreme Court upheld the decision of regulators who voted in November 2017 to greenlight a route through the state. The court’s decision was a victory for the $8 billion project, which has been mired in lawsuits and regulatory hearings since it was proposed in 2008. Despite the victory for Canada-based TC Energy, opponents vowed Friday that the legal fight to block construction was far from over. “The risky pipeline project’s fate is still very much in doubt, as three separate federal lawsuits continue to proceed that challenge the controversial project’s permits,” leading pipeline opposition group Bold Alliance said in a statement.

Reno: Safari Club International plans to hold its national convention in Las Vegas in 2021 instead of Reno. The sportsman’s club is ending its initial three-year agreement with the Biggest Little City a year early. The 2020 convention will continue in Reno in February. The club hasn’t officially announced the venue change, but the move has been confirmed by the Reno Sparks Convention and Visitors Authority. RSCVA Board Chairman Bob Lucy says it’s disappointing, but the board continues to have a good relationship with the club and hopes it returns someday. Safari Club returned to Reno this year following a five-year absence and declining attendance in Las Vegas. The RSCVA says this year’s convention generated an estimated $20 million in economic impact for the Reno-Tahoe area, including more than 17,000 room nights for the region’s hotels.

New Hampshire

Concord: A year after Gov. Chris Sununu’s unsuccessful push to prolong school summer vacation until Labor Day, the vast majority of the state’s communities are sticking with their earlier start dates. Schools in 80% of districts will be starting before Labor Day this year. While four districts that started earlier last year will now start after Labor Day, two other districts went the other way. Sununu, a Republican, created a “Save Our Summers Study Commission” last August to explore a mandatory post-Labor Day start date. The group issued a report without taking sides, though it emphasized the economic benefits. Subsequent legislation to enact a mandate, however, was retained in the Senate Education Committee for reconsideration next year. Businesses tied to tourism support later start dates, while teachers oppose the idea.

New Brunswick: Rutgers University’s daily student newspaper will cease print publication on Fridays and shift to reporting more news online. The Daily Targum’s student leaders say the decision to cut their printing days to Mondays to Thursdays is meant to help it stay afloat after a devastating vote last spring resulted in a loss of all student fee funding. NJ.com reports the student newspaper will save money in its $750,000 budget by cutting printing to four days a week. The organization will also save money by tapping into advertising revenue and donations raised online. Rutgers says it will hold another vote to ask students if they want to use student fees to fund the campus newspaper. The paper says it will continue to pay its student reporters, photographers, editors and three-member professional staff.

Bloomfield: The city has asked residents to help fund the remaining balance of fees resulting from a Ten Commandments monument lawsuit. Bloomfield launched an online fundraiser asking for help coming up with $467,000 it owes the American Civil Liberties Union lawyers after courts ruled against the city. Officials say the ACLU represented several residents who said the monument violated their First Amendment rights. Officials say the city owes lawyers $700,000 by June 30, 2021, and has already paid more than $200,000. Anything not raised will be paid for using the gross receipts tax and is currently budgeted. Officials say the resident-funded monument was displayed in front of city hall before being moved to a nearby church.

New York

Tupper Lake: Organizers of a new semi-pro baseball team in the Adirondacks are rooting around for a new nickname after some residents grunted at the proposed moniker “River Pigs.” The Adirondack Daily Enterprise reports that Tupper Lake Village Board Trustee David Maroun posted on Facebook that the name of the new Empire League team will be changed. The name River Pigs was chosen to reflect the region’s logging history. River pigs were skilled loggers who broke up logjams on rivers. But when the team was announced in late July, some Tupper Lake residents said the name “Pigs” sounded demeaning. Fire Chief Royce Cole says the village baseball committee will discuss other options over the weekend. The team is slated to arrive in Tupper Lake next summer.

North Carolina

Raleigh: State election officials on Friday certified bar code ballots for use in elections starting next year despite an outcry that they can’t be trusted by voters uncertain their choices are accurately counted. The State Board of Elections voted 3-2 to allow a voting-machine maker to sell equipment that digitizes votes into bar code data, which is then tallied by the company’s counting machines. Almost two dozen speakers urged the elections board to reject bar code systems because voters can’t read the bar codes to check that they’re correct. But Democratic board chairman Damon Circosta sided with two Republicans on the five-member panel, citing the risk of delay after touchscreen-only equipment is disallowed in December. New voting machines in about a quarter of the state’s counties need to be replaced as primary elections loom in March.

Bismarck: A study finds that converting a historic railroad bridge into a pedestrian bridge can be done but would be expensive. Landscape architecture professors at North Dakota State University looked at repurposing the Bismarck-Mandan Rail Bridge as a footbridge. The Bismarck Tribune reports the study concluded that would cost almost $6.9 million. Proponents of saving the structure acknowledge they don’t yet have any funding commitments. Bridge owner BNSF Railway maintains that converting the 136-year-old bridge – rather than demolishing it – would delay a needed new bridge and also cause safety concerns. The bridge over the Missouri River connects Bismarck and Mandan. Friends of the Rail Bridge is proposing to convert the bridge into a pedestrian and bicycle path.

Dayton: Celebrities and musicians came out Sunday evening for Dave Chappelle’s Gem City Shine benefit. Earlier in the day, Kanye West brought a surprise Sunday Service gospel experience to RiverScape Metro Park. Actor and comedian Jon Stewart made a surprise appearance to help Chappelle introduce Chance the Rapper. Chapelle escorted music legend Stevie Wonder out to perform following Chance the Rapper’s set. The Gem City Shine block party kicked off at 4 p.m. to benefit the families and survivors of the Aug. 4 mass shooting that rocked the city. The sold-out event was held in the Oregon District, blocks away from where a gunman killed nine people and injured 27 others.

Oklahoma

Oklahoma City: The city council is expected to set a citywide vote for a one-cent sales tax that would generate nearly $980 million over eight years to fund dozens of city projects, including money for social services like mental health and homelessness. The proposal outlined Friday is the fourth iteration of Metropolitan Area Projects, a comprehensive capital improvement program first approved by city voters in 1993. The council is expected to consider a resolution Tuesday that calls for a special election Dec. 10. Funding in the MAPS 4 proposal includes $40 million for mental health and addiction services and $38 million for a family justice center offering services to victims of abuse. Another $50 million would be earmarked for affordable housing for the homeless.

Salem: After two walkouts this year by minority Republican senators in the Legislature, Democrats say they’ll ask voters to change quorum rules, allowing the Statehouse to convene with only a simple majority of lawmakers present instead of the current two-thirds requirement. The boycotts by the Republicans prevented the Senate from convening. Democrats dropped proposals on gun control and vaccines, and Democratic Gov. Kate Brown ordered state police to bring the missing lawmakers back during the second walkout. The Republicans left the state to avoid apprehension and returned only after a sweeping bill to combat global warming was moot. Senate Democrats said Majority Leader Ginny Burdick will introduce a constitutional amendment next year to lower quorum requirements. Voters would then decide on the proposed change in the 2020 election.

Philadelphia: Hundreds of bicyclists have been caught with their pants down – and their shirts and underwear off, too. The cyclists gathered in a Philadelphia park Saturday to disrobe before saddling up and setting off on the annual Philly Naked Bike Ride. About 3,000 riders pedal a 10-mile course around the City of Brotherly Love while taking in sights including Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell, organizers say. Some riders wear their birthday suits, while others flaunt their underwear or sport just a splash of body paint and glitter. The ride is intended to promote positive body image, advocate for the safety of cyclists and protest dependence on fossil fuels. It used to be held in September but was moved up to August because the nude and scantily clad participants complained about chilly weather.

Rhode Island

Providence: A state lawmaker says he’s frustrated that mandated replacement license plates will have a design similar to the state’s distinctive “wave” plates in use since 1996. Sen. Louis DiPalma tells the Providence Journal the new design is supposed to make it easier for police to tell from a distance that a plate is old. The Department of Motor Vehicles told lawmakers last week the new plates would maintain the integrity of the current wave design with enough differences to serve the purpose of the plate reissue. Gov. Gina Raimondo’s spokesman says the new design will “closely mirror” existing plates. DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, wants to meet with Raimondo and DMV officials to get an explanation. Rhode Islanders with existing wave plates will have to get new ones starting next year.

South Carolina

North Charleston: The city is giving $1 million to a new African American history museum and asking it to include the city’s story. The North Charleston City Council voted unanimously Thursday to give the money from the city’s taxes on hotels to the International African American Museum being built in Charleston. Mayor Keith Summey says he hopes the money helps tell the story of North Charleston’s predecessor Liberty Hill, where a black couple bought farmland during the Civil War that was later sold to other African Americans. North Charleston’s history also includes racial struggles. The city paid a $6.5 million settlement to the family of a black man, Walter Scott, who was shot in the back and killed by a white police officer in 2015.

South Dakota

Rapid City: A state board is weighing whether to raise bonding requirements for natural gas and oil drillers. The Rapid City Journal reports the Board of Minerals and Environment is considering the increase as the state pursues a $15.5 million lawsuit against a Texas-based company for abandoning gas wells in western South Dakota. Spyglass Cedar Creek drilled 40 natural gas wells near Buffalo and then abandoned them after natural gas prices plummeted. Board members called the Spyglass saga a “perfect storm.” Department of Environment and Natural Resources Minerals and Mining program administrator Mike Lees says the state has not had similar issues with other oil and gas developers in the state.

Knoxville: A baby giraffe has officially been named Big Girl Two but will be called Bea. Zoo Knoxville officials announced the 2-month-old giraffe’s name at a Saturday event for zoo members. They also celebrated the fourth birthday of Bea’s mother, Frances. Frances gave birth to Bea, her first calf, on July 1. Zookeepers found mother and her healthy baby when they arrived for work that morning. Bea is the first giraffe calf born at the zoo in 17 years. She’s part of herd made up of her mother; her father, Jumbe; and female giraffe Lucille. The four live in the zoo’s Africa Grasslands natural habitat.

Waco: More farmers in the state are wading into the whiskey business, but their end users are far removed from the era of moonshine stills and midnight raids by ax-toting lawmen. The Waco Tribune-Herald reports the burgeoning Texas whiskey industry is doubling down on Lone Star pride by recruiting growers. An ode to this phenomenon is High Plains Texas Single Malt, a whiskey produced at Balcones Distilling in Waco using Texas-grown barley malted by Blacklands Malt in Leander. The finished product had its roots in an experiment involving Balcones, Blacklands and Texas A&M University Agrilife, which was exploring ways to develop a barley industry in Texas. Now, after more than two years of aging, High Plains Texas Single Malt has arrived. It is priced at $80 a bottle and available exclusively at Balcones.

Salt Lake City: A new U.S. government management plan unveiled Friday clears the way for coal mining and oil and gas drilling on land that used to be off limits as part of a sprawling national monument in the state before President Donald Trump downsized the protected area two years ago. The plan released by the Bureau of Land Management would also open more lands to cattle grazing and recreation and acknowledges there could be “adverse effects” on land and resources in the monument. But while allowing more activities, the plan would also add a few safeguards for the cliffs, canyons, waterfalls and arches still inside Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument that weren’t in a proposed plan issued last year. Among them are opening fewer acres to ATVs and canceling a plan that would have allowed people to collect some non-dinosaur fossils in certain areas.

Vermont

Colchester: Police are investigating the theft of about $37,000 worth of equipment stolen from a music center during the Lake Champlain Chamber Music Festival. The Tuesday night or Wednesday morning burglary at the Elley Long Music Center in Colchester occurred when at least one person broke into an engineering room and stole a case of audio equipment. Rosina Cannizzaro, the executive director for the Vermont Youth Orchestra Association, calls it a “cowardly act.” She says she hopes the equipment can be returned to the owner. MyNBC5 reports the music center says it has implemented overnight security and will be removing all valuable items like sound gear and cash from the building every night.

Hampton: Gov. Ralph Northam and other state officials are observing the arrival of enslaved Africans to what is now Virginia 400 years ago. Northam said he signed a directive Saturday to create a commission on African American history in the state. He says it will review educational standards and instructional practices to teach black history in the state. Northam says the state must ensure that all students develop a full understanding of the African American voices that contribute to the nation’s story. He made the announcement at the 2019 African Landing Commemorative Ceremony in Hampton. The landing in August 1619 is considered a pivotal moment that presaged a system of race-based slavery.

Tacoma: Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium is celebrating the birth of its first tamandua pup, which is the size of an avocado. KING-TV reports the southern tamandua is a species of anteaters native to South America that lives in trees. The healthy pup was born Aug. 18 and weighs just more than a half-pound. The baby tamandua will make a public debut once it is stronger and more confident. Until then, it will practice riding on its mother’s back and begin eating fruit and insects in about two months. Zookeepers won’t know the baby’s gender until it is older.

West Virginia

Pipestem: Fans of all things horror gathered at Pipestem Event Center on Saturday to visit the first-ever FearFestWV. “It’s important to bring something like this to this area. There are fans of all ages here from age 5 to 75,” said event hostess and personality Coen Beck, also known as Coen the Butcher. Guests enjoyed vendors specializing in horror merchandise, live music of the metal genre and big-name horror actors. With VIP tickets, guests could meet and speak one-on-one with their favorite big-screen menaces. Actors present included Bill Moseley (“The Devil’s Rejects,” “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” and “House of 1000 Corpses”), Michael Berryman (“The Hills Have Eyes,” “The Devil’s Rejects”) and Tony Moran, known for his iconic role of Michael Myers in “Halloween.”

Madison: A rare bee not seen in the state in more than a century has turned up in the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest. U.S. Forest Service scientists found the bee in July while surveying pollinators as part of an inventory of native bees in the Great Lakes region. It’s known commonly as a cuckoo bee, but its scientific name is a mouthful: Epeoloides pilosulus. The bee was once widespread in eastern and central America but was thought to have gone extinct. It was then found in 2002 in Nova Scotia, Canada – and only two such bees have been found since, in Connecticut in 2006 and New York in 2014. Wisconsin has about 500 native bee species.

Wyoming

Casper: The city will begin restoring another stretch of the North Platte River in October, the next step in a long-term project expected to cost at least $23 million. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the upcoming work will cost $2.5 million and cover about half a mile of the river. It will include adjusting the channel, stabilizing the banks, removing debris, restoring native vegetation and installing a boat ramp. The river suffered from decades of pollution from industry and a landfill. The city launched the restoration project in 2015, and the upcoming work will be the fourth of seven planned phases. The city and the Two Fly Foundation, a fly-fishing group, started an annual volunteer cleanup day for the river in 2005. The next event is next month.

"BILLINGS, Mont. - (AP) -- A newly appointed Trump administration official said his past support for selling federal lands was ""irrelevant,"" after his selection to oversee an agency managing nearly a quarter-billion public acres in the U.S. West drew a backlash.

Acting Bureau of Land Management Director William Perry Pendley moved to disavow his longtime advocacy for federal land sales amid continued criticism over his appointment.

The Wyoming native has previously accused government agencies of illegally blocking ranchers, miners and oil and gas companies from profiting off publicly owned range and forest. He argued in a 2016 National Review article that the ""Founding Fathers intended all lands owned by the federal government to be sold.""

Pendley suggested those views have little bearing on his new post, adding that he`s now in an administration that ""adamantly opposes"" the wholesale sale and transfer of public lands.

""I understand the chain of command. I understand and know how to follow orders,"" Pendley told Montana radio station KBUL-AM. ""I get it, so whatever I`ve said and done in the past is irrelevant.""

Western ranchers had welcomed his appointment as evidence that the administration was serious about opening public land to all uses. But it has raised alarm among conservationists, who said it signaled a willingness within the Trump administration to start selling off federal lands.

Tracy Stone-Manning, vice president for public lands at the National Wildlife Federation, rejected Pendley`s claim that his past views were no longer an issue.

""Mr. Pendley clearly has disdain for our public lands and now he`s going to be managing them,"" Stone-Manning said. ""He is bringing a personal value set and a personal belief that public lands have no business being public, which sets him up to fail.""

Federal officials acting on Trump`s orders have sought to make it easier for oil and gas and mining companies to operate on public lands since he took office. They`ve also downsized two national monuments in Utah to scale back protections on sacred tribal lands.

In the radio interview, Pendley said ""Trump is committed to developing all the lands.""

Yet the administration`s critics could not point to any major sales of federal lands to outside entities in the 19 months since the Republican took office.

Interior Department spokeswoman Molly Block said two of Pendley`s initial acts involved land acquisitions, not sales: the first piece of a planned 20.3-square-mile (52.6-square-kilometer) purchase near Montana`s Lower Blackfoot River and 17.4 square miles (45.1 square kilometers) along Oregon`s John Day River.

Perry previously worked as a midlevel Interior Department appointee during the Reagan administration. More recently he led a conservative law firm, the Mountain States Legal Foundation, and championed private companies and ranchers in standoffs with the federal government over grazing and other uses of public lands.

Some legal disputes he was involved with are ongoing, including an attempt to drill for oil and gas in Montana`s Badger-Two Medicine area, which is adjacent to Montana`s Glacier National Park and considered sacred among the Blackfoot tribes of the U.S. and Canada.

U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, asked Pendley to recuse himself from the dispute and all others involving his former law firm and the Interior Department. Pendley has yet to respond, Tester press secretary Roy Loewenstein said.

"Charlie Palmer Steak

Spending: At least $1.3 million

Charlie Palmer, one of the closest high-end spots to the Capitol, has a roof deck that offers unobstructed views of the Capitol’s dome and the Washington Monument. The restaurant is popular with Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi, who spent more than $60,000 at some dozen events there.

Acqua Al 2

Spending: At least $1.1 million

Acqua Al 2, the Capitol Hill outpost of a restaurant based in Florence, Italy, is a favorite of everyone from Ms. Pelosi to Representative Mike Rogers, an Alabama Republican who has spent $26,077 to hold fund-raisers there. The filetto al mirtillo — a filet mignon topped with a blueberry reduction sauce — is the restaurant’s signature dish.

Bistro Bis

Spending: At least $1 million

The French standard in the George Hotel never seems to wane. On any given weekday morning when Congress is in session, tables are filled with members and lobbyists scooping eggs, bacon and breakfast potatoes from a hot pan — a sort of Denny’s experience for the suited crowd. By 5 p.m., large glasses of wine have replaced the morning coffee.

The restaurant’s proximity to the Senate side of the Capitol has made it a draw for Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, who spent $29,000 on a fund-raiser there, and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York and a recent presidential candidate, whose team spent $26,000.

Joe’s Stone Crab

Spending: At least $1 million

The Washington outpost of the famous Miami Beach restaurant known for its stone crabs and key lime pie is a relatively new spot for political fund-raising — it opened in 2014 — but has quickly climbed the list. While members of both parties have events there, its formal feel, including servers in tuxedos, seems to give it an edge with Republicans. Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana, spent about $67,000 at the outpost. Representative Mike Kelly, a Republican of Pennsylvania, spent nearly $36,000. The cocktail reception menu is high-roller comfort food: lump crab cakes, lobster tails, beef tenderloin sliders and Alaskan king crab.

Capital Grille

Spending: At least $730,000

Of all the Capitol Hill-adjacent fund-raising spots, Cap Grille, as it is known colloquially, best fits the bill for a Netflix show depicting life in Washington as the rest of the world imagines it. The service is solicitous and the food just as you would imagine — steaks, decadent lobster mac and cheese, spinach lavished with cream, shrimp cocktail the size of a Midwestern state. Representative John Shimkus, Republican of Illinois, spent $155,000 at the restaurant, and Representative Scott Tipton, Republican of Colorado, spent $21,000. Mr. Scalise likes this place, too: His spending since 2017 has been about $110,000.", Jumbo Shrimp and Lobster Tails: D.C.’s Fund-Raising Hot Spots ,10-2019

By 5 p.m., large glasses of wine have replaced the morning coffee.

The restaurant’s proximity to the Senate side of the Capitol has made it a draw for Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, who spent $29,000 on a fund-raiser there, and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York and a recent presidential candidate, whose team spent $26,000.

Spending: At least $1 million

The Washington outpost of the famous Miami Beach restaurant known for its stone crabs and key lime pie is a relatively new spot for political fund-raising — it opened in 2014 — but has quickly climbed the list. While members of both parties have events there, its formal feel, including servers in tuxedos, seems to give it an edge with Republicans. Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana, spent about $67,000 at the outpost. Representative Mike Kelly, a Republican of Pennsylvania, spent nearly $36,000. The cocktail reception menu is high-roller comfort food: lump crab cakes, lobster tails, beef tenderloin sliders and Alaskan king crab.

(CNN) Rarely has a global corporation as respected and powerful as Boeing been so humbled.

Deep political connections that normally grease the airplane maker`s way in Washington meant nothing on Tuesday, as its CEO endured a fearsome dressing-down on the anniversary of last year`s Lion Air crash. For once, the US Congress did its job famously, as lawmakers finally stumbled on an issue that both Republicans and Democrats care about, not to mention millions of airline passengers around the world.

Watched by bereaved relatives in a Senate committee room, CEO Dennis Muilenburg gave the clearest mea culpa yet for crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia -- both involving Boeing`s 737 Max jet -- that killed 346 people. ""We understand and deserve this scrutiny,"" said Muilenburg, who insisted he wouldn`t resign.

The impact of the twin disasters went beyond the human toll. Faults in Boeing`s safety record were exposed by the jet`s new anti-stall software, as were revelations it had known about problems and failed to properly alert airlines and pilots. The Federal Aviation Administration`s failure to catch glaring issues has also rocked confidence in what were once the gold standards of global flight safety.

American presidents often preside over huge airliner deals during foreign trips, and the Seattle-based firm was once a tool of US soft power. Now its woes are dragging American economic growth and boosting European archrival Airbus. And whenever Boeing`s fixes allow the 737 Max to take wing again, foreign regulators won`t rely on the FAA to certify it as airworthy -- another blow to US prestige.

Can the ill-fated jet, the people who made it and the American institutions behind them win back global public confidence? As Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana put it: ""I would walk before I would get on a 737 Max.""

Impeachment today, in brief

We`ve said it before and we`ll say it again: Today was a blockbuster day in impeachment.

Democrats think they have a killer witness. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the first current West Wing official to testify, was on the now-notorious call between Trump and Ukraine`s President, and said he was so alarmed by what he had heard that he twice tried to warn superiors.

One way to tell Vindman`s testimony was significant: Conservative media commentators launched a smear campaign. Several questioned the patriotism of the wounded Iraq War veteran, who was born in Soviet Ukraine before fleeing to the US as a refugee.

Democrats unveiled a resolution setting down the rules and future scope of their investigation ahead of a Rules Committee vote on Wednesday, to send the measure to a historic full House of Representatives vote the next day. It`s the first formal move towards impeaching Trump.

Meanwhile in Beirut

A supporter of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri burns garbage containers to block a main road in Beirut, Lebanon, Tuesday, Oct. 29, 2019.

CNN`s Ben Wedeman writes to Meanwhile from Beirut:

""Anti-government protesters cheered the resignation of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Al-Hariri`s government on Tuesday. Hariri had been caught between the rock of mass, nationwide demonstrations and the hard place of his (barely) unity government -- and when promises of reform didn`t take the edge off the protests, he saw no other way out. With no clear successor in place, Hariri will now likely lead a caretaker government, which will be hobbled in its ability to deal with the country`s impending economic collapse.

""Meanwhile, Hezbollah supporters have attacked Beirut`s anti-government protesters twice in the past five days. Already feeling the pinch from US sanctions on Iran and itself, the party is believed to have been alarmed to find that many of its working class Shia constituents joined the anti-government protests. Last week, Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah called upon his supporters to leave the demonstrations.

""Two weeks of protests, sporadic violence and mounting tensions have already closed banks, schools and universities, creating a sense that Lebanon has entered a period of profound volatility.""

`I am happy -- and yet`

Lebanese activist Rana Khoury told CNN`s Becky Anderson that Hariri`s resignation may show that the government can bend to popular demand. ""We were used to Arab governments or Arab regimes not letting their people win, or be happy, but this revolution has proved that it`s possible,"" she said, later adding: ""I am happy -- and yet, I don`t have the trust that they will let us be happy.""

Number of the day: 21%

That`s how Bernie Sanders is polling in CNN`s latest survey of support for Democratic candidates in New Hampshire (the second state to vote). 21% is good enough for the lead -- but in a sign of how open the race remains, the Vermont Senator also the weakest front runner at this stage of the primary in 47 years.", What Boeing`s humbling means for America ,10-2019

"Russell Dotson served 22 years with the U.S. Navy, active duty and reserve. A decorated senior chief boatswain’s mate, he was deployed overseas six times, each for a year. In 2010, he saved two lives in a rocket attack and ground assault in Kandahar, Afghanistan.

His service took a toll. His marriage didn’t survive. His children worried about him — a lot.

“I was gone for a year, home for a year, gone for a year, home for a year,” he says. “The whole family paid a price for that.”

His daughter, Paige Dotson, 22, says: “I didn’t see my dad for six years. I thought he was going to die.”

When the Navy told Dotson that, if he would re-enlist for another four years, he could transfer his Post-9/11 GI Bill educational benefit to Paige and her brother for college, he didn’t hesitate. His children each would get two years of schooling paid, giving them a shot to be the first college graduates in their family.

Dotson, who’s from Michigan, didn’t know that the promised education would be yanked out from under them, that this gift would turn into debt-collection notices for his daughter amounting to $20,000 and growing.

The Dotsons are among military families on the hook for huge, unexpected bills for college they were promised would be covered by a government plan that for years has come under fire. Some children of veterans went to college, only to be told there was an error with their parents’ applications, and the funds would be cut off.

“A lot of time, they don’t even know something is wrong,” says Vadim Panasyuk, a senior manager with the nonprofit organization Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.

Panasyuk says he’s heard from more than 40 families who were shocked to find their GI Bill benefits canceled. One family was told: You now owed the government $60,000.

“It’s heartbreaking,” he says. “It really ruins the financial stability of some of our longest-serving families. It’s folks that gave their all for their country — their youth, their health, everything.”

The Post-9/11 GI Bill, signed into law in 2008, covers veterans who served in the military after Sept. 11, 2001. It’s meant to pay college tuition, books and housing for veterans, much like the post-World War II GI Bill that helped boost the middle class.

But there have been numerous complaints. Initially, much of the funding was going to for-profit colleges. Last year, some vets saw their housing payments delayed because of administrative glitches.

Being able to transfer the education benefit to your dependents has become a key retention tool for military services stretched thin by deployments. Branches have enticed service members to agree to re-enlist for four more years by offering the chance to pass the education benefit to a child or spouse.

But the rules have tripped up some families.

In Russell Dotson’s case, his service record was beyond dispute. In 2010, while supporting a construction battalion in Kandahar during a ground assault and rocket attack on the base, he rushed to the site of an explosion, gave first aid to a NATO contractor, then used his bare hands to stanch the bleeding of a wounded Marine.

“His quick reaction in the face of enemy fire was undoubtedly crucial in saving the life of the U.S. Marine and contractor,” his superiors wrote of Dotson’s “decisive and selfless actions.”

Then, nearing the end of what he’d planned to have been his final four-year commitment — the re-enlistment he made to get the college benefit for his kids — Dotson, 51, says he met with his command’s career counselor to make sure all of his years of service added up. He says he was told he was good to go.

Soon after, his daughter enrolled in college in Chicago at DePaul University.

Everything was going well until, toward the end of second quarter freshman year, the government stopped making payments to DePaul for her tuition and housing.

Even worse, they told her she had to repay what already was paid — more than $20,000 including interest. She ended up having to transfer to the University of Michigan, where she could get in-state tuition but still is working three part-time jobs, in addition to getting loans.

Russell Dotson says he learned, too late, that even though his command staff told him he could retire, the Defense Department used the date of his benefit-transfer application — rather than his re-enlistment date — to calculate his service time. That left him 89 days short.

As a reservist serving one weekend a month, that 89 days actually meant all he would have needed to qualify was six days of weekend service. He says he had plenty of unused “authorized absence” days that could cover the six days — if Navy officials would switch his retirement date in their records. He says they have refused.

“They made a math mistake,” Dotson, now working as a corporate recruiter, says of the Navy staffer who advised him on what he needed. “I owed them six damn days.”

His uniform still fits. He says he would put it back on and serve the six days if the Navy would let him.

“I don’t have $20,000 to give back to the federal government,” Dotson says. “And my daughter doesn’t, either. Yes, my career is my responsibility. I just want to fix it. It’s six stupid days.”

Retired Lt. Col. Todd Grant got a similar shock after 23 years in the Air Force, including a final four-year re-enlistment so he could transfer his education benefit to his children. Grant, 49, a weapons system officer who lives in Virginia, was deployed seven times and flew more than 500 combat hours.

As a boy growing up in Rhode Island, he admired his three uncles who served in Vietnam and his grandfather, who served during World War II.

“I wanted to protect my fellow Americans; I wanted to do the right thing,” Grant says of what military service means to him. “I wanted to serve and protect the Constitution of the United States. That’s important to me.”

He hoped that helping his children be able to go to college would help make up for all the missed birthdays and Christmases.

“Military life isn’t the easiest sometimes,” Grant says.

When Grant left the Air Force in 2016, the Defense Department confirmed in writing he had earned a total of four years of college to transfer to his children. But just as his son was entering the University of Central Florida last fall, the federal Department of Veterans Affairs said their funding was being cut — to just five months rather than four years of college — because Grant had gone to college in the 1990s under the previous GI Bill.

Grant says he asked an Air Force counselor specifically about whether that would be an issue before he re-enlisted. “They said: ‘Yes, you’re eligible.’ And I said: ‘Are you sure?’ And they said, ‘Yes, you’re eligible.’ Being a good airman, I trusted my chain of command, and I trusted my service.”

Now, Grant wishes he would have not re-enlisted for those final four years, returned to civilian life, worked and saved for his college for his children.

“I know the rules have gotten really convoluted, and that’s why I relied on the Air Force to tell me the real information,” he says. “I don’t want this to happen to anyone else.”

It’s difficult to correct such errors after the fact, according to Panasyuk, from the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans’ group. Trying to abide by the rules can be complicated by the differing dates for when a service member elects to re-enlist and when they opt to transfer their benefit.

When someone is given poor guidance by the service member’s military branch, the attitude often is “tough luck,” according to Panasyuk, who says that’s “appalling, disgraceful and completely unacceptable. You would think you could say, ‘You guys failed me on this.’ But they say, ‘That’s not our problem.’ ”

Last year, the government announced that as of July, service members who had served more than 16 years would no longer be able to transfer their benefit to dependents. That deadline was later extended to January 2020 amid complaints that the policy would penalize those who’d served the longest, many of them who’d delayed having children while they were off fighting wars.

Legislation introduced in Congress in September by Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, Jon Tester, D-Montana, and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, aims to untangle some of the complex rules and make it easier for veterans to claim the educational benefits. Their proposed Post-9/11 GI Bill Transferability Entitlement Act would allow any service member who has completed at least 10 years to transfer benefits to their dependents at any time — while on active duty or as a veteran.

The bill has support from the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States and the Reserve Enlisted Association. Daniel Elkins, legislative director for the National Guard group, says the government needs to stop making service members jump through complicated hoops.

“You’ve served your country, and you should be able to transfer your benefit,” Elkins says. “We don’t think there should be a timeline on that.”", The Navy told him he served long enough to get his kids free college. Their math was 6 days off. ,11-2019
"Kelli Hower was six months pregnant with her first child last spring when the phone call came.

At first, the Michigan woman thought it was a scammer. But it turned out to be all too real.

The caller was a debt collector, on contract with the U.S. Treasury Department. And he had bad news: Hower owed the federal government $12,000 for college tuition payments and living expenses she’d received through her veteran father’s benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.

Hower, 30, couldn’t believe it. To start, those were benefits she’d used years ago. And her father Bruce Coxworth, 57, of Swartz Creek, Michigan, had earned them. He’d served 22-1/2 years as a military police officer with the Army National Guard, with active-duty assignments that took him far from home.

“They said, ‘You owe the federal government $12,000 — and we need it now,’ ” Hower says. “I started crying. I said, ‘I never got any letters, so what are you talking about?’ ”

Hower and her father are among more than a dozen families who contacted the Chicago Sun-Times after a story Nov. 10 on military families hit with hefty college bills they were promised would be covered by the government under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.

The rules are complicated. Service members, relying on those whose job it is to advise them, later find they were told in error they’d put in enough time to qualify to share the college benefits with their dependents.

Two veterans described staying in the military four extra years because they were told, erroneously as things turned out, that would qualify them. One later learned he was six weekend service days short of qualifying.

For the past decade, an overextended U.S. military has dangled the ability to transfer these GI Bill benefits to spouses or children to entice service members to stay in longer. If they agree to re-enlist or extend their service, those who qualify can pass along four years of college paid for by the government, including tuition, housing and books.

But veterans have described being given incorrect information at the time of their discharge or retirement, mistakes they learned of only when their children enrolled in college or even later, and the government demanded the money be repaid with interest.

These families describe having their children’s college payments withdrawn and then being told the college money is still available but only for the veterans if they want to go to school themselves.

“That really concerns us,” says Steve Patterson, spokesman for the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States, which is backing legislation to simplify benefit transfers. “It’s something that needs to be looked at.”

U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, whose staff is in touch with the family of a former DePaul student whose benefits were pulled, said: “Our veterans and their families should not lose these critical benefits because of bureaucratic mumbo jumbo. I’m prepared to re-write the law to give our vets the benefits they were promised.”

Hower’s father served honorably with the Army National Guard for more than 22 years as a sergeant first class and military police officer. He did active-duty and reserve stints and registered to split his education benefits among his children, who’d each use a portion to offset their college costs.

As he neared retirement, Coxworth says his records were reviewed at his unit, then by National Guard personnel in Michigan and that he was told he’d fulfilled his commitments.

His eldest son and daughter together used about 22 months of his GI Bill benefit, he for a community college degree and Hower for part of her bachelor’s degree and a master’s.

Then, last year, their younger brother put in a request to use his portion for college. The federal Department of Veterans Affairs said no, then delivered a shock. Its records showed Coxworth was five months shy of the service time he needed — the equivalent of 10 drill days, as National Guard members train one weekend a month — and couldn’t transfer his benefit.

And the government demanded close to $18,000 in past payments from Coxworth’s son and about $12,000 from his daughter.

The VA says Coxworth still could use the money for his own schooling, just not for his children, as he planned.

In a letter to his son, the VA wrote: “You might consider seeking repayment assistance from your veteran parent ... If you [sic] parent utilizes his restored education benefits, that could provide increased family income.”

Coxworth, 57, says it’s preposterous to suggest he use the GI Bill money in hopes he’d make more money later on so he could help his kids repay the government.

“I couldn’t believe it,” Coxworth says. “I was bowled over.”

His daughter’s debt ballooned with penalties and interest. It ended up going to a collection agency after, she says, letters sent by the VA — addressed incorrectly, she later discovered — never reached her. She says her credit score fell 132 points, and her income-tax refund was garnished.

Reluctantly, she tapped into savings set aside to extend her maternity leave. “We had to use that money to pay this off, so I had to go back to work earlier than planned,” she says.

Coxworth says he trusted the National Guard staff member who tallied his service time as he reached retirement and told him his obligations had been met.

Now, he’s trying to get his duty credits adjusted or get permission to come back and perform 10 days of service. But the family has been told it could take up to two years to get a decision from an Army review board.

“I just think it’s a broken system,” says Hower, who works in human resources for the state of Michigan.

Gary Miller of Oneida, New York, says he, too, was given bad information on Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. He served 33 years active duty as a technical sergeant in the Air Force and says he was told he could transfer his college benefits to his children.

His daughter, now 22, used her father’s benefits to attend three semesters at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut in 2015 and 2016, with the VA covering her tuition and housing.

Then, the government suddenly stopped paying, saying Miller retired too early to be able to transfer the benefit — and that his daughter had to repay about $69,000.

The family is appealing the decision.

“I spent 30 years in the military, to have this pulled out from under me,” Miller says.

Other vets and their families told the Sun-Times information was miscommunicated during their service or as they were getting ready to exit. In some cases, they say, command staff or civilian contractors — hired to meet with soldiers, sailors or airmen — apparently weren’t knowledgeable about service requirements.

A senior manager with the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America organization told the Sun-Times he’s heard from more than 40 families who’ve had benefits yanked back, with some facing debts of nearly $60,000.

Legislation introduced in September by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, Sen. Jon Tester, D-Montana, and Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, would simplify the rules on transferability. The Post-9/11 GI Bill Transferability Entitlement Act would allow any service member who has served at least 10 years to transfer benefits to their dependents at any time — while on active duty or as a veteran.

The Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States and the Reserve Enlisted Association are backing the bill.

Other vets say they have had problems accessing their GI Bill benefits even for themselves.

Kevin Carroll, of Farmington Hills, Michigan, was an Army artillery officer from 2008 to 2012 before being medically retired over a back injury suffered in a training jump. Carroll says he was told by a contractor doing his exit counseling he’d met all requirements to get his GI Bill benefit.

Six years later, when he wanted to use it to get a master’s of business administration at Michigan State University, Carroll says he was told he was three days short — which he would have stayed in and served had he been given the correct information.

“I was literally sick to my stomach,” Carroll says of getting the news. “I got screwed on this, and there’s no other way to describe it.”

He says he’ll end up with about $70,000 in student loans to finance his schooling.

Chicagoan Vince Perritano got a similar surprise trying to tap his benefit for graduate school. The former Marine sergeant had served from 2004 to 2008, doing two tours in Iraq, where he was wounded by an improvised explosive device.

Perritano says he enlisted at 18 with a sense of idealism, to challenge himself and to get a free education.

After serving, Perritano, now 34, used some of his GI Bill benefit to complete a bachelor’s degree at Columbia College Chicago. He says he was careful to carry a less-than-full courseload in hopes of stretching his benefit to cover most of a master’s degree.

But he later found that errors with his VA records cut his benefit short by a semester or more. Discouraged by “an impossible amount of paperwork” to try to prove the mistake, he first left it unaddressed but now is trying to correct his record. Meanwhile, his grad school plans are on hold because he doesn’t want to take out loans.

“I’m allergic to debt,” Perritano jokes. Then, he gets serious. “I put my life on the line in Iraq so I would not have to pay for college.”", More GI Bill horror stories: Vets say government reneged on promise to pay for kids’ college ,11-2019
